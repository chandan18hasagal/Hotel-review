"hotel_104","hotel_4342","Awesome Everything about this resort was great. My wife and I had such a wonderful time that we are already looking for flights to go back. The resort is spectacular! The staff is extremely friendly and they were all very helpful. Everywhere we went the folks were really nice, either the bar, the beach, the front desk, room service or house cleaning. It's a really great place for couples because of the location of the hotel, which is in south Puerto Rico, far far away from the hectic hustle and bustle of San Juan. And because it's so far away from the high-traffic, high-pollution San Juan, the weather is much better than San Juan. We landed in San Juan and it was raining. Then we went on a one-day trip to San Juan and it was raining. Then on the flight back, it was raining again in San Juan. We stayed in Ponce 6 days and it DID NOT rain even once. The closest it got was a bit overcast in the evening one night. The breakfast is awesome! The other two restaurants at the resort are awesome! We had so much fun that we didn't even go to the Casino. We highly recommend this resort for anyone looking for a romantic getaway or with a family with kids.","Jan 5, 2009","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_2024","Convenient  When I say Above Average I'm comparing to sparse alternative offerings in the Ponce area (and being an avid golfer, this place having no competition in the south central portion to the island). The resort was easy to get to and conveniently located, but it (in the greater worldwide scheme of things) wasn't anything close to special. Furthermore (aside from the outstanding 27 hole on site golf course), it was not redeeming other than it was situated on the ocean (to be more precise, the Carribean Sea) and had two separate pool and beach areas (one moderate size family pool with large beach area at hotel, and another dazzling adult pool with small beach area at the golf course clubhouse complex). We ate out in town, but availed ourselves to the bar lounge area (good, but expensive mixed drinks and beer) and to the casino (okay, but not exciting and no Vegas - or Mesquite, for that matter). The rooms were clean and all have a view toward the ocean overlooking the gardened grounds, but it was not spacious or memorable. At this low season stay, we still had to pay a AAA rate of $160 and pony up an extra $8 parking fee (for the priviledge of parking in one of several hundred unsused spaces in a cavernous parking lot) as well as a $11+ resort fee (were told to pay for groundskeeping costs). All in all, this single night stay (and playing the full 27 holes of golf) was fine and dandy, but it doesn't beckon to me to pay a return visit.","Nov 10, 2008","0","0",4,4,6,5,4,5,1,"4","$227"

"hotel_104","hotel_3267","Always a 5 star stay! Its always a good trip when you stay at the Ponce Hilton in Ponce Puerto Rico. I just spent 4 days and 3 nights at this facility and as usual I found it clean, the staff extremely friendly, and there was nothing you could need that was not available. Granted this is a 5 star resort, so if your looking for a bare bones cheap stay this is not the place. But if you want to be catered to, have the staff not only know who you are but be able to address you by name. If you want every possible type of food in what ever amount you want at a moments notice. If you want immediate access to 5 restaurants and 7 bars, a business center and an executive lounge. If you want full service spa's, training areas, casinos, night clubs, etc. then this is the place for you! If this sound like your kind of place the run, don't walk to the Costa Caribe Ponce Hilton.","Sep 30, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_5419","Loved It! The hotel is beautiful with spectacular views. Staff are friendly and kind. I've seen remarks written about the double beds and it is true. Double beds not much larger than a single. Our room was right off the pool and feet from the beach. Retrieving the car was simple and quick. The breakfast was great. I would definitely come back. The only major thing we had a problem with but through no fault of the hotel was the putrid smell from the Don Q rum factory. It's enough to make you upchuck. Other than that - GREAT TIME. Check in/Check out - 123.","Aug 29, 2008","3","2",6,4,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_1141","Executive Tower the Best Bet This hotel is the best in town. And the best deal is to be upgraded to the Executive Tower -- which gives you access to the lounge with (2) computers (free) to check email, continental breakfasts, afternoon snacks, cold drinks, tea/coffee, and at 5:30 pm small sandwiches and crudites, at 7:30 desert and liquers. In the evening, the honor bar is quite reasonable -- $5 for a glass of wine. You could make some of your meals here from the snacks and certainly save on expensive sodas, etc etc. Plus the concierge person manning the desk there can assist with tourist info, restaurants, etc. etc. The hotel isn't perfect -- it took 2 days to find out about the valet parking set up -- we were stopping at the desk each time to get our ticket stamped. Nothing was actually every explained to us about their faciities or various options. We had to explore and learn on our own. And if you are with a family -- keep in mind that their double beds are barely larger than a single; okay for very small kids only.That being said -- the main pool is the one for families and children. If you are an older (or romantic) couple and wish a bit less noise, you can take the shuttle (from the front of the hotel) to the country club and use their hot tub and pool. They will ask you to register at the hut where you get your towels (and you're given a wrist band to wear) but during the day the place is so much calmer. At either location there is a very small black sand beach...nothing to write home about ; it might entertain you for a very short walk to find some shells or old pieces of polished glass but not to sit on (although there are a few chairs at each). Keep in mind that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for the shuttle to ever show up -- there's no set schedule.We only ate a couple meals at the hotel -- one lunch at the pool bar -- decent. Had the chicken fingers which came with fries (only $12) from the appetizer list. Sodas were around $3 each. The other meal we had was at the Sushi restaurant (not open everyday) at the country club part. This was just okay. A bit disappointing with limited selections but good for a change from fried foods and mofongos..and yes, expensive for the portions served. For kids -- there is the pool as mentioned, a playground area near the beach, and a small arcade area inside that was kept quite busy. For adults -- there is entertainment advertised on the weekends. Wasn't there then so no idea whether this is worth it or not. The casino is small but decent. Had variety of slots/machines and games. Wasn't very crowded or busy when we were there.The fitness room -- is decently equipped. Has the usual machines and is conveniently located near the main pool. You must be 18 to use machines.They have a spa/sauna == saw their signs but never had a chance to investigate.Did the two hour city tour (only one now available); you can drive up to see several other sites (may be next time) but didn't have the car at the time. Cab from downtown only cost $10 plus tip to Hilton. People at hotel basically quite friendly and helpful. Material distributed not always up to date, however, so do call (or have them call for you).Directions -- As in all of Puerto Rico, directions are horrible and not very accurate (even the Garmin GPS was off). You will be told go right and it's a left and vice versa. Allow yourself time to get anywhere you are going if this is the first time you're there. Many streets are not marked (signs are down or names change as you drive) plus there is a lot of construction on Rte 2 heading west towards Mayaguez (if going to Pitos restaurant -- recommended by the way)","Jul 28, 2008","5","5",4,4,3,5,3,5,6,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_6172","Wonderful Hotel!!! This hotel was great! The room was immaculate, the sheets  bedspreads (which I'm very picky about) were plush, soft, super clean, no complaints about that. The room itself, when I first walked in, smelled deodorized  properly kept.The pool area was beautiful, the terrace with the colossal columns  dangling lights contributes to a feel of tropical elegance. Gym was OK, but would like them to add more treadmills. But the crown of our stay was the Rest La Cava. As soon as we walked in, the services just outstanding. The waiter  host were professional and proper, yet friendly. They were about to close the restaurant, but decided to cater to us regardless. We contemplated the bottles of wines (and the price tags) of wines from all over the world. The food was fresh, and elegantly served. The souffle for dessert, I still crave to this day its delicious grand manier flavor. Would definitely go back!

"hotel_104","hotel_8279","A great resort destination! I loved my two-week stay here! Great breakfasts, lunches and dinners.

"hotel_104","hotel_6230","Best Pina Coladas in all of Puerto Rico The one thing about this hotel is...Best Pina Coladas in all of Puerto Rico. The bartenders (yes all of them) at the sports bar by the pool have a serious bad attitude but they can make a awesome Pina Colada. The resort could use a remodel. It is dated. The staff at the front desk is friendly. The rooms are okay, definitely not U.S. standards for cleanliness. The fine dining restaurant is expensive but very romantic and has good food. There is nothing in Ponce to do. We went to the boardwalk marina area but it was boring. No shops or restaurants. Just a bunch of bars that were the size of a tool shed.

I had reserved the suite suitable for 6 people and then gave my room to someone else then gave me (without asking me first) a room suitable for 2 people. When i came back to the desk to explain it took almost 2 hours to correct the problem, which they said was now 3 rooms in the executive tower. But they didn't mention that one room had a murphy bed with no blankets! ahh. The beach here is almost not swim worthy. It is black sand and covered in rocks. The pool is WAY overcrowded.

"hotel_104","hotel_3194","Excellent Staff, Nice Hotel, Not Activities Destination My husband and I booked this trip as a graduation present for my nephew. We selected Ponce, due to its location on the Caribbean side of Puerto Rico. Overall, the hotel was clean, the staff was extremely accommodating, and we enjoyed our 6 day stay. It wasn't perfect in all respects, but setting proper expectations for the ages and interests of those in your travel party could help when deciding on this property. Below is a recap of our experiences.Staff- Excellent. Upon arrival, we were given a standard room in the Executive Tower. (2 double beds and a single person sofa bed -all in one room) for my husband and me and two 18 year olds teens. We booked a two room suite, so this was unacceptable. After much hard work from Rose Maria Alvarez, the hotel day supervisor, she rectified our situation and we were given side by side rooms. Kudos to her for recognizing the importance of honoring reservations, providing good customer service, and maintaining the loyalty of a Gold Hilton Honors member. We were also impressed by the valet staff that drove us to the Golf club each day, and the activities staff member at the club who helped us push our kayaks (and assist my nephew in getting back in).Food and Accommodation - Stay in the executive tower if you can. It is newer, and you have access to the Executive lounge. A continental breakfast was free each day, and they also had free drinks while you were in the lounge (sodas, waters, juices, etc.) The food at the hotel is average at best. Bar food at the pools, or two buffets (one at the hotel and one at the golf club). For lunch, the buffets are $22. We purchased a buffet discount coupon booklet that provided 10 lunch buffets @ $13 a piece. We would check out the items on the hotel buffet first and then decide if we wanted to ride over to the Golf Club buffet for another option. In general, the food and the view are better at the Golf club. RENT A CAR! We did, and ate dinner out near the mall in Ponce each night. It is about 5 miles away, but you'll want to leave the property as there is nothing else to do around the hotel. While there is a mini mart and gift shop on the property, we bought snacks, soda and water at a store near the mall. The rooms had refrigerators, and with sodas at $2.25 a pop at the hotel, you'll save some money.Activities - My husband and I planned to dive using a shop in Ponce and a shop in Guanica. Unfortunately, not enough divers for EITHER shop to go out, so no diving for us the entire week. This was extremely disappointing and bizarre for the Caribbean. My husband played golf at the resort on 2 days. I spent most of my time at the Golf club pool and beach, which is much nicer and quieter than the hotel pool and beach. Despite being on the Caribbean side of PR, the water is not crystal blue as you would typically expect if you've been to other Caribbean destinations. Sand is brown/gray. Not great, but ok. We also used the fitness center which has old equipment, but has everything you need from machines to free weights. In short, this was a relaxing break from work, but not the dive trip we had hoped for.The 18 year olds in our party struggled a bit. While there was tennis, basketball, table tennis, and the pools, they became somewhat bored after a few days. There are no planned activities (like volleyball games and other activities that you typically find at beach resorts). There seemed to be a lot of locals there that were part of a summer club and weren't too accepting of the guests. With nothing around the hotel to do either, they relaxed a lot. :)Despite this, we are not too hard to please and enjoyed the time away. I hope this information helps those reading to determine if this is the best setting for you. At the end of the day, the hotel was clean, offered good amenities, and is the right choice for those wanting to simply get away and relax.","Jun 14, 2008","2","2",4,5,4,6,5,6,6,"4","$227"

But the actual hotel looked like it hadn't been renovated since the 80's,  it was not very clean, our room smelled like a bad car freshner, we didn't even have a duvet cover on our bed there were just two sheets wrapped around the dirty comforter, the food was just OK, I guess I just expect more when you are paying 250 a night.","May 9, 2008","0","0",3,3,5,2,2,3,1,"4","$227"

The room was very large and clean. The king size bed was very comfortable. I would recommend staying in the Executive Towers because you have access to a continental breakfast and the Internet in the executive lounge. I highly recommend eating at Sancho's Sushi at the hotel. They have the best sushi and the service was awesome! Definitely rent a car when staying in Puerto Rico. There are so many beautiful beaches around the country within several miles. There are tolls on some of the roads so make sure you have quarters. Driving is simple as long as you stay on the main highways. Once you start getting off the main highways the roads are very narrow and scary.

"hotel_104","hotel_7852","Had a Fabulous time We had a great time at this resort. There is so much to do at the resort that we only went into town twice. Once to see the historic square and once for dinner. We had an ocean view room on the third floor of one of the executive towers. The day we checked in, the hotel was so uncrowded that we wonder how the stay open. We are glad they do. Our room was large and spotlessly clean. The view from our balcony of the ocean was as good as any I've seen anywhere. We were on a golf package and played the Caribe Country Club for three days. If you think the hotel is uncrowded, you should see the golf course. One day we started at 9:00 a.m. and we were the only two people on the course for the first hour. The course are in very nice condition and enjoyable to play. The only drawbacks to this property are the pool, which is basically a kiddies pool and the price of the food. Portions are plentiful (too large actually) and the quality is good but the prics are a bit high. Fortunately, it is a short cab ride or drive into town to get some excellent seafood at more reasonable prices. Bottom line is we enjoyed ourselves so much, we are considering a week at this resort in the future.","Jan 29, 2008","1","1",5,5,5,6,6,6,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_9353","Lovely stay We stayed here at the end of December 2007 for one night. The hotel has lovely gardens with fish, ducks, and turtles -- great for entertaining the kiddo. The pool is small but nice, and is saltwater. Because we were here for one night only, we didn't have time to enjoy a lot of the other amenities the hotel offers. If you're not into gambling, don't let the casino scare you. We didn't even know where it was until we were checking out. Unlike Las Vegas, the casino is behind double doors with a small sign, so it's easy to avoid. Our only complaint was that the hair dryer in the bathroom didn't work well, but it wasn't a big deal. Just a warning when traveling to Ponce -- nothing about the hotel here, but it is a buggy place. This was our second trip to the town (first to the Hilton) and both times, the bugs ate us up. Take lots of bug spray.","Jan 4, 2008","3","3",4,5,4,5,5,5,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_9738","Great weekend away My boyfriend and I traveled to Puerto Rico to visit his parents but we wanted to get away for the weekend. This was the only place we could find with availability (even a month in advance). We were pleasantly surprised. The lobby was large and clean and the front desk personnel were helpful and friendly. We thought the room was modern and clean, and had a small fridge. Our room was ocean/pool view on the first level and we loved being able to walk right out to the beach. The hotel hosted a corporate family day on our last day and set up a huge tent almost right in front of our room. The crew was noisy constructing the tents, so we contacted the front desk and they offered a different room with a worse view, so we stayed. The pool was very small but clean with lots of kids around. We appreciated that the hottub stayed open all night. The sports bar by the pool served good (strong) drinks and good bar-type food. The lobby bar could be loud at night with the entertainment, The beach was windy and the sand was gray -- not overly exciting. We took the free shuttle over to the Costa Caribe Golf Resort pool one day -- they had a much larger and prettier pool, better chairs with umbrellas, decent beach, better poolside bar and slightly larger food menu, and a fabulous view of the golf course and mountains. It's worth it to go use that pool. Overall, we had a great weekend and were comfortable. It's a typical nice large resort. Staff was nice and the hotel was clean.

"hotel_104","hotel_1268","Go Somewhere Else If you can, go somewhere else in the Caribbean. Ponce, as a town, is pretty awful, with nothing to see, many abandoned buildings and little to do outside of going to the beach, which definitely has some shady people loitering around. As for the hotel, I'm sure it was nice... 25 years ago. Currently, it's tired and doesn't deserve the category 5 rating it gets from Hilton. As a caveat, I don't have a family, and this hotel is big on kid-friendly activities, and I didn't play golf, so individuals with those travel requirements may feel differently. But in a word, I found this hotel disappointing. I have stayed at Hilton's in Hawaii (Hawaiin Village) and Barbados, as well at other hotels (Marriott  Sheraton) in St. Thomas and Bermuda. I found all of those hotels far exceed the quality of accommodations and service at the Ponce Hilton. The rooms here have turquoise industrial-quality tile (think nursing home), turquoise walls and 2 rugs on each side of the bed that look like they are from wal-mart. The luxury bathrooms you expect at such a hotel are non-existent. The bathrooms are utilitarian at best (think HoJo) - and were far exceeded in luxury and comfort by the hampton inn at which we stayed in San Juan. Room service plates sit outside doors all day and into the night. Although the grounds are pretty, the only medium-sized pool does not have a seperate area for adults only (as they do in Barbados) and it is overrun with kids, both on vacation and local kids who presumably belong to Hilton's beach club. There is also no supervision - we literally saw a group of kids screaming profanities at each other and egging on two little girls to hit one another. No one intervened. Towels are hard to find and gone by noon. The one hot tub, which holds 6-8 people, had pineapple rinds both inside and surrounding the tub. The work out facilities, like the hotel, are outdated with only 2 rickety treadmills. All of the Hilton's I stay at for work (52 nights in this past year alone) are superior to this hotel. Luckily, we used points to stay here and although we are disappointed, at least we did not pay hundreds of dollars a night.IF you do stay here, one very bright spot is Nadine, the concierge who is extremely helpful, candid and friendly. Also we had a good meal at La Cava and although expensive, the quality of the food befits the price.","Dec 28, 2007","3","3",2,2,2,3,3,3,5,"4","$227"

The service ranges from OK to mediocre, and the food is very expensive. The rooms are nothing to die for, and the main lobby is way too dark considering the extremely elevated crime rate of the area. If you are driving to the property you'll have to pay a parking fee. The interesting fact is that they have no personnel at the gate because a bunch of crooks assaulted them with shotguns and took all the money from their petty cash (a hotel employee actually told me this fact). So yes, crime will be at your doorstep, so be extremely careful and on the lookout.Some of the hotel staff are nice, but in general they don't make you feel welcome to the place.","Dec 11, 2007","3","3",2,4,4,3,4,3,2,"4","$227"

There are staff members that need to be trained in hospitality and being cordial. They have a little casino which caters mostly to locals and unfortunately theres a lot of nepotism. Customer grievances are handled hap-hazardly and unprofessionally. The wait staff really try to treat customers like family and do a fantastic job. The casino rates players but All I was able to get after 4 days of blackjack at $10 a hand was 4 virgin pina coladas, I took them. The slots are just tight . Since its that nicest hotel in the area I don't have much to choose from. Since my family lives in the area I have to deal with it. If you come here hope for a positve experience but remember youv'e been warned. It's in a isolated spot, there plenty of sun but beach is like volcanic ash. They charged $4.50 for guests to park overnight even thoough I was in the casino playing but locals have parking validated. They charge a $11.90 resort tax and there are no boats, kayaks or beach toys. They have a little gym and restaurants I did not patronize.

"hotel_104","hotel_5504","Excellent retreat This is our third visit to Ponce Hilton. In addition to its excellent staff, Ponce Hilton offers many amenities at a reasonable rate. We walked around the grounds (kept very clean) in the morning and used the fitness center and the pool in the main hotel. We did not have time to use the pool at the Clubhouse, but we highly recommend it to those who prefer a quieter setting. Mosquitoes were not a huge problem. The hotel sprayed at night and kept the grounds free of debris. As for food, we had the continental breakfast and lunch at the hotel. The cold breakfast buffet offers numerous choices including fresh fruit, yogurt, soy, juices, cheeses, cereals, pastries, etc. You have the option of a hot breakfast as well. Ponce Hilton is an excellent choice if you plan to explore historic Ponce and Puerto Rico's southern beaches, forests, and other natural preserves. Before you venture out, make sure to stop at the front desk to confirm travel routes and other important information. We were planning to visit Gilligan's Island during our stay but changed our plans based on the information the consierge obtained from the boat operator when she contacted the company on our behalf.

The hotel and rooms are dated modern.Our room was OK, had a fridge, loved the A/C. Being a Diamond VIP, I had a selection of chocolates and strawberry and a large bottle of Fiji water waiting.The hotel has a casino which doesn't even call my attention. A nicely styled outdoor pool, a poor, ratty fitness center, a so-so beach area (watch out for the undertow) with soft, fine dark sand.All rooms are accessed from the exterior. We were in the executive tower which I guess is supposed to be exclusive.NOW, the very bad part: Perhaps due to the recent rains per a local (Ponce is on the leeward side of the island--drier and hotter) or not, but there was a horrendous mosquito invasion that could not be avoided even in the rooms. Despite heavy chemical spraying, they thrived loving the recessed door and patio areas of each room. Did I mention that Puerto Rico is closely monitoring an outbreak of dengue fever? We and others were running and flailing our arms and towels when going outside the rooms--remember all rooms are accessed from the exterior. It truly was horrible. We slept with the A/C fan on high (very impressive), temp set at 60 degrees with the ceiling fan on high over the bed--we slept with the covers covering our heads all because of the mosquitoes.Not even the free night using points was comforting and I still paid for parking.Nothing great at all.","Nov 8, 2007","3","2",2,3,3,5,3,3,1,"4","$227"

She is by far one of the most helpful persons there. She ensured that our guests got the best accomidations, and catered to their every need. She was also helpful in getting a limo two days before our wedding, and gave wonderful recommendations for local venues.The day of my wedding they allowed me to check into my room in the morning in order to relax and get ready for the chaotic day.

True indeed once you leave the facilities it's not as picturesque as you'd like it to be but in all my travels I've encountered the same experience. I will say that my non Spanish speaking guests were able to get to hotel quickly because it is right off of Highway 2.My husband and I have decided that whenever we go to the enchanted island of Puerto Rico we will have to stay at least one night at the Ponce Hilton. We love it and would recommend the hotel to everyone.","Sep 25, 2007","3","3",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_2426","Best hotel in the area I have stayed at this hotel at least 15 times and finally decided to write a review. This is nicest hotel in the area. Nice pool area . The beach area is nothing to write home about. After you leave the hotel beach area, the walk along the beach to the city park is nothing more than a garbage dump. I have always stayed on business. The executive lounge area room is a great benefit if you are Hilton Honors Gold. Free internet ,free snacks etc. Rooms are above average.The rooms in the Tower are newer but more walking.self parking only 4.50. Be prepared for slow service in the resturant for dinner. I usually go to the bar for a smaller menu and faster service. All the common areas are non smoking.The staff is excellent.Slow service in resturants is typical in Puerto Rico.","Sep 1, 2007","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_3173","I'll be back!!! This past July, we hotel hopped, Stayed in Fajardo, Isla Verde, and Ponce. Staying in Ponce allowed us to visit the central part of the Island (many mountains and incredibly beautiful) wich was only about half hour away. The northern part of Island was about 1 hour away and the West coast 30-45 min drive. We had never stayed at the Hilton, reading the reviews here helped us decide to risk it. Well worth it. Unfortunately, We only spent evenings and mornings there and did not enjoy the facilities enough. The next time down, we will spend more time at the hotel.The rooms were clean, neat and a sort of modern decor. The open lobby invites you to stay and enjoy the ocean breeze. The lower lobby restaurant, seemed to have a formal or semi formal setting, I'll try it next time. Pool was very spacious, many palm trees, and alot of facilities for the kids . Parking is extensive and the casino is entertaining and inexpensive . Staff couldn't be any friendlier. The beach is not good for swimming, but hey, 15-30 min away, you have many beautiful beaches.About 5 minutes south of the hotel is a place called La Guancha they have typical food and music. A beatiufl sunset there (currently my computer's background). The concierge gave us a map of Ponce, we visited downtown. Very historical; the architectural landscape was unbelievable, took some great pictures. People very friendly, a cop on every corner. Ck out the Fire Station, and have an Ice Cream at a store right in front of the fire station.....

Very nice rooms, beautifully landscaped pool area, beach is fair. Good restaurants in Ponce but a little tricky to find your way around downtown. Very nice golf course with 27 holes and very reasonable rates (less than half the golf rates in San Juan).

"hotel_104","hotel_2813","Our 2nd visit We returned to Ponce after a visit perhaps 5-6 years ago. We stayed at the Hilton then and wanted to return. It was pretty much as remembered, though larger now. We really enjoyed the open lobby with the ocean breezes blowing through. Got a bounceback rate which included the breakfast which otherwise was $19/person. The Ponce Hilton is about a 2 hour drive from the San Juan airport. Warning.. PR drivers strongly favor riding along in the left hand lane. The slowest ones in particular migrate over to the left as soon as they can. It makes for maddening driving! Added since our last visit is a 27-hole golf course. They have a shuttle to take you over their bridge to the course. I got a really great rate on Saturday afternoon ---$50 after 2pm with complimentary clubs. Before 2 it would have been $75+$25 for the clubs! Lots of kids around the hotel. They offered free food for kids under 6(?) staying in parent's room. The large number of families seemed to be enjoying the hotel's recreational offerings, etc.Chose not to eat lunch/dinner there, but instead drove over to the restaurant El Ancla which is about a 5-7 min drive along the very industrial water front area. Very good seafood and service. Also wife came up with a 15% discount coupon when she took a tour of Ponce while I was playing golf. For lunch we did the waterfront area adjacent to the Hilton area (and before the industrial area) where there are many, many reasonable choices.","Jul 25, 2007","3","3",5,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_1004","Book NOW! WE LOVED IT! First trip in PR, but not our last! We loved our stay at Ponce Hilton. Stayed 6 nights in Exec. Tower (didn't pay ahead given unknowns, so paid $200 w/ taxes included). During our stay never had a negative experience. Staff was well attentive and helpful. Resort was impeccably maintained, rooms were clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. We had ocean front w/ large balcony, and bistro set, refrigerator in room. Hospitality suite priviledges were WELL WORTH THE EXPENSE! Always well stocked -- 6a-10a continental brkfst foods (only thing missing was meat and eggs, which then moves beyond continental), fruit and cheese during the day, and 5p - 7p hot hors deurves, cheese tray and beverages (juices, sodas, waters and alcoholic included from 5p - 10p! Beer, wine, champagne, hard liquors, mixers ...). Even had desserts and evening liquors from 7p-10p. Saved us a GREAT deal on meals and was ultra convenient. Also had 2 computers and printer for easy internet access. Chose not to bring our laptop, so this was most helpful.When we did dine out, we chose to do so at local places wherever we toured that day. Resort food looked fine, but we can get that at home, so we try to experience local cuisine. Activities on the resort were good for our family (13 yr. old daughter); bikes and bike trails, mini-golf, volleyball, basketball, ping pong, baseball -- all equipment included at no cost and checked out at fitness club. Fitness club was well equipped and clean. Saturday evening they had a 1 hour latin dance demonstration with incredible performers near the buffet area for all to enjoy. Casino is small, but open all hours, and inexpensive table limits -- $1 minumum roulette table -- try finding that in Vegas or Biloxi! They even came around with grilled cheese and ham sandwiches in addition to drinks. On-site club, but my husband's not a dancer, so didn't take advantage of this.As mentioned, no real swimming beach here, but just 30 minute drive from several beautiful ones. 2 pools w/ hot tubs, plus access to golf  country club facilities. Pool got crowded on weekends, so we took hotel shuttle to country club side, and it was much less crowded. Kayaks available for $10 -- unlimited time, with cool little islands to aim for and explore. Snorkeling is decent from the country club side, but better in other areas.We had a car, so we made our excursions and returned to Ponce Hilton at night. Absent changing hotels several times, you'll need to do that wherever you stay given the size and distance between rain forest, beaches and Old San Juan area. Best beach area was Rincon if swimming beaches is what you are after, but several less commercialized ones are within 30 minute drive from Ponce.Diving was great -- we used Paradise Diving in Parguera (45 min. drive from Ponce Hilton). $80 incl. tax for 2 tank dive and snacks. Water is rough, so if you're sea sick prone, take pills ahead of time. Total trip time was about 4.5 hours. (Compare with Hawaii at $170+ for 3 hr trip). We stayed in Condado Beach area 1 night at Comfort Inn to make touring that area easier. Loved Old San Juan, but hated Condado. Recommend Condado area for those 18-26 yrs who essentially go for the partying, and don't consider themselves beach connoseurs. Incredibly crowded driving, and exits are not well marked. Road construction and heavy traffic adds to confusion.Having vacationed in Hawaii often, we continually compared PR with HI. I now prefer PR. From east coast, travel time is far less; crowds are far smaller, and you feel less like a number (other than in Condado/Old San Juan -- where you definitely get the Waikiki welcome to our island, give me your money, and get out of the way so I can deal with the next person treatment). PR is much less expensive than HI, for essentially the same vacation (obvious differences in asian v. latin cultures). Many other side trips our 7 day stay didn't permit time. You must have a car to really enjoy the place, unless you just want a 3 day resort get-away. For that I would recommend Rincon if you want ocean swimming; Ponce Hilton if pool and walking beach is fine for you. WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND VISITING PUERTO RICO. PEOPLE ARE WONDERFUL, PRICES ARE REASONABLE, AND SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","Jul 19, 2007","5","4",6,6,6,6,6,6,5,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_6920","Clean and spotless Our family of 5 stayed here June 6-7. After roughing it for 2 weeks throughout PR and Vieques at relatives bungalows and guest houses, we needed a place with good mattresses, hot water, and cable TV at night. We were pleasantly surprised. The room was spotless and VERY clean. The shower was great. We picked this place because we wanted to enjoy the hotel room and its grounds. We would not be venturing out since we had been out exploring for 2 weeks and just wanted to relax in nice surroundings. (We explored Ponce years ago and that was great too.) We liked the fact that there were no pesky mosquitoes around the grounds. We took the 5 minute shuttle to the golf club pool - it was great too. The only down side was the beach was not a swimming beach. But we were beached out by the time we got there so just having that spectacular oceanview was so peaceful. We had a balcony room. Let me also mention that we arrived at about 7:30 a.m. from western PR and our room was available. Very nice.","Jul 8, 2007","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_1670","Mixed feelings about this Hilton - room noise I stayed at the Hilton in Ponce on a business trip, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights, June 10-12. I had stayed there once previously, also on business.It is a moderately attractive property -- an interesting, airy layout of the lobby and main restaurant lead out to the pool area, and from there to the beach. It's nice to sit in the restaurant and look at the Koi pond, the pool, and the palm trees. The food is OK, if a little expensive (about $38 for a dinner with one beer, including tip. $12 plus tip for the continental breakfast). The breakfast includes a nice variety of fruits, breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, and hot items such as eggs and pancakes.The rooms are nice, and large. The beds are comfortable. My only real complaint about the rooms -- poor sound insulation. One evening, a woman in the room below had a phone conversation, apparently with her balcony door open. The sound bounced off the concrete beams outside and back into my room. Even with my balcony door closed, I could hear (and understand) every word.It is perhaps fortunate that the place does not seem to get very crowded. (Based just on the two times I've been there.) There's never a wait for the restaurant.The beach is small, and sort of unattractive. The pool and surrounding play areas (volleyball, mini-mini-golf, basketball) are nice enough looking (I didn't use them).There's a huge excess of parking, yet they charge $4.50 per day for it ($10 if you valet-park). If you're in the west wing (as I was), the parking is closer than the valet desk, so you'll actually do less walking if you self-park.No HBO or other premium movie channel, but of course you can pay for movies.Some of my colleagues at work are residents of the Ponce area -- some of them grew up there. They say that the central historic area is nice, but that you want to be careful what areas of the town that you travel through.","Jun 16, 2007","1","1",4,4,4,5,5,4,5,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_9510","Will never go back to this hotel This was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. The service is horrible and this is suppose to be a resort?? Tip #1 If you want a glass of water w/ your meal start asking for it early. It took exactly 4 request every time before I got one. 4 is the magic number. TIP #2 Prepare to have both of your room keys fail. Make sure you take both of them at all times because god forbid you get stuck outside of your room ...oh say about 12:00 at night because they will take thirty three minutes to send someone up to let you in. TIP#3 This is important. DO NOT plan on getting a buzz from any of the drinks mixed at the bars. Even though it appears that they are pour liquer into the drink take my advice and my 174.00 tab and go to the liquer store located just outside the guard gate (they will be more than happy to tell you where it is) and buy a bottle. Then purchase virgin drinks and add your own liquer. DO NOT expect to get good food here either and it is not inexpensive. Oh TIP#4 This one is for the women. If you are American be prepared. Apparently Puerto Rican women do not like American women EVEN THOUGH Puerto Rico is part of the United States. They treated my friend and I horrible. Tip#5 Unless you are from Manhattan or Tampa Bay you might just want to take a defensive driving course or get a prescription for Zanex. If you have never been to P.R you are instore for some of the worst drivers in the country. There are no white lines in the road. Yes that is right no lines therefore they are ALL OVER the place. I will never complain about New York drivers ever again. TIP#6 The final one. If you would like to blend in with the other drivers simply lay on the horn and just blow on through the red light or stop sign. Make sure your music is blarring so you can't hear anybody elses horns and you will be fine. BTW there is no service out on the beach so DO NOT EXPECT resort style service. This resort had more children in it than the Disney resorts. My advice is stay in San Juan there was much more to do and it is much more beautiful.

"hotel_104","hotel_7269","We liked it for the most part. We stayed at the Hilton in Ponce, Puerto Rico, which I am about to review. However, first I think it would be helpful to say a few words about Puerto Rico in general and Ponce in particular. We visited Puerto Rico many years ago. In those days, Puerto Rico was very poor and frankly depressing. We chanced a trip back to San Juan about a year ago. I couldn't believe the difference. We have traveled extensively in Latin America 鈥?our most recent trip being to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, where they definitely don't have their act together. Puerto Rico is a clean, prosperous and safe place to visit. It is heads and shoulders above anywhere else in Latin America we have ever visited. In Puerto Rico everything works 鈥?click, click, click. It is the only place in Latin America I know about where you can drink the tap water and eat the vegetables wihtout wishing you hadn't. You can trust the police. Bribes are not the tradition there. They use American money. Very good English is widely spoken. There were many times I could not hear a trace of an accent. It seems like nearly everyone drives a late model car. Both times we visited there, the weather was perfect 鈥?low eighties in the middle of the winter. I saw no beggars on the street. American stores and restaurants are everywhere. You don't need a passport to get there. Our Sprint cell phones had free roaming there 鈥?I can't tell you what a convenience that was. We could call each other when separated and our teenager when she wandered off. We could call businesses and have them tell us how to get there. Our teenager sat out on the balcony and talked to her friends back in the United States for hours.We liked our stay in San Juan a lot during our last visit. We stayed in the Hilton there as well, which we also liked a lot. We decided to go to Ponce and stay there for four days just to see something different. There were three of us 鈥?two adults and a teenager. The only hitch we ran into is that we had booked a connecting flight from San Juan to Ponce on Cape Air with CheepoAir.com. We had an itinerary from CheepoAir that said we were booked on that flight. Cape Air stated that CheepoAir had canceled our flights 鈥?something never mentioned to us and something we certainaly never ordered or agreed to. However, Cape Air said they could get us on that flight, but it would cost a lot, lot more than the advance purchase fare we had booked. I don't know who made the mistake, but I do tend to get little a suspicious of profitable errors. Anyway, it worked out just great. We declined and walked right down to Hertz. The rental for the car for four days, including tax, was $148, which was much less than the original air fare for the connecting flight for one person, let alone three. Except for a short stretch in San Juan, it was all turnpike (about $6 in tolls each way) and a lovely drive through rolling hills. It took less than an hour and a half. We arrived before our scheduled three hour layover in San Juan was over and we had the use of the car while we were in Ponce. The total gas cost was $28 for the round trip and our running around in Ponce. The hotel charged something like $5 a day to park there.Now to the Hilton Ponce. The bottom line is that we liked it. We stayed in a part of the hotel called the Executive Tower. You get a substantial discount on the room rate if you pay in full in advance, which we did. The room was spacious and clean. There were two double beds in the room. I wouldn't call the beds roomy, but they were adequate. We had a balcony that looked out on the ocean. There was a desk in the room. They wanted nearly ten dollars a day for a high speed internet connection. They had an Executive Center where you could get a free wireless connection. Swiping my room card at the door to get in would not work there, but the people on duty always quickly buzzed me in with a smile. The last evening I was there, however, the lady on duty told me that I had to be a Hilton VIP member to use that room. There was nothing on the door to that effect and I saw no mention of that in the guest guide in the room. While that rubbed me more than a little wrong, I have to say the lady was very apologetic and nice about it.The grounds were beautifully landscaped. However, Ponce is not a beach destination. The hotel did have a narrow beach, which did not have a life guard and suffered from some liter. The pool is very nice. The food, while a bit pricy, was outstanding. You can figure on about $35 a person for supper, after taxes, but before tip and about $25 a person for lunch. I don't think Ponce is famous for its restaurants. We ate at several guide book recommended restaurants in Ponce. They were okay, but the food at the Hilton had us spoiled.Most service personnel spoke English very well and they were very polite. Twice the maid forgot to leave coffee for the coffee maker in our room, but both times I called the front desk and a clerk showed up at our door almost at once with the coffee packs. Once the toilet stopped up. I called the front desk and a guy showed up in a flash to fix it. Everyone went out of their way to be friendly. Plenty of security. There are uniformed security guards wandering around all the time.Ponce has a nice little square downtown, surrounded by nice shops. It's hard to find a place to park there. I had to park the car a couple of blocks away and walk, but that wasn't much of a problem. They have some sort of a shuttle bus there to get around the downtown area, but we didn't use it. There is also a nice boardwalk along a harbor with several local restaurants close to the hotel. It's a nice place to go for a stroll, especially at night. We ate at one of the restaurants on the boardwalk, but it did not impress us. Ponce is a nice. well kept little town, but you run out of things to see pretty fast. It's worth a few trips into town, but we spent most of our time at the Hilton, where there is plenty to do.We arrived back to San Juan in our rental car hours before our mid-afternoon flight. We drove out to a part of San Juan called Condado for a leisurely lunch, which we enjoyed immensely. Condado is a tourist area in San Juan close to Old Town that has quite few really nice restaurants. It sure beats air port food, if you have the time and a car to get there.In short, I highly recommend Puerto Rico, Ponce, the Ponce Hilton and Condado in San Juan. I also recommend that you rent a car to drive to Ponce rather than taking a connecting flight.","Feb 21, 2007","11","8",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_8749","Great weekend getaway Perfect vacation for the rejuvenating effect. We decided to take a weekend off and go to the carribean. We had been to San Juan last year and thought ah it was ok. Ponce on the other hand, well at least this resort was very good. The only reason I dont give them an excellent was because of the first impression I got from the staff. The person that checked us in wasn't to helpful, granted we checked in at about 5:30am but he could of been friendlier. Other than that two thumbs up, the grounds of the resort are kept very well. Everything was clean lawns where manicured small beach but nice. Casino on the location is mainly slot machines but have 2 craps tables 2 roulette tables 1 black jack table 1 carribean poker table and 2 texa's hold'em tables. The locals are regulars in this casino they seem to be of the retired age and have nothing better to do than burn through their money. The cost of things are U.S. prices, its not like traveling to D.R. where you'll get more for your dollar. Food is expensive in the hotel. $22 dollars lunch buffet and $30 dollars dinner buffet. There's this one seafood restaurant Pito's Seafood restaurant, food was good there service was ok we went there after a drive thru town. The golf area was very nicely kept they actually have residences on the grounds of the course its a 27 hole PGA course, which probably means they get funds from PGA to keep the place that clean.Quick tricks for you if you do decide to go for a short stay1- Pack light take carryon luggage only2- Rent a car even if its for 2 days its worth going out into town and looking around. Get the economy size car its cheap and it'll be enough to get you around.3- Fork over the extra 30 bucks to stay in the executive rooms, this will give you acces to the executive lounge which includes a free continental breakfast and free drinks (non-alcoholic) and snacks throughout the day. Plus you get free internet access and you could check in and print your boarding pass when you are ready to leave.4- Check out the pier right by the hotel lots of food kiosks for eating typical greasy puerto rican foodOverall good fun","Feb 12, 2007","1","0",5,6,6,6,4,6,6,"4","$227"

There are more than enough pool and beach chairs to go around and there are tennis courts and other activities for the guest who wants to be active. The beach is not the greatest because it is quite stony, but if you can get by this, it is a great place to stay.

The adjacent Caribe golf course is a newer 27-hole track with 2 holes oceanside (#18  #27) relatively flat, and unchallenging, unless the winds are up. If you don't want to venture out for dinner the Italian restaurant at the golf clubhouse is your best option (tip: plus the pool there, while smaller, is nicer and less crowded).","Dec 5, 2006","0","0",5,6,5,6,6,6,5,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_1890","Nice Resort I just returned from a 3 day trip to Ponce, staying at the Hilton. After reading some of the reveiws here, I was a little nervous but I ended up pleasantly surprised. We arrived at 7 AM and our room was not immediately ready, so we sat down there for breakfast. In the middle of breakfast, the receptionist came to our table to tell us our room was ready. I thought this to be great service. Another receptionist happily gave us perfect directions to a restauraunt in Ponce. If you are looking for a beach resort, this may not be the place, but for that matter I don't think anywhere in Ponce has nice beaches. The beach was nice enough to walk out there in the morning, put your feet in the water, enjoy the view, then go sit by the pool. The pool here is very nice. I sat there all day long with very easy access to tropical drinks. The hotel is open air, so you get a nice breeze whenever in the lobby and main restauraunt. The buffet was a little expensive ($22 for the lunch and $18 for breakfast), but there was plenty of options. If you are there around noon on a Friday, be sure to check out the fashion show...very awkwardly entertaining. The hotel was very clean. And the casino was reasonable. $5 blackjack and craps, $1 roullette. We rented a car and used there self parking, which was $4.50 a day. I thought it was a little crazy to charge for parking, but the $4.50 was better than the $10 for valet. Unless you are extremely lazy, there is no need for valet...the parking lot is right in front of the hotel. If I ever go back to Ponce, I will stay at the Hilton. But next time I'd be sure to bring my sticks in order to check out their golf course.","Nov 13, 2006","2","2",4,4,5,6,6,6,4,"4","$227"

The beach hotel's not is the very good but you can go the Saturdays or the Sundays to Caja de Muerto Island from La Guancha that is very near to the hotel. The beaches of Caja muerto Island is excellent you can see some colors fish, seagul and different birds and plants. The Island has a litter museum, bathroom facilities, a historical ligth house and beautiful views. Is important that if you are thinking to go to Caja de Muerto Island buy your own food in walmart or some place because the island dont have place to buy it; and you have to return your trash to PR . And If you stay in the hotel monday to friday you can go in a car rent to others beautiful beaches near to Ponce as Guanica and Lajas town; but I recommend the beautiful beaches of Rincon, Aguadilla and Isabela towns (it are located in the west of PR 1 hour from POnce) and in the north the beautiful beach of Isla verde in Carolina City, but the better beach in Puerto Rico are located in Culebra and Fajardo Island in the east.

Ponce has La guancha a tourist place, many restaurants, a histoy town , the secound mall more bigger of Puerto Rico and the caribbean and many many places for baby boomers and adults. Puerto Rico is a island 100x 35 miles and you can rent a car and would cross the island and stay in differents hotels I recommend Copamarina beach resortin Guanica for honey moon, Hilton in POnce for all family, The westin Rio Mar Beach golf resort and spa in Rio Grande, the beautiful Conquistador hotel in fajardo, In san Juan El Convento (is one of the best 100 hotel in the world according to Vanidades magazing), Intercontinental, whytham, and for people VIP or high class the ritz carton and Paradissus of Puerto Rico (if you are traveled to PR in other seasons). So come to PR .... For more information visit: (--)","Sep 4, 2006","8","4",5,6,6,6,6,5,6,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_8365","Okay But If You Want a Nice Beach This Is Not It. I booked Hotel on Priceline. We got the room for $122.00 not bad for a resort. We normally stay in isla verde right next to San Juan. My family is near Maniti, Puerto Rico. This time we wanted to try something different. We were told ponce is beautiful. Let me say dont even bother checking out ponce waste of time. Very dry like dessert and dirty. The beach at the Hilton is horrible. We were told beach is black because the rivers empty out into that area. Very ugly beach. The resort is nice. Basketball, ping pong, tennis, nice pool, food on resort very expensive I guess thats why the Hiltons have money and I dont. Also after you pay for room. When you arrive and than check out you have on your bill $7.00 a day resort fee, $4.50 a day for parking or $10.00 a day for valet parking not including tips. And $9.95 a day if you want internet access. So it adds up pretty quickly. Overall nice Hotel. I would stay again but since its in ponce I guess that wont happen.","Aug 18, 2006","8","8",4,5,3,5,4,5,4,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_1475","Can't wait to go back We stayed at the Ponce Hilton for 3 nights. I have no complaints regarding the property. The check-in process was flawless and the room was nice and clean. The first night we went to the boardwalk to eat. The drive took only 5 minutes. The next day we went to the town center for a tour, that was only a 10-15 minute drive away. Everything was very close with a rental car and the resort is nice enough to relax onsite during your entire stay. The food is pricey of course, but that's what you should expect at a resort. We never had to walk from the parking area to the hotel, since they always had a person waiting with a golf cart to give us a ride. We enjoyed the live music on Saturday and the quietness on Sunday. The beach isn't the best but we didn't spend time there anyway. Also be sure to take advantage of the (free) bicycles to tour the property and the 2 basketball courts for exercise. The gym was small but sufficient for vacation needs. We wouldn't hesistate to stay again.","Jul 19, 2006","7","7",6,5,6,5,6,5,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_9929","Great trip - relaxing, affordable and accommodating. Stayed six days at the Ponce Hilton Golf and Beach Resort. We booked (wife+2 children) our travel through Jet Blue out of JFK. First off, the hotel is not opulent but nor is it moderate. It is a resort that offers many amenities.The hotel is sizable and will expand for time share purposes. The parking lot is massive. The hotel has a 1,200 seat convention center, but, as a vacationer, the hotel was never crowded. We stayed in the Executive Tower 5th floor. Great view! The ocean is 200 yards away. Wonderful way to wake up too.The room is spacious. Excellent shower with a big overhead shower head. Cable TV (with all the popular channels ESPN+ESPN2, too). Casino is small, but in Puerto Rico it's one of the largest. Features all the games - blackjack, roulette, craps, slots and, yes, poker (Texas Hold 'em).I have never been to Puerto Rico so I didn't know what to expect from the weather. During our stay the weather was amazing. No clouds, no humidity and 87 degrees.The landscape is well maintained. Palm trees everywhere. The hotel pool is shaped liked a clover leaf - spacious. On the weekends the poolside gets active with a lot of mainlanders who pop in for Saturdays and Sundays. But, Monday-Friday it's quiet and peaceful. The pool also offers a jacuzzi.As well as the pool, there are 4 tennis courts, a bike trail, 2 basketball courts, mini golf, and a play-scape. The hotel beach is not as bad as what has been written. I grew up in So Cal where the water is contaminated, but that doesn't stop anyone from diving in. The hotel beach is small. It's black sand so the water is not sky blue. The water is warm but the downfall is that it has a lot of seaweed growing from the sand. My kids played for hours on the beach with no issues. The remaining strip of beach is not owned by the hotel and is littered, but most beaches are not meticiously maintained, it's not the hotels problem.The hotel offers a shuttle to the golf resort which takes less than 5 minutes to get to. I found that the golf resorts' beach was much better than the hotel's. Plus the swimming pool there is excellent too. I didn't golf. There are 27 holes to play on. The golf resort has villas for sale starting at 600k. That should be a reminder to all that the resort has a high-end commitment.The food is a little pricey. But most places when you go somewhere tropical are generally expensive. What was nice, since we had kids, was that the morning buffet was free to children. They chowed and we did too. We didn't have a bad meal on site. The only time we left the resort was to eat out one time - Pito's Seafood.  If you want to go to Hawaii and spend twice as much money for a better beach then do so. If you want to go to Vegas and gamble at huge casinos then do that. I work. My wife works. We wanted to go some place that we had never been to and do nothing except soak up some sun, swim in the pool, go to the beach and relax. This hotel did just that for us.","Apr 24, 2006","13","13",5,5,1,6,1,4,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_3641","Ponce Hilton- not all it's cracked up to be!!!! In February,my husband and I decided to visit his family in Ponce,PR.They told us that this was the best hotel in Ponce. Now,I read all of the reviews on the hotel from trip advisor and was quite leary to stay at the Hilton,but we did any way. First we live in New Jersey, so the only flights to Ponce left at 11pm and arrive at 4:45am- realize the two airlines that go in and out of the airport were Jet Blue and Continental. Both flights arrive at the same time - so 500 people are at the luggage carosel picking up luggge. Next, try picking up you rental car when 300 people are in line to pick up their cars and the agencies don't open till 5:30AM- Disaster to START!!! Finally got the car, off to the Hilton (WE VISITED FAMILY FIRST). I booked my hotel reservations through AAA and booked an excutive tower room. Executive tower rooms have entrance to the executive lounge: this is where you can get food,drinks etc.. as part of the price of the room)And if anyone knows food in PR is expensive. I also called the hotel to confirm all of this! Up to the desk and I check in. What does the front deck do- tries to put me in an executive tower room without access to the lounge they said because of the priceI paid for the room I said that's what you and AAA contracted for and that is not what I paid for! I got my paper work and I showed them that it clearly stated ALL executive tower rooms have entrance to the lounge- they saw it my way and put me in the room I wanted and entrance to the lounge. We also go 2 free drinks in the casino,I had to ask for that too, but I got out tickets. About the room, nice view, bathroom spacious. Fridge in room- what a plus! Executive lounge food okay worth the extra money since dinner was about $20-25 for an entree. Careful,my coffee makes blewup.I got a new one. The pool was good, but the beach disgusting. I am a beach person, I have traveled all over, including Hawaii 7 times. I know my beaches-What Hilton did was to comb or clean the beach right up to where the hotel ended, but the beach contined say a mile or so. After the hotel there was junk all over the beach- oil cans,glass, shoes,plastic and fish nets- GROSS!! You see there are no other hotels around so there's no excuse for a dirty beach! The seems to be lack of pride in the land of PR. You know,Hawaii is similar to PR- landscape wise. But Hawiians have a great pride in their land and unfortunately those living in PR do not- that's the difference.The city of Ponce has it's good parts and bad! Watch out for the drivers- CRAZY NO BLINKERS. My husband lived in Ponce for 4 years while growing up and he was shocked at how different it was. He wanted me to tell you all if you are going to Ponce, watch out about getting ripped off- they tried in resturants and stores, but did not work with us . We don't look like tourists so I don't get it!!Here's the best- It was Sunday night and my husband and I wanted to eat on property. So there is a sushi place(Sancho's) by the golf course and you'd can be taken there by golf cart. So we asked at the front desk, yes, they are open go the valet are they will take you. We got dressed went to the lounge for a drink- asked in the lounge is Sancho's open? yes and same story. We went to the valet- We were told-NO sorry, they're are not open until Tuesday. Also, the nice resturant was closed too!! so we had to go out to eat. I have to say lack of communication among to staff is evident to say the least- this ia a Hilton for Gos sake's, the hotel claims to be a resort,but the are not by any means. Do you know when I checked in I asked for a map of the hotel-No such thing I had to discover everything myself. Supposedly Ponce is building a port for cruise ships-If Ponce and the hotel continues on this course of poor treatment of travelers they will not get the repeat tourism they need. I just think that PR does not get it! Tourism creates jobs, jobs create money. Happy travelers- you will tell others. Bad trip you'll tell the world!!!!","Apr 18, 2006","26","13",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_3783","Not rally a great experience! I stayed here mostly so my husband could use the Casino. The staff was friendly but the prices they charge for food, etc. very expensive - it is really for business people on an expense account. Breakfast started at $10. and dinner was ridiculous. They pretty much know they have you captured. Did go into Ponce but did not really feel safe and thank god we were only here for 2 nights because beside the fire station there is really nothing to see.Pool was smaller than it appeared in pictures and the beach was nothing to write home about. We would not stay here again. If you have any questions i would be happy to answer them.","Mar 30, 2006","8","4",4,4,1,4,1,4,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_4282","A Real Disappointment My husband and I just returned from a week in Puerto Rico as our honeymoon. Most of the week was spent in BB's and forest accommodations. However, we wanted to have some luxury for the last two nights, so we booked the Hilton in Ponce as a Resort and Spa. What a disappointment! While everyone who worked there was unfailingly pleasant and did their absolute best to make our stay good, management decisions made it a bore and seriously uncomfortable in some ways.WE did our homework--read Tripadvisor and Fodor's and everything Hilton said about the place. Nowhere did anyone say that almost everything in the place was closed on Sunday and the spa is closed on Monday. The only place to get anything to eat at the hotel on Sunday is a restaurant outdoors--hot, with cigarette smoke and mosquitoes. The same is true for breakfast. I was bitten several times during breakfast on the second morning, and all the poor woman working the desk could offer was repellant. Obviously, they know they have a problem. Why not correct it?We wanted to use the spa, but it was closed. No one suggested the spa at the completely separate golf villas. We found out about it online after we got home. The beach bar never opened while we were there, and neither did the bar upstairs. No attendant ever showed up at the booth on the beach the whole time we were there. There was truly nothing to do except sit by the ocean or the underfilled pool or waste money in a very dirty, smoky, tiny casino. We arrived fully ready to be happy, but this place is no resort and for us it was no spa. Golf, maybe. We don't play. By the way, the expansive shopping arcade described in Fodor's is one tiny store--besides the equally tiny minimart elsewhere on the property. Everything else has been reduced to meeting rooms. Obviously, this place haas been reduced to a business location. They should make that clear so others won't waste their limited time and resources the way we did.","Mar 2, 2006","11","9",4,5,1,5,1,6,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_5030","Mixed experience at the Hilton Ponce The Hilton Ponce was nice but nothing special. My husband and I stayed here one night after two nights at the Hotel Melia (downtown Ponce). We stayed downtown as our base for visiting the city and driving around the island (went through the mountains to Arecibo and everywhere in between). We came to the Hilton for a day of pool and sun, and it was just okay.They call the Hilton Ponce a resort, and I guess that just depends on your impression of what a resort should be. Perhaps I am spoiled by the excellent service I get in Cancun, but the Hilton Ponce offered decent service, but very understated. I would say it was very American in its attitude. People were polite, but not going out of their way to make that extra effort.Here is an example: I called to book massages at the spa two full weeks in advance because I knew the hotel was supposed to be fully booked and I didn't want to chance it. I called that afternoon to re-confirm our appointment times and nobody answered the phone at the spa. I had specifically asked for the last two appointments of the day so that we could take advantage of the sun and pool, so I thought, no big deal, I'll just call the front desk and ask what time the spa closes. So I call the front desk, and the lady doesn't know the answer to my question. She puts me on hold and after a couple minutes comes back to tell me that the spa is closed on Mondays. Well, that's funny because I was SURE I booked it for February 20, a Monday. My husband started waving a brochure in front of me, which explains there is a huge spa at the Golf Course next to the hotel. So I ask the front desk lady, is it possible that my massage was booked at the Golf course spa? She has no clue what I was talking about. She did not apologize, simply transferred me to the golf course. Turns out there is NO full service spa at the Golf course, but they do give massages over there, and anyway, they lost my spa reservation. I thought the whole thing should have been handled better and they should have been at least apologetic. Instead they seemed clueless.Aside from that experience, the resort was nice, but really not amazing. Definitely needs some updating, like chipping paint, that kind of thing. The beach is really small here and I've since learned that this side of Puerto Rico does not have great beaches. The pool is smallish and chilly and there were lots of kids there. We learned a little too late that there is a really nice pool over by the Golf shop, which we wished we had found that morning. It seemed much quieter over there. Also, the rooms over there seemed really really nice, but I wonder if they are part of a time-share, as the area was called Costa Caribe. I would probably go back there if I planned a trip to Ponce, but only if I got a really great rate. The drinks at the pool bar are expensive, especially if you have been elsewhere in Puerto Rico, which is generally dirt cheap. The dinner with salad bar/soup/dessert was about $30 and gave extremely big portions. The quality was mediocre though.My husband and I (who never gamble) decided to poke into the casino just to check it out. We couldn't stay in there more than 10 seconds because it was smoky and gross. It's not so much the smell of fresh smoke that is bothersome, but the smell of years of smoke that has penetrated the carpets and everything in the room that is just putrid. Even if I were a gambler and a smoker I would take a pass on this casino.","Feb 23, 2006","10","7",4,4,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_8392","Relaxing,and Pretty! I really enjoyed this hotel.I mean it was nothing so special, but it was just low-key and relaxing. The lobby was open and airy, the pool area had so many palm trees, it wasn't too crowded so we were really able to have our own spot.I accidentally dropped my necklace between the deck. I mentioned it the waiter and told him it wasn't a big deal it was my own fault or wearing a necklace to the pool. But within 10 minutes there were 2 guys taking the deck apart.Quick and efficient. The rooms weren't too bad either. They could be updated a little. But they were clean, smelled good,were open and airy. We had one of the best rooms in my opinion. Make sure to get the ground floor, we had room 131. It is great because our sliders opened up right to an awesome view if the Carribean, with the pool to our right. Free breakfast, good selection. Free entrance to the clubs on premises, fun Salsa dancing.The sports bar by the pool has a decent burger and chicken ceaser salad too.

"hotel_104","hotel_10063","Very nice resort and golf course We flew into San Juan and rented a car from Payless . they forced me to take CDW even though I showed them my NYS insurance card. (Check this out with your car co.)We drove to Ponce 1.5 hour pleasant drive thru mountains.I played 3 rounds of golf. The course is attractive and interesting but not memorable. No problem for a bogy golfer if you can stay out of the ponds. Holes #9 ,18 and 27 end on the ocean otherwise there are no other oceanviews.Food was not great . Sat night was an excellent pig roast with local specialties. Other buffet meals were not up to par.But if you are a big eater you will get your moneys worth.Wine list was expensive starting at $44. But if asked they offered a decent 'off the list wine' for $27Our best meal was 'Marks at the Melia' in Ponce. We went there once but if we had more time we would have gone back more.'Pitos' on the ocean wes also great for lunch. you can drive to Pitos,otherwise take a cab into the Ponce area unless you like to drive around lost and clueless in seedy enviorns.We drove to the famous Rain forest . Not worth the 5+ hour round trip in NYC style traffic. Shoud be OK from San Juan.Overall I agree with the positive reviews here.","Feb 9, 2006","5","4",5,5,1,5,1,5,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_10279","Christmas week at Hilton/Ponce, PR Just returned from Christmas mid-week stay at Hilton in Ponce. Was a little concerned after reading some of these reviews, and of course, we had already booked the place through Jetblue getaways for a great price. So here we go...Husband and I had been to PR many times with teen daughter, mostly staying in and around San Juan. Took the only flight Jetblue from NY has to Ponce night after Christmas, arriving at 4:30 AM. Short cab ride to Hilton, one person working reception desk. Very pleasent. We upgraded to 2 br suite w/ magnificent deck. Husband crashed immediately, whilst daughter and I went exploring in the dark.(Very secure, cameras and security folks everywhere) Place was beautifully decorated for Christmas, lots of lights and flowers. Everyone we met from hotel were friendly and welcoming. I was plesently suprised by the beach area. Yes it is gated and locked at night and the black sand is unexpected for the Carribian. The beach itself was about a 1/2 mile cresent, perfect for walking, finding shells and beach glass. Padded lounge chairs a nice treat. Waiter service on beach always a plus to me. Spent each day lounging, as the reason we were there was to RELAX. The water was clear and warmer than the pool, with lots of folks swimming. I recommend water shoes to get past the rocks. No snorkeling but also no hawkers, hair braiders, jet ski noise, para sailers, banana boat rides, just quiet. No other resorts or hotels in sight. Big difference from Isla Verde, Condodo, etc. I would have liked to see kayaks or cats for use, but the quiet was worth the trade off. The place offered nothing for teens by day or night. There was a playground and mini golf for the younger crowd. There was also an arcade/pool table area in the rear of the lobby, played air hockey with daughter a couple of times before dinner. Forgot to mention, bikes are available for free from fitness center, good for touring the grounds. The grounds and public areas never seemed crowded even during this holiday week. The spa is miniscule and workers may leave you at the manicure table to answer phones, and make appointments. No massage tables outside. Better off going to a day spa near home. The food and drink prices were high as expected. The best meal of the week came from room service (salmon done perfectly, Steak tender). On lobster night,($36) they ran out of lobster after we ordered about 8 pm. so we were out of luck there, and no round of drinks to compensate. We tried the Japanese place by shuttle to Golf area. The wait was intermidable, the fish fresh and presentation was ok. The waiter came over every half hour or so to tell us our food would be right out, but we were seated for about two hours before the appetizer came! There was a pack of kids running through the place screaming which didn't help matters much. Again, a round a drinks or complimenty desert would have been appropriate balm to our frazzeld patience. This place would not last 10 minutes anywhere else. Back at the main hotel, we complained to front staff, the next day half the food price was removed from our bill, so the right thing was done there. Our rooms were clean, pretty, and large. Absolutely no complaints there. Husband and I went to casino three nights, lots of locals playing with lots of money. Joined the Hilton players club, rec'd no perks but walked away ahead so that was ok. The dealers seemed to know the regulars, but I didn't perceive any snobbishness towards the Americans. Drinks were hard to come by, had to ask the dealer who told the pit boss to send a waitress over. Do that as soon as you sit down so you get a drink w/in first hour of play. I actually gave up waiting and went to the adjoing bar to purchase a drink one night. Also, consider joining Executive lounge, the continental breakfast and delicious cafe con leche well worth the daily price os $30 per room. On last night we requested wake up call for 3:30 am., and set alarm, thank goodness, because wake up call never came. Check out was easy, but not enough cabs back to airport. We were getting nervous about our 6:00am departure as we found ourselves still waiting in front of hotel at 5:00am. People behind us were really upset, we attempted to get the manager to release the Hilton van to shuttle us. No go. We did make it on time. The airport is tiny and has only one screening area so we were divided on lines for Jetblue and Continental. Also were assured plane would not depart until everyone got through. Would I go back? Yes. But not with teen daughter. Perfect for couples on a long weekend, I would probably become bored after 5 days without something else to do. We are used to stepping out of our hotel for great inexpensive local foods and drinks. That was not an option here. There was nothing around the place, so be guided accordingly. If however, you are seeking the quiet, very sunnyside of P.R. the Hilton is a great choice. We were content and got what we came for: sun, beach, warmth, and clean beautiful accomadations.","Jan 3, 2006","24","23",5,6,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_2386","Good Hotel Spent a week at the Hilton just after Easter this year. The visitors were a pleasant mix of vactioners / business travellers and English / Spanish speaking. The hotel was impeccably well maintained and professionally managed and staffed. I stayed in the Executive Tower and had concierge lounge access. My room was clean, large and nicely but not creatively furnished. Marble bathroom was large and again very clean.The concierge lounge is located on the ground floor. It offers standard continental breakfast fare, canapes at cocktail hour and sweets later. The lounge is air-conditioned and well appointed. Free internet access is offered as well. The lounge was mostly staffed by enthusiastic and friendly students from one of the local universities. They were unfaillingly polite, but their youth and limited llife experience curtailed their usefullness. Inquiries about hiring tour guides, contacting realtors, even eating out were fielded without much success.To me the beach looked nice enough. Good maybe for a walk or sunning. Because of the dark sand, the water does not have that quintessential gin clear look found on some other islands. I did not swim in the sea because either all the beach chairs were taken, or it was too windy. There were many appealling and quiet places between the beach and busy pool to take in some sun and read. Restaurant / bar service was offered in all such areas.The restaurants were all well run and staffed though the menus are more Hilton North American standard than local. Fish was not prominently featured, though I did have what might have been the finest lamb chops I've had in quite some time. The restaurant at the adjacent golf club (a shuttle will pick you up) is truly outstanding. I ate there my final night and would have gone more often had I discovered it sooner. They are supposedly an Italian influenced restaurant, however, on the night I was there, they only offered a limited menu (I don't remember why). I had delicious mahi mahi with a tomatillo cilantro sauce and fried plantains.","May 8, 2005","13","11",5,5,1,5,1,6,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_4672","Great hotel, but the beach is terrible! We just returned from half a week in PR. Spent a couple of days in Ponce Hilton in an amazing ocean-facing room in the north tower - with the sound of the waves. The room was large and the King size bed was really comfy but the bathroom could have been better. The floor tiles are in desperate need of a strong bleach!!The hotel has a nice disco - called BOHEMIA that plays some peppy latino music and a casino (where we lost some money). The restaurants serve decent food and the bar (which is open till 1.00 a.m.)has the most amazing pina colada I've ever had.The pool-side, the jacuzzi and the lawns are well-maintained and, pool towels are free. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and will help you with directions and sight-seeing. However, the beach at the hotel is really terrible - full of pebbles and stones and rocks - DO NOT TRY to take off your footwear there!We went to La Paraguera, a tiny fishing village (an hour's drive from the hotel ). It has facilities for snorkeling and a beautiful bioluminencent bay where we swam in the enchanted waters.......no trip to Puerto Rico is complete without this experience. It's like being in a magical kingdom, surrounded by star-dust mixed with the water. TIP: 1. Do wear a wet suit to avoid feeling cold.2. Do not give up the opportunity to swim in the enchanted waters if you feel scared of jumping into dark waters. WEAR A LIFE JACKET!","Apr 5, 2005","19","17",3,5,1,4,1,4,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_3659","Nice Hotel, only decent beach We stayed for 3 nights/4 days in March (10th-14th). Ponce is a small area carved out between industrial plants. It is not very attractive.Getting to the hotel was interesting--driving in San Juan you honestly take your life into your hands. Drive was beautiful once you are out of SJ. The hotel was very nice--solid 3.5 star. The 'black sand' beach was more 'grey' and the water continually cloudy, with large (unseen) rocks that you'd crack your feet on. Walking down the beach, the water got much clearer, however the beach was littered with a LOT of trash. The last day we were there, we were approached by a local who stated the water was polluted by industrial waste (as we were swimming there) and that beach robberies of Americans was very common away from the resort.Food at the hotel was very good--the upper scale restaurant was superb. The employees of the hotel were always friendly and helpful. Rooms were spacious and clean, and had nice fridge's. Pool was nice, but FILLED with loud kids.If you go to Ponce, plan to eat fast food. We could not find ONE restaurant in Ponce Proper other than the little place on the water that had seafood. We did discover why PR is the FF capital of the world! If you are looking for authentic PR food, you probably wont find it in Ponce. We were also given the 'stink eye' everywhere we went outside of the resort. We did not see many non-locals out looking about. Our trip to the 'boardwalk' was interesting to say the least. Ponce locals do not seem to be too thrilled with tourists.Based on our observations, crime is rampant in PR, so we were extra careful about leaving possessions in the rental cars. Most houses have iron gates over balcony's and doors, and any decent car has large lojack signs in the windows. I will definately not visit this side of the island again. We were looking for an area that was not hugely 'touristy', but was at least friendly and nice looking. Ponce was dirty and a little bit scary. it was, however, pretty easy to navigate once you got the hang of it.","Mar 24, 2005","25","17",4,5,1,5,1,5,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_1385","Very Relaxing Our family has just returned from 5 days at the Ponce Hilton and we were very pleased! I am sorry the reviewer from Oregon felt so uncomfortable there, we felt the exact opposite and we are white mainlanders with 2 small children! The staff was always friendly and more than helpful. The comment about the service by the pool is half accurate - you place your order at the bar and the waitstaff delivers it to you by the pool. We even had waitstaff return to see if we needed anything else.I agree with other comments about the food being expensive, but it is good and there is a good variety and you can eat just about whatever you want, whenever you want. Our last night we went to La Cava and our 5 year old daughter wanted pancakes and our son wanted pasta with marinara sauce and they were more than happy to accommodate. The restaurants were so friendly and generous, I think we paid for a total of 3 meals for the kids and we ate every meal on the property. The kids even got gifts and free ice cream, they loved it!The surrounding town is not that exciting. This is definately a place to stay on the property and relax.The fitness center, although small, is great! They have just about every piece of equipment you need for a great workout! There are also bikes to ride on a great walking/riding path around the perimeter of the property. I walked every morning and it was so nice to be outside in the perfect weather!!We found the pool great and very clean. All kinds of floating toys, chairs and volleyball for play at the pool's volleyball net. The hotel added a basketball hoop the last day we were there - all the kids at the hotel played together - it was fun!The beach was a bit disappointing in that it is shelly and it was very windy. We found a nice sandy spot to the left and enjoyed the warm waters.There are lots to do for kids of all ages. There is a basketball half court, 2 volleyball courts, table tennis, playgrounds for toddlers and older kids, a small rock wall and lots of beach toys. They really thought of everything. Even a water cooler at the beach.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were looking for a place to relax by the pool, play some games with the kids and enjoy, and that is exactly what we found.","Feb 27, 2005","12","9",5,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$227"
"hotel_104","hotel_5948","Glamour in the south! Ended up in the southern part of the island escaping cold winds in the north. Very ritzy hotel for this small city and enjoyed our stay of one night (2/17/05). Big open air lobby and large pool; black sand beach but water clear when observed from a distance. Interesting walk to the channel and boardwalk. Ponce almost European in atmosphere-and very cultural-lots of museums.Food and service OK; staff spoke English as well as we did!

"hotel_104","hotel_2265","Relaxation was my goal We stayed 01/23/05-01/29/05. It was a business trip for my husband and I came along just to get away and relax. We flew into San Juan, rented a car and drove about 90 minutes to Ponce. The drivers here can be impatient and somewhat crazy. At the hotel we self parked our car and checked into a room on the fourth floor. The room was decorated with a tropical feel and was very clean (I like the idea of clean tile floors vs carpet in a hotel room). We had a great view of the beach area and ocean. This is a GREAT place to go if you want a relaxing vacation during this time of year. The number of guests at the pool varied from 8 to 15. They have a great beach area with lots of lounge chairs, play area for children, picnic tables, and access (appeared inaccessible to the public ) to a public beach area. Jogs and walks along the beach were nice. The gate to this beach closes at 6pm. I also enjoyed using the gym facilities. Food was average to above average. Buffet breakfast was great, dinner watching sports on the big screen at outdoor bar area was great and access to the exec lounge for breakfast, appetizers, dessert and coffee was convenient and staff was outstanding. We never did eat at La Cava restaurant since other reviews on this site did not rave about it. The casino at times could have been a bit cleaner and tidy, but we had fun there. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help us. The only misunderstanding was when I inquired on a Tuesday morning about a haircut. I was told the salon was open Fridays and Saturdays but they could arrange to call someone in to do it (I declined). When I called on Friday for the appointment, I was told they are open during the week at 1 pm and Fridays and Saturdays at 10 am. Anyway, I got a great haircut at a reasonable price. This city is not quite ready for tourists. We visited Seralles Castle (very nice tourguide) and adjacent cross. The downtown was congested. We tried to visit the cathedral but it had closed at 2pm that day. The only purchases we made were rum and coffee. We traveled to the Ponce Port and expected to find lots of shops and restaurants. What we found was a nice place to go for a walk and several food stands. This hotel is a great place to relax and good place for business travelers. Looks like the golf course is quite nice too. The hotel has a wonderful open air atmosphere and staffed with friendly helpful people. Most of the staff spoke english. It was an enjoyable stay.","Feb 17, 2005","11","11",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$227"

"hotel_105","hotel_8047","Great Location We stayed here for a 4 night city break over New Year 2008/09 on room only basis.The location of the hotel is excellent, being on La Ramblas which is in the centre of the main tourist area and only a couple of hundred metres from the airport bus stop in Pl Catalunya.From the outside the hotel is very clean and well kept and this impression continued inside. Reception was efficient and the staff had a good command of English which is always a help. Our rooms were ground floor at the rear which meant that they were very quiet (La Ramblas is very noisy and I think that front facing rooms might suffer because of this). Being ground floor they also had small terraces which looked a bit claustrophobic but might be OK for a bit of shady peace in the summer.The rooms were fairly standard with twin beds, TV, minibar, bath/shower etc. (but no kettle!). Again these were well kept, clean and reasonably comfortable.We didn't eat in the hotel at all so I can't comment on the food but there are plenty of cafes and restuarants in the area (tip - don't eat in La Ramblas itself but go a couple of streets either side for much better value).The only down side I have for this hotel is that it is very expensive. We wanted a central hotel and accepted that we would have to pay a premium for this. Next time, now that I know my way around Barcelona, I would consider staying further out as the savings on hotel bills would (probably) more than cover bus/metro/taxi fares in and out.","Jan 5, 2009","0","0",3,4,6,5,5,5,1,"4","$261"

Though I agree that it can be quite noisy, but it all adds to the atmosphere and we had no trouble sleeping. One thing to add though about noise is the rumbling you can hear late into the night which is the metro passing by the hotel!!We didnt take the breakfast option and found a wonderful tapas bar.

We stayed in a superior room on the 7th floor (708) that had a seating area and a balcony at the back of the hotel. Very quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla. Bathroom was modern with chrome fixtures. Hardwood floors and automatic sun blocking window shades. Easy access to aerobus. Beware their elevators are tiny that only 2 people can fit.

Our room, a triple, was more like a suite with a bedroom and living room/daybed for the third guest. The decorations are very modern-black bathtub, brown velvet bedspreads--but cool and tasteful. The location of the hotel (on the nicer part of La Ramba) is very convenient, and as we had a room overlooking the courtyard, there was no problem with noise. Breakfast each morning had a large selection, including some hot foods (eggs, omlettes), and it was served outside in the charming garden. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.","Sep 16, 2008","2","2",5,5,6,5,4,4,1,"4","$261"
"hotel_105","hotel_4001","We liked the Ramblas a lot We were at the Rivoli Rambla three nights last week, and would stay there again. The location can't be beat, right on the Rambla, a two minute walk to the central square where buses leave for the AP every ten minutes or so. The room we were in faced onto the Courtyard, which we requested because it was so quiet. The rooms opening out to the Rambla are great for atmosphere, but believe me, Barcelona folk don't go to sleep at night, and the street noise is considerable. The room we were in was very well appointed, the bathroom great. The TV was minimal, to say the least, but it did bring in Sky News, and we weren't in the room that long, anyway. The breakfast was included in our deal, and was excellent. Not worth $30 bucks apiece, if we were paying extra for it, but what breakfast is? If breakfast is not included in your deal, there are lots of cheaper eating places around. BUT, Barcelona is expensive. I confess we ate at the McDonalds on the Rambla one evening, a McDonalds fish sandwich, fries and a coke, and the tab was $9 bucks APIECE. But this is a vote for the Rivoli Rambla, with a special note about the friendliness of the woman on the front desk.","Sep 2, 2008","4","4",5,5,6,5,6,1,1,"4","$261"

It should be noted that there are two wings in the hotel, the modern wing and the traditional wing - I strongly suggest you opt for the modern rooms as traditional appeared to be a flowery way of saying in need of a refurb!You are right in the heart of it all here, with the infamous Las Ramblas on your doorstep - thus quality restuarants, bars and great shopping are never more than a stones throw away.Highly recommended for a short city break.","Aug 20, 2008","2","2",5,6,6,5,5,5,4,"4","$261"

The room was ready on arrival and was very large with a huge balcony with table and chairs. The bathroom was also very big. The room was clean and had everything we needed. However, I did think that it was rather expensive at 120 euros per night, although I suppose you have to remember that this is in a city on the main street in Barcelona. The location was excellent - right on la Ramblas, so everything was nearby. The room was cleaned daily. We did not eat at the hotel as there as so many places to choose from nearby. We did get a coffee in the bar just before we were leaving and I must say that the bar man was incredibly rude - didn't say one word to us at all.

WiFi is free, but signal is very weak. so sometimes you cannot make a connection. most of the staff cannot even answer the most simplest of question or request. breakfast is ok but nothing great. even their scrambled eggs taste bad.all i can say is that they serve good coffee for breakfast.","Apr 12, 2008","0","0",4,3,5,2,4,2,2,"4","$261"

I didnt eat anything in the hotel so cant comment on the food. Only negative point is that the toilet door in our room (and the room our friends were in) were on runners rather than hinges meaning a lack of privacy noise wise - which is no good if you are shy!!Barcelona is a great city but just a word of warning if you fancy going there for New Years Eve - it got a bit wild late at night on New Years Eve on La Ramblas (at one point just outside our hotel) and the police were there using their batons to control the drunken behaviour that was going on. Quite scary to watch and we were pleased to be safe inside our hotel whilst it was going on. So not really a place to take your kids if you plan on stopping out late on a New Years Eve to see the new year in. It did calm down after a while so we went back out to continue our new year celebrations and had a good night.One other thing to note is that having become so accustomed to the smoking ban indoors in the UK it was hard (as a non-smoker) to go back to sitting in restaurants and pubs with people smoking right next to you.","Feb 23, 2008","2","2",5,5,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$261"

Using the English hotel rating I would say 2/3 with a 3 star maximum. We were lucky to get a bigger room as the hotel wasn鈥檛 busy so think they swopped our room with a more spacious disabled room on the 2nd floor. Walking past all the other rooms being cleaned we noticed they were small and badly decorated. Room was clean, although furnishings a little tired, but the bathroom smelt musty like it had no ventilation or had not been used for months. A scented candle in the room sorted this out though. The beds were comfortable and rooms facing las ramblas are fairly noisy, so this will be worse in the height of summer. No tea/coffee facilities which meant you had to order drinks on room service which shut at 11pm. Reception staff were not very helpful and one was even asleep at the desk when we got in at midnight! My mine gripe was wanting to use the 鈥渇itness centre鈥? We were told no problem and they needed 3 hrs notice to heat the Jacuzzi. This was fine but when we got there the Jacuzzi was lukewarm and the fitness centre was just one cross trainer. Then they told me this would be 鈧?5 extra each as all guests pay for the centre. I think they get their 4 star out of providing fitness facilities, but one cross trainer does not a fitness centre make! All in all, it was ok, not great, but perfect location meant you could see past all the little things.

"hotel_105","hotel_6125","Good as a base for your trip Firstly, as a base for a holiday the location was absolutely perfect. So close to everything..... metro, sightseeing bus tour, La Rambla walk itself and the marina. While during the daytime once on your guard you could ramble around the wonderful little side streets surrounding the hotel at night time it was somewhere very different. Watch your belongings, unfortunately as we learned pick pocketing was rife. The rooms in the hotel were clean (rooms cleaned daily) but basic. One Big Big fault was no tea coffee making facilities in the room. Room service ended at 11pm so if you were thirsty after that - TOUGH. Noise level was high, put it this way - there was no need to set your alarm, the cleaners made sure of that. Banging and vaccuming from the early hours, and the cardboard walls could do with some noise insulation, if not for quiet then just for privacy.Don't be attracted by the gym, sauna etc facilities either, booking three hours in advance was a requisition, however, the solarium was a sun lounger on the terrace not an actual sunbed.Overall, I would stay again purely for convenient location only, if the hospitality/ basic facilities was better the hotel would be rated much higher in our estimation.","Jan 20, 2008","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$261"

I would not advise it for women travelling alone, the area might make you feel just a little bit uncomfortable after dark, bag snatchers everywhere. Rooms, service and breakfast of ligh standards.

Felt like I was intruding when I asked the desk staff for anything. Not one of them knows how to smile. I always hear the French hate Americans and are very rude, but the Spanish have them beat by a landslide.There was a bidet, but being American I have no idea what to use it for when there was a perfectly good shower/tub right next to it.

The location is especially marvelous (right on Las Ramblas, close to Placa de Catalyuna and the airport buses)! We were not even bothered by any noise from the street (though we're from NYC). Room was clean and the only slight drawbacks are that (1) the hotel is actually two buildings connected together, such that one side of the hotel is a little inconvenient to get to (5-6 steps up/down once off the elevators) if you have heavy bags or a wheelchair and (2) you can hear the scraping of chairs against the floors both above and below your hotel room. But there aren't tons of people hanging out in the bar downstairs, so it was not a huge distraction for us during this stay. BATHROOM DETAILS: We had a gigantic tub, good water pressure in the shower (though no door or curtain, so that room can get a bit wet post-bathing), bidet, toilet and sink with large surface vanity area.ROOM DETAILS: Beds were reasonably sized (wide twins; our king bed was two wide twins pushed together), though there were not many blankets for a room that can get quite chilly with the AC running. There was a mini fridge and I think an electric kettle for tea would have made it perfect. Large windows that faced onto Las Ramblas with electronic shades for keeping out the noonday sun during siesta.I'd definitely stay here again the next time I visit Barcelona and would certainly recommend it for travellers who want a nice room without a high price tag. It is not a budget hotel nor is it a luxury hotel. And it is not faux-contemporary, either -- it is *actually* contemporary in some rooms and our room, one of the ones recently renovated, was great.","Apr 25, 2007","6","6",5,5,6,5,4,4,4,"4","$261"
"hotel_105","hotel_10238","Superb Location, Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel for 3 days in July 2006, and am surprised by some of the reviews here. I had an excellent room overlooking Las Ramblas and was more than delighted with the hotel, the staff and the overall service. The room was spotless, the towels changed daily. Yes there was renovation work, the hotel is upgrading floor at a time, but the floor that was being worked on was closed off to residents, and there was no disruption whatsoever. We booked through our local independant travel agent who was able to secure us excellent rates. The internet is not always the cheapest or the most reliable way to book accommodation. The buffet breakfast was adequate. The reception and the bar areas are small, but this is an historic building in the heart of an historic city, so there is going to be limited space. Good quality hotel, with the three things that matter most of all: location, location, location! Would return here without hesitation.","Apr 6, 2007","6","5",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$261"
"hotel_105","hotel_4826","Excellent all round! After reading earlier reviews I was not overly confident of the hotel before arrival but this really was a 4 star in every respect, if not better.We had a family room, which was spacious and equipped with whirlpool bath, mini bar, safe, and balcony view over the Ramblas, and hotel staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. We did not use the terrace bar,gym or spa, which has an extra charge, though the area was more than sufficient. The piano bar in main reception was friendly and the bar staff were excellent with our six year old son.It did appear that the hotel had undergone refurbishment, all areas were extremely clean and tidy, very nice atmosphere and the breakfast, which was included in the price, was excellent.Location is just 100 metres from Placa Catalunya, a main line metro stop and all sight-seeing bus tours, and whilst there is very minor noise from the metro this does not disturb you in the day or night.When returning to Barcelona this hotel will be top of the list to return to, if you are planning a trip I would certainly recommend.Top Tip: Do not use the Pizzeria Grill restaurant opposite the hotel, probably the worst food I have ever had, and extremely over-priced, turn left out of the hotel and towards the end of Las Ramblas there are many good and varied restaurants!","Apr 5, 2007","7","7",5,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$261"

Did lots of walking around the town and could always find our way back as street is well signposted. Only down side was that our room was on the second floor overlooking la ramblas and was noisy in the middle of the night and first thing in the morning. It was however a small price to pay as we could watch the hustle and bustle of the area (and the fantastic street artists) during the day and in the evening from the balcony. Breakfast was good for pastries and bread, though cooked breakfast was not to our taste. Restaurant was open too late in the evening (9.30ish).

Excellent balcony to sit out on during the early evening with the no obstructions to the sun and although it wasn't overly noisy, the fact the room was on the front did mean it was possible to hear the sirens and some of the noisier tourists at some peculiar times of the morning. There was ongoing work on the 4th floor and the gym facilities still weren't open. Didn't sample anything extra in this hotel so can't really comment on the service, food or prices.

"hotel_105","hotel_8805","Over-rated and over-priced In summary the Rivoli Ramblas is a poor hotel in a great location. Given the cost and the four star rating much more was expected. Specific problems were:Tired Decor, exceptionally rude and scruffy bar staff, warm air only from air-con (indeed it was confirmed by reception that this was common to all rooms), gym and spa closed due to refurbishment (which I note from an earlier post was underway in July 2005), unadvertised local charge for sauna, fee for use of in-room safe and drilling and hammering noise during the day owing to the refurbs.On the plus side the breakfast was one of the best I've had and the location really is prime.If you are getting a good rate at this hotel in comparison to others in the area it may be worth a punt, but in hindsight we would have looked for availability at other 2 or 3 star hotels at the same price point.","Jan 23, 2006","9","7",3,3,1,4,1,3,1,"4","$261"

"hotel_105","hotel_4439","'Standard rooms' below standard for a 4* Hotel ! Just returned from 3 nights at the Rivoli Hotel - on the positive side the Hotellocation is excellent - although given the ease with which most people canfind their way around the city - location should not matter. The breakfastwas also excellent - good choice - fresh fruits - cooked - buffet style - verygood.The rooms ? Well if like me you had gone on their website and built up anexpectation of beautiful - spacious - well appointed rooms - and then youcheck in and your standard room is anything but standard for a 4 starhotel.I have stayed in loads of 4* hotels in Ireland in a standard room - which was 4* but the Rivoli standard was about 2* - at a push !!! The room was small - carpet stained - the bathroom had clear cieling tiles - where bits of debris had fallen onto it - the shower door didnt work so the floor flooded when you had a shower ! We were on the 6th floor - with a lift which could barely hold 3 people and took ages to come up. We had a balcony with spectacular views into next doors back yard and a very entusisatic cleaner who tried to start cleaning at 7-30am !!! The air conditioning was pathetic - we had to sleep with the balcony doors open.For all this luxury - we paid 160-00 euro per night - approx 拢110-00 Stg - I have no issue paying 160-00 euro for a good standard of hotel accomodation but I feel totally let down by this experience - The Rivoli Hotel should be utterly ashamed and I dont know how they can claim 4* status with this level of accomodation!Come across to the UK / Ireland and see what a 4* Hotel really is !!","Mar 29, 2005","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$261"

Paint peeling off the walls and grotty decor. Moved rooms and was shown one equally as awful. We then were moved to one of their most Modern rooms which was lovely. Fab bathroom and great decor throughout. This room had obviously just been redecorated. Once settled we had a great time. The hotel was in the perfect location in the centre of the Ramblas and the staff were OK. I would definitely recommend it, just don'nt settle for a rubbish room!","Mar 12, 2005","6","6",4,5,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$261"
"hotel_105","hotel_1968","Superb! Managed to get a real bargain from expedia. Rooms decorated in Spanish rustic style, ours even had a sofa, as well as a ludicrously comfortable bed. We were lucky enough to be on the 7th floor at the back of the hotel and there was a balcony with table and chairs - would have been perfect for watching the sun go down over over the cathedral if we hadn't visited in February!Bathrooms of an extremely high standard, with bath, shower, toilet and bidet. A thoughful array of toiletries provided including, unusually, a sponge and comb. There is a hairdryer next to the basin.The Rivoli Breakfast at 20 Euros probably works out about the same as a breakfast in England (however, note the additional 6% IVA), but this was a real feast featuring orange juice, large fresh fruit salad marinated in real orange juice, bacon, eggs, toast, more fruit (i.e. oranges, apples), delicious danish pastries (the ones containing custard cream was particularly popular), toast and croissants, jam, marmalade, butter, and tea or coffee. And, as a final touch, 20cl bottles of Cava! Ideal if you have something to celebrate.On our second night, we arrived back very late to find that the bed had been turned down and little chocolates left.Service at the hotel was excellent, the staff speak good English - better than my Spanish, anyway - and are happy to order cabs to the airport. The Blue Moon bar on the ground floor is a nice place for a relaxing drink. The location is perfect - at the top of the Ramblas, close to the Metro, El Cortes Ingles, the Cathedral. In short, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Children are welcome and it's a good base for families wishing to explore the city.

"hotel_105","hotel_3662","Rooms vary from 2* to 4* It is obvious from the reviews on this site that the rooms in this hotel vary widely. I booked three twins. The two on the 2nd floor were excellent in every respect. However, our room on the 3rd floor was smaller and had minor faults (no mirror in bedroom. no sound on Sky, missing light bulb) but it was quite well furnished with a pleasant balcony overlooking the Ramblas.Many of your reviews comment on the helpfulness and pleasant attitude of the staff. I can only assume that there have been changes to hotel personel since those reviews. I found the reception staff and the porters to be very friendly and helpful but the bar staff were sorely in need of retraining. There was no attempt to make the customer feel welcome. No smiles, no eye contact, no greetings. The drinks were just plonked down silently. There are plenty of pleasant staff in the bars around the Ramblas so we didn't have to frequent the Rivoli's miserable bar and put up with their miserable staff. Moreover, the bar was advertised as a piano bar but during our stay (February 2005) there was no piano player and a large notice on the piano warning guests not to play the instrument. Like they were afraid we might actually enjoy ourselves! This was a pity since one of our party is a competent piano player and might have cheered the place up a bit.In spite of the above criticisms I would return to this hotel but would want to insist on a good room. I paid the same price for all three rooms and feel that each room should have been of the same standard. They weren't. But the hotel scores highly for it's location which couldn't be bettered.","Feb 18, 2005","8","8",4,4,1,5,1,3,1,"4","$261"

No bathtub in the bathroom (big problem when you have an 18 month old that is afraid of showering). Worse yet is that the shower consisted of a showerhead. No shower curtain, no partition. In fact, all the water from the shower ends up drenching the entire bathroom floor because the shower area is actually on a raised surface, allowing the water to cascade down and collect all over creation. This could create a dangerous situation for those who actually are handicapped. No counter space in the bathroom. There is a small counter area with zero lighting outside of the bathroom - completely useless.

So I paid for the rental an extra night for transportation to airport which is very close.. HOWEVER, they do call you a cab. When I mentioned this to the front desk they told me I must have looked at the wrong website. I was given a kingsize bed for 3 people when I asked for two beds (I called after booking and was told I had to request at check in) I was told none was available. As I resign myself to sleeping with 3 in a bed, I get to the room to find a sleeper sofa.. they could have mentioned that as it was satisfactory. When I returned the rental car and called for a ride back they couldn't tell me where to meet the van. They call it the blue diamond area. However the airport employees call it door 2 south curb, having never been to the airport it would have been easier to have everyone call it the same thing. They did call a cab which was a town car with a very friendly driver at 4am for us. however, noone was at the front desk for us to check out. We waited 15 minutes for someone to come so we could checkout (we had room service the night before which was delicious and prompt) The hotel and room were clean and perfect for what we needed. The front desk staff were just frustrating after an 8 day vacation in flagstaff I just wanted it to be simple and it wasn't.","Sep 5, 2007","0","0",6,6,6,6,2,5,6,"4","$185"
"hotel_114","hotel_4374","ok for a layover Stayed here for approx. 8 hours on a layover with my three children and elderly mother. Waited for a shuttle approx. 20 minutes. They hire another company at night to shuttle guests. We were on our way home after a long vacation and had 8 pcs of luggage plus our carry ons. The shuttle driver was nice and helpful. Upon arriving at hotel, I was told this is not a four star hotel by the front desk girl and that guests have to haul their own luggage and laughed about it with the other desk girl! Not a very good attitude. We arrived at 10 pm and the restaurant was closed so, I walked to the next hotel where there was a waffle house in front of it for a take out. Not bad considering. Room was ok. Beds were dbls and comfortable. Definitely only a 3 star. Paid $70 on HOTWIRE. Wouldn't pay more.

"hotel_114","hotel_6936","Overall good, some problems Stayed for one night, and was generally pleased. We arrived on a late-night flight, so did not check in until about 2am. The front desk clerk was friendly, and the room clean and spacious when we arrived. Unfortunately, when we attempted to go to bed, the sleep number bed would not inflate. After changing rooms at 3am (not really a pleasant thing to have to do), the new bed worked. Once in the new room, called the front desk to request a wake-up call and a late (2pm) check-out. We did not receive our wake-up call, and our late check-out was not documented. Overall impressions: The public areas and rooms have been recently renovated and are attractive and spacious. The rooms are clean. The pool is located next to a freeway offramp, and the deck area around it is very small - not the best experience, but acceptable for an airport hotel. I see that an earlier review also mentioned non-functioning sleep-number beds, I would recommend checking the bed as soon as you arrive.

"hotel_114","hotel_3913","Great Hotel near the Airport My wife and I stayed at this hotel last weekend when we had to fly out of the Phoenix Airport at the unGodly hour of 5:30am. The hotel advertised 24-hour shuttle service, which is fairly rare in my experiences (although I do not claim to be an expert). When we checked in, we were informed that the shuttle ran from 5:30am until 10:30pm but that they would call us a cab and pay for it (something else I had never experienced in the past). The cab was a Towncar service.The hotel room was somewhat oddly laid out but was very functional. Radisson recently upgraded all of their rooms to include Sleep Number beds and we found the bed to be comfortable but certainly not the most comfortable I've ever slept on. To be fair, neither my wife nor I sleep well before an early morning flight (probably due to fears of missing the plane) so I'm not sure if we might have been more optimistic about the beds under different circumstances. The room was well appointed and relatively spacious. No one could have found faults with the hotel or the hotel room's cleanliness. Wireless internet service was included as well. The front desk staff was very pleasant and professional. We had a few drinks at the bar but did not try to eat at the on site restaurant.Overall an excellent stay at a recommended hotel.","Oct 19, 2006","0","0",4,5,6,6,6,5,5,"4","$185"

The tv hutch was broken but that was no biggy. The beds were nice and the couch sofa bed was also nice for use. We ate dinner at the restr. in the lobby and the food was good. Margarita's were also very good. We used the shuttle to take our son to the airport and then the shuttle came back to pick my husband and I up and back to the hotel, which meant no parking hassles at the airport or anything. That was nice as it was July 4th weekend and the airport was a complete mess and packed. The front desk service was wonderful as well as the restr. and the shuttle driver.

"hotel_114","hotel_9442","Definitely a good deal! I named my price of $39 on Priceline and it was accepted. I found out afterward the hotel would be the Radisson Phoenix Airport on University Blvd. Some of the reviews were bad, but I figured for the price it couldn't be THAT bad. My young son and I were traveling to Phoenix for a family get-together and just needed a hotel room for one night. We arrived late during a raging monsoon storm! Yikes! When we got to the Radisson, the night desk clerk (a man) did not look up from his computer screen for what seemed like a long time. I was standing right across from him! Finally he looked up and said do you need something? Uh.... yeah... how about to check in? Duh. After that he was fine. We requested a 2pm checkout (normal is 12 noon) and he said it wouldn't be a problem. We got a room with a king sleep-number bed. We got into the hotel room and tried out the bed. As I tried to lower the number on my side of the bed (with the remote) the thing completely deflated! It was flat as a pancake and wouldn't respond to the remote any longer. But after calling down to the desk we were moved to another room (on the Executive Level - 6). You need a 6th floor key card for the elevator to even go up to that level. That seemed cool and a little more safe. For $39 bucks you can't beat that. The new room was the same layout, not sure why it's executive but whatever. The bed worked great and all was well.The disappointments were: no fridge and no microwave. Those would have helped.The room was clean, the bathroom was clean and nice. I didn't see a problem. They give you a little card to fill out and hang on your door to order room service breakfast (needs to be on door by 1 am), which we did, and it was delivered promptly when we indicated the next morning. They forgot our toast but I called and they brought it right up. It was marginally good. It was nice not to have to get up and shower, get dressed, etc. just to go have breakfast. We were tired.We went swimming later in the pool. No one was out there except one other guest. It was nice. Then we checked out. It took quite a long time being that there was only one desk clerk and two people in front of me. The clerk was very professional and good. She was a woman with a foreign accent - Pakistan or the like. I think her name was Venetia. Very good.The location was good - easy to get to and convenient. The neighborhood is FINE - I didn't understand why some people felt unsafe there.Overall I am very pleased with the Radisson. My sister paid full rate and wasn't quite as pleased (I can understand that!) but for what I paid, it was very nice.","Aug 18, 2006","0","0",5,5,5,5,3,5,1,"4","$185"

Negatives: the lobby and first floor smell like the bottom of an ashtray, and the restaurant looks like an afterthought. The workout room would have been nice if it had been open. But at $62, we couldn't complain. It isn't really that close to the airport, but there is a shuttle available. Also, if you don't have ground transportation, you may have to take a cab to a restaurant - the hotel is in an office park area; a Waffle House is the only restaurant I saw within walking distance.","Mar 24, 2006","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$185"

The hotel itself is very clean and the staff was nice. The pillowtop mattress was very comfortable. The elevators broke down while I was there and then when I took the stairs the stairwell on the 1st floor was locked which was a little upsetting.

We were told when we made reservations that some of the publc rooms were being remodeled and they certainly were. Even the swimming pool was off limits and we were told to go across the street and use another hotel's pool. That was bad news. They were not very busy, yet our room overlooked a busy through street facing West and eight hours of bright, hot sunshine. The room was over-priced and very depressing in decorating aspects. The restaurant's food was ok but extremely over-priced. Every time you asked a question of the staff, they would say they didn't know because they had only been there a week or two weeks.

"hotel_115","hotel_1346","Wonderfully relaxing with great service My wife and I decided to visit Phoenix to get a break from the humidity where we live. After much research, we settled on the Royal Palms. We were not disappointed.On arrival, the valet staff were cheery and helpful, even offering to run small errands for us, such as a trip to the corner store, etc. The check-in process was smooth and the gentleman helping us with our bags was well informed about the resort's features, history, and amenities. The property is lush and well planted - a tropical oasis in the middle of the dessert. Beautiful.The rooms were clean, warm and inviting. The view of Camelback Mountain from our room was very romantic. The housekeeping staff were very thorough and the nightly turn-down service was a nice touch.I was suffering from a cold so we decided to stay in one evening. My wife ordered room service and when the wait staff arrived and noticed the cough syrup on the table, he showed genuine concern, explaining that the Royal Palms took illness very seriously and he would be happy to have the chef prepare some chicken soup and a hot toddy.Caring and attentive service was found throughout the property, with the pool attendants offering the best service. They were always ready to fill a drink, bring a glass of water, find a chair, refresh towels, etc. The pool bar closes a little early (6pm?) but the pool and hot-tub remain open all night. Great relief from the heat. The pool area was basically adults only. There was an occassional kid, but I got the impression children weren't encouraged. In fact, I overheard one of the valet's radio the pool attendant to let him know that Shamu had arrived (a family with an inflatable whale). They put a stop to that and we never did see Shamu or the kids.The restaurant was exceptionally good, although I did have one negative experience when I chose to sit outside to eat. We sat for about ten minutes and never did see any wait staff, even though the maitre'd assured us there was service on the patio. To be fair, it was very hot and nobody in their right mind would want to be outside and I was sick and didn't wait very long before leaving to head to our room.The lounge, adjacent to the restaurant had a great selection of drinks, a funky vibe, and great entertainment. It was hard to find a seat, but once seated the service was very attentive.My wife and I both had spa treatments while we were there. The spa was nothing spectacular, but very comfortable. Noticing I had a terrible cough, the masseuse even took the time to call me the next day to give me the name of a cough syrup his doctor had recommended to him.I noticed that some travellers complained about the $22 per day resort fee. This fee includes valet parking and all tips. It is a bargain - you would spend that much on valet in most hotels.Speaking of valet, if you call ahead before leaving your room, the valets will have your car ready and waiting with the air conditioner on.I fell in love with the place and will definitely be back.","Aug 19, 2008","1","1",6,5,6,6,6,6,4,"4.5","$490"

Once you pull up into the courtyard, you feel like you are transported into another world. Aside from the immaculate service and lush, impeccable grounds, the vibe is the ultimate in laid-back luxury. Trust me, you will not have to lift a finger while you are there. We went into Old Town Scottsdale once and came to the conclusion that there was really no point in leaving our perfect oasis! The resort is perfect for a romantic getaway (next time we are going with our husbands, and trust me, there will be a next time!), but if you go with a friend you'll feel right at home too. People actually dress for dinner - this is not a t-shirt  shorts place, which is oh so fun if you're used to being in mommy-mode. If you are looking for a restful, tranquil vacation with amazing dining and a decadent spa, this is the place for you.","Aug 6, 2008","0","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_3898","Relaxed and LOVED our stay We decided on a last minute stay at the Royal Palms and could not have been more pleased. It was the most luxurious hotel that I have stayed at in a long time and is so relaxing. We opted just to stay in one of the standard rooms and it was fabulous. It is like having your own little villa with a small patio overlooking the lime trees and Camelback mountain. We never head another person walk by our room or any other noises during the day. The pool is quite crowded so if you are going to hang out at the pool then you might not like this hotel but if you are going for some relaxing ambiance then this is the place. We will be returning.","Aug 5, 2008","0","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_5804","Wonderful! We loved every second of our five-day stay at the Royal Palms Resort  Spa. The grounds were beautiful- well maintained and had a tropical feel. The pool is small- not great for laps, but wonderful for floating. I think the smallish number of chairs might be a problem when the hotel is fuller than it probably was when we were there. The umbrellas are huge and offered a lot of shade, but if you wanted sun you could have it (do you want to sit in the sun in 105 degree heat?). We stayed in room 138, which had the world's most comfortable bed, a nice sitting area, a flat-screen television with standard cable, a private area outside and a newly redone bathroom. Housekeeping kept the rooms spotless. We enjoyed turndown service every night and looked forward to cards and candies we would find. The restaurant is good, but expensive. You can eat at the lounge, where entrees range in price from about $14 to about $40. If you do, definitely try the tempura asparagus- it was a highlight! There is a $22 daily gratuity fee attached to your nightly stay, and it is totally worth it. I cannot stress enough how attentive the staff is. When we called for our car, the men actually ran to get it to us faster. The concierge was wonderful, and when we did have a mix-up with a resort activity we had signed up for but wasn't offered, they bent over backwards to make it up to us. We would love to return!","Aug 3, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,4,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_5489","simply great hotel with service to match Just had a wonderful six night stay at the Palms with my wife. Had a shock at check-in when they told me of the $22 a night service charge but it was worth every cent, due to the excellent friendly staff at the resort (special mention to the pool staff and the car valets), who earned it and more. Very few negatives and lots of positives. The pool area is not the largest and would be pushed to serve everyones needs when the hotel is full. However when it is quiet, as when we were there, then it is ideal. Staff keep you supplied with constant iced water (free of charge), food if required and move the parasols when required, so you do not over do the sunbathing (unless you realy do want to fry). Rooms comforable and there is a turn down service supplied at night. The attention to detail is excellent. Will be going back again as it also makes an excellent base to see the rest of Arizona.","Aug 3, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4.5","$490"

If you book online, please remember you will be responsible for paying the resort fee. It was $22 per day during our stay. The fee is used to pay gratuity to the valet, bell staff and housekeepers.

If you can, or if you're there for any other reason, stay at the Royal Palms! This resort is small and romantic and the landscape is gorgeous; even in the heat of the summer, the grounds were lush and full. I was there with my husband, my parents, and my sister on a family vacation, but the resort was predominantly couples. The few families that came to the intimate pool left quickly when they saw that the atmosphere was quiet and not conducive to loud children. The service was absolutely unbelievable at every turn (Rick at the pool takes service to another level...) and, in the one case it wasn't (the spa did not have our appointments in its system), the extremely apologetic staff bent over backwards to accommodate us. The Royal Palms was such a breath of fresh air and a completely unexpected respite I would visit again in a second.","Jul 21, 2008","0","0",6,5,6,6,6,6,1,"4.5","$490"

The service was excellent and as foodies and wine lovers, we were pleased to see that the waiter knew his stuff. The valets were very, very helpful and pleasant (especially a young guy named Brandon!). Our first trip to Phoenix was in 110 degree heat, but we loved it all the same, in fact we are hoping to return at christmas. If that doesn't work out we will go back another time.

"hotel_115","hotel_10582","Could do better Spent two nights here in June. Having read the rave reviews we were somewhat disappointed. First impressions were certainly not good; the reception staff did not exactly fall over themselves to be helpful and the decor seemed a little faded. The pool area was very average and some new soft furnishing was clearly needed .Felt better when we had settled in- the room was large and comforatble and my wife loved the bath. Enjoyed an excellent meal in the restaurant though again the decoration was a little old fashoined. Highlight of stay was sitting in a courtyard with a bottle of wine under the stars. Liked the feel of the place in the evening with lots of clever lighting and quiet acoustic guitar. Overall it was ok. Think they will need to up their game if they want to maintain their prices.

"hotel_115","hotel_1931","A Little Disappointing... We stayed at the Royal Palms Resort over Father's Day weekend and left with mixed emotions. We booked a standard room, and while it was clean and nicely appointed, it was quite small. The bath tub was ridiculous! An older person would have found it unuseable. We almost needed a step stool to get into it. We found the concierge to be helpful enough, but the front desk attendant seemed to have a forced smile and never mailed our postcards (after offering to do so).We had a delicious dinner at T. Cook's. Our table was disappointing, though. It was right next to the kitchen, even though we had made the reservation months in advance and were obviously hotel guests. On a brighter note, our food server could not have been more attentive and gracious.The grounds of the Royal Palms are pretty, and the valet attendants were very speedy and pleasant. However, we have stayed at many other four and five star resorts in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and would probably not return to Royal Palms.

"hotel_115","hotel_1592","Soooooo glad we chose the Royal Palms!!! OMG!!! The Royal Palms is now our favorite place to stay in greater Phoenix. I treated my husband to a weekend there for his birthday in May, and was not really sure what to expect. We had previously stayed at the Biltmore, which was always delightful, but I thought we should explore something new. Lucky for us, our friends recommended this resort and it turned out to be one of those where have you been all my life? experiences. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was PERFECT. We can't wait for a reason to get back up there, unbearable Phoenix heat and all (we live in Tucson and everyone knows it is always at least 10 degrees hotter in Phoenix than Tucson and even when it's over 100, it MATTERS). **Bonus Tip: for a lovely, intimate, absolutely five star meal, go to Christopher's at the Biltmore Plaza.

"hotel_115","hotel_10032","Beautiful, intimate, perfect service This was my third stay at the Royal Palms and the fact that I keep returning despite there being so many great places to stay in Phoenix and Scottsdale should tell you something. I love the Royal Palms. The whole property is beautiful, the resort is small enough to feel intimate, and the service is always amazing.I like the Montevista Terrace rooms, which have a patio or balcony overlooking a central courtyard with a decorative pool and pretty sitting areas set around firepits. The rooms are a decent size and beautifully decorated with particularly nice bathrooms which have deep oval soaking tubs and separate shower cubicles. There is even a 'window (no glass, just an opening with shutters to close if you want privacy) cut into the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom which is a nice touch. The Estate rooms are basically the same, and in the same building, but don't have a patio or balcony and lack the view.The only downside is the smallish pool area. The pool is beautiful, the sunloungers very comfortable and the service great, but the pool area and the pool itself are quite small and so both can feel crowded and noisy if the hotel is busy. Luckily it's not a very child-friendly hotel so it tends to be groups of adults only, but even then it can get a bit frenetic and noisy at the pool which you might find annoying if you're looking for peace and quiet. Nevertheless, it's hard to find fault with anything and I've had 3 very enjoyable visits (March 07, Dec 07 and Apr08).","Jun 18, 2008","2","2",5,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4.5","$490"

The room was beautifully appointed with shutters above the sunken tub that open on to the room. The resort was very quiet with only the sound of the fountains to lull you to sleep each night. The pool was small but very clean. They provide nice rafts to relax on as well as ice water with lemon. We had dinner at T Cooks and enjoyed sitting out on the terrace looking at the stars.

"hotel_115","hotel_2773","Beautiful hotel but probably not for families Just returned from a three night stay. I did not select this hotel as we were with a group for a wedding. Our rooms were $567 per night with a $22.00 resort fee to cover gratuities. Very high I felt!The grounds of the resort are amazing. Lush with lots and lots of flowers. We stayed in two casitas connecting with King Beds. Which were perfect. Away from the main hotel with nice courtyards in front to enjoy breakfast! Ours had a small water fountain also. The rooms were above average with nice beds and comfortable furnishings. One room had a fireplace although not cool enough outside to use it. The bathroom was just OK.All the staff were courteous and helpful. Questions were answered immediately especially room service. I requested several special dishes with no problem. I would recommend this resort to others even though I had a slight issue with Jose by the pool. On our first morning to the resort we took our two children (5  9) to the pool. We were out early probably by 9:30 that morning. The pool area had a few guests already but not many. My children had only been in the pool a few minutes when Jose approached me to tell me my children had to quote, not yell, horseplay, jump, splash or play Marco Polo in the pool. and that he was just telling me before he got complaints. I was shocked. I've never been told this before at any other resort from Westin, Hyatt, Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. I said I would tell them but they are children and they may make noise. Needless to say we didn't stay long by the pool. I was not told at check in there were restrictions on children using the pool so I was confused by this comment by Jose. The next day I checked with the front desk and they did not know why Jose would tell us that and that children are allowed in the pool area as long as they are accompanied by an adult. The Manager-Hillary did leave me a nice message in our room apologizing for this but we never did get an answer as to why we were told this. That same day we spent several hours by the pool and there were other children jumping and splashing all over the pool so I really don't understand why Jose told us this. While I would recommend this resort I would probably choose a different hotel if we return with our children. It's a great place for adults and my husband and I would stay here again but without our children.","Apr 28, 2008","0","0",4,5,5,5,5,4,1,"4.5","$490"

"hotel_115","hotel_1127","A Perfect Romantic Getaway! My husband and I were looking for a great place for a Romantic getaway for 3 nights. After a lot of research of Phoenix and Scottsdale resorts, we choose Royal Palms mainly because it is more exclusive and smaller than the large resorts (the Phoenician is a couple of streets over). Especially after learning that it was spring break and many hotels were close to being 100% booked, I definitely didn't want to go to a place that was so booked that I would have to wait for everything, pool, gym, breakfast, valet. The Royal Palms makes you feel like you are among very few people and have alot of privacy. They have a very nice pool (just 1) and the staff throughout the hotels is very attentive and nice. The valet and bellmen are just wonderful, we never had to wait long to pick up or drop off our car. The front desk even printed out our boarding passes the day before we left, which we are so grateful of after seeing the enormous lines at the airport. We may have been late for the flight, in which case my husband would have yelled at me for since I am always running late!This is the kind of place for someone looking for privacy and doesn't care about having 3 pools and many loung bars through the hotel. It is a smaller hotel but that really is the beauty of it. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous with camelback mountain in the back drop. The hotel itself is mediteranean style with beautiful antique pieces throughout. The doorways each have so much character, they look as though they have been there for 100 years.The spa was lovely, we had a couple's massage followed by a botanical bath in a private room with a small terrace.

He seems to think it's just by accident we stay at places we do :)Anyway, stayed over Labor Day, and was positively giddy over mainly two things that stood out to me. One, the whole pool experience. The blond guy (I'm bad with names) was like a walking hand-book in steps of service. Flawless in other words. I do love the accomodating approach, one that he def. mastered (which could not be said for his sidekick). In 104 degrees heat, one would be dependent on the pool no?! I guess the different flavoured Pina Coladas didn't hurt either.The second wow-factor was owed to the food. Top notch, roomservice as well as in the restaurant (same kitchen, but that doesn't nec. guarantee anything). In particular we were hooked on some of the breakfast items, so much that we squeezed one in before our checking out, a last one...Other than that the grounds were very pretty. Ordinarily we would stay at smaller capacity hotels, not used to sharing lol. The first room we were offered must have been on top of a flight hangar, or the back of the restaurant turbines, same thing. But that was corrected immediately. We had booked a Designer Casita, which turned out to be quite spacious, with a sturdy bed.My only complaint was the standard of the bathroom. We had been warned at the time of booking that it would be a standard bathroom, but for the room level I don't think I've had such a basic bathroom ever.

"hotel_115","hotel_7950","Perfection I don't know where to start. This hotel is simply spectactular. I was a guest at the hotel in June 2007. Traveling to Arizona to attend a wedding, I first took a quick side trip to Tucson, to visit friends, and stayed at the Arizona Inn there. How disappointing! Beautiful grounds, great pool, but the room was mediocre, a bit tattered and worn, and overall did not measure up to the positive reviews I saw on tripadvisor, and which prompted me to book my stay there. So, my expectations were relatively muted when I made my way to Phoenix and Royal Palms. On entering the property, I was blown away by the stunning architecture and gardening. In the reservation desk area, they had a pitcher of tasty and refreshing pink lemonade (Lord knows it was certainly HOT!) and I was greeted warmly by the reservation agent. Here's where things started to get real good. Traveling in the off-season, I thought I'd secured a pretty good deal - I believe it was $150/night for one of their basic rooms. Well, without even asking, I was upgraded to one of the new Spa Suite rooms. When the bellboy took me to my room, and opened the door, I almost fainted. It was stunning! On entering the room, the sounds of soothing, acoustic music enveloped you. The lighting was just right, dim, and romantic. The first part of the room is a sitting area with a luxurious, turkish-like seatte, full of comfy pilows - across from that you had an impressive entertainment unit and a small wet bar area. In the center of the room was the most luxurious bath I've ever had the privilege of looking at, let alone, using! Deep, soaking tub, those bowl sinks that sit on top of the the vanity. A walk-in steam shower, lotions, shower gels, shampoo and conditioners that were heavenly! You then enter the bedroom, and it was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Just gorgeous. Dark stained wood floors. Two plasma tvs (one in the sitting area, another in the bedroom). And to top it off, a beautiful balcony that looked over a stunning courtyard area. One afternoon we were serenaded by a spanish guitartist. Pinch me - I must be dreaming!! Unfortunately, it was so daggone hot, I couldn't really take advantage of the balcony. Also, because I was running around a bit for wedding activities, a long day trip to the Grand Canyon and The Police concert the Monday before I left, I really didn't get to enjoy the room for my 4 night stay as much as I would have liked. But that just gives me an excuse to make a return trip - during a better -cooler - time of the year.Oh - and service. Talk about going the extra mile. I discovered that my credit card was missing from my purse. I couldn't find it anywhere. I wasn't sure if I'd dropped it while shopping or possibly in the car. Well, one of the valets did a painstaking search throughout my rental car and managed to find the card in a really obscure location. I guess it had fallen out of my purse while I was driving. I was so grateful for the time and effort this gentleman put into finding the lost item. Overall, service was exemplary throughout my stay.Royal Palms has spoiled me for life when it comes to hotel accomodations. I doubt there is a place that will ever measure up to my experience last summer. The surprise factor alone of getting such a beautiful room at a fraction of it's normal nightly rate is something I'll likely never experience again. In a nutshell, Royal Palms is simply amazing!! Or as one of my good friends likes to put it: All that and a bag of chips!!!You won't be disappointed...","Jan 20, 2008","3","3",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_7272","Royal Palms is Royal in every way! We've been to Royal Palms Resort 3 times now and I can't imagine staying anywhere else in the Phoenix area. I was there once with my daughter for her college spring break for the Ladies Fling, once with my husband for our anniversary and once as a family. This resort was great for all of these vacations. It is small which is a refreshing change from staying at huge hotels. It was pricey, but worth saving up for. We were treated like royalty. I liked the resort fee concept which relieved us of having to worry about tipping the staff. Everyone working there seemed to truely enjoy their jobs. The rooms were luxurous in a tasteful comfortable way and we could enjoy our mornings and evenings on the patio right outside our room. The grounds and pool were gorgeous. If I had to find something that wasn't perfect it would be that they were short of pool chairs during peek swimming times, and some guests would stake them out for the entire day. However when we were at the pool we felt like we were really on vacation sipping our drinks delivered to us poolside. The spa was awesome and dining at the restaurant was truely a gourmet experience.

This dude more than took care of us throughout the stay (even if his wrist was having some issues). Quite frankly, I would return for the pool service alone.We stayed in a Casita which was awesome. Great little patio area that was perfect for reading the paper and enjoying a wake-up beverage in the morning. Bed very comforable and furnishings made you feel you were someplace special.Really enjoyed the T. Cooke's Sunday Brunch. Other meals there were also very good.

"hotel_115","hotel_3615","A really top class resort Stayed here just one night for a quick spa break with a girlfriend. The sales representative on the phone convinced me with her attitude and friendliness that this would be a good place for me and my friend, who was going through a tough time emotionally.It offers a great luxury alternative to big chain spa hotels. It is in a beautiful, historic setting that creates a much more intimate ambience. I would go back with my husband for a romantic weekend, definitely.It was beautiful, relaxing, and the service was excellent. Our room was huge, and although it overlooked the parking lot, still had a nice view, and was extremely comfortable. The beds were great, the bathtub was the size of a swimming pool.The grounds are absolutely lovely, and worth strolling round. The staff are really wonderful. Everyone knew our names, and made sure they pronounced them properly.The restaurant was excellent, food, service, value for money (surprisingly reasonable, considering it is very highly rated).The spa is a little small for the size of the hotel. As it was very cold during our stay, we couldn't enjoy all the outdoor areas. If it had been warmer we would have probably spent longer there. The indoor relaxation areas are very small, and only two showers, which seems a little odd.Only quibble with the room: poor lighting in the bathroom makes it hard for us middle-aged women to put on make-up!","Jan 2, 2008","3","3",5,6,5,6,5,6,4,"4.5","$490"

We also ate dinner at the resort which was superb. The bar is very popular and has two fireplaces and inviting spaces. When they offer the wine tasting in the bar, do it.

"hotel_115","hotel_2062","We had a great time We just came back from a lovely weekend at the Royal Palms. We were visiting family, so knew that we would spend a fair amount of time away from the resort. Therefore we did not book one of the higher priced rooms. Still, we enjoyed our room, and our stay immensely. We were in the Valencia Casita (number 153). Generally we were pleased with the room, although the bathroom is definitely in need of updating. The plumbing wasn't great, and there were ants in the sink! (not a big deal, but they were there!). Even though we went off property a fair bit, we still managed to enjoy much of what the Royal Palms has to offer. The lovely grounds, a great lunch at T Cooks (as well as breakfast both mornings). The fitness room is small, but reasonably well equiped, and there is a nice outdoor yoga studio that is a lovely place to excercise early in the morning before it's too hot. I think the spa is wonderful. The massage therapists are just excellent, and the facility is lovely. But, book right away as we had trouble getting a reservation.We've now stayed at a good number of the nice places in Phoenix/Scottsdale, including the Hermosa Inn (lovely, but very small, no fitness facility on site), the Sanctuary (overrated we thought, though the spa is excellent), the Phoenician (we like it a lot, though it is very big; great fitness facility/spa etc.), the Biltmore (also like it, but also big).After this visit, which was our second, we concluded that we would like to return. It just has a great feel.","Nov 5, 2007","5","3",6,5,6,5,5,5,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_7108","Not All It Is Cracked Up To Be! My husband and I just stayed at the Royal Palms Hotel to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary. Although the grounds are very beautiful, the rooms are romantic, and T. Cook's Restaurant and Lounge, and the service by the pool are all extraordinary, the business end of the hotel leaves QUITE A BIT TO BE DESIRED!When we arrived, our room was not ready and the person at the check-in desk said he would call within the hour to let us know what the status of our check in would be. When we had not received a phone call more than two hours later, we stopped by the front desk. The person did not seem to remember us, but another person at the desk asked if our phone number was on file and said that she would call. The second Royal Palms representative did call, and we ended up checking in about 3:30 pm (which is a 1/2 hour before the scheduled check-in time --even though I sent a request asking about an early check-in since I knew that we would be arriving around 10 am). Although we understand that our room was not ready early, I would have appreciated the call that the first representative said that he was going to make so that we could have made a better use of our afternoon. I was surprised that the room did not have a fireplace. I had called the property to inquire about fireplaces in the Deluxe Casitas (where we were booked), and was told that those rooms did have fireplaces; yet, we were placed in a room without one. The room was cozy, but I was looking forward to this particular amenity. On the second night of our stay, we had to call housekeeping to receive turn down service and request to have our towels changed. My biggest problem with the Royal Palms was the check-out/billing procedure. First, my minor issue. I had asked for our boarding passes to be printed (since that is a service that the Royal Palms offers), but the person at the front desk did not remember to give them to me until I asked. OK, a little oversight, but coupled with what followed, it just made the little oversight magnified.My major issue has to do with billing. First we were given the wrong bill (with someone who was charged about half what we paid per night for lodging). Then we were given our bill with three nights' charges for Rose Petal Turndown Service when we only had that service the first night. The Royal Palms check-out representative then deducted the subsequent two nights and informed us that we would receive an updated e-mail version of our bill before we were charged. I did not receive the e-mail version of the bill, but my credit card was charged for the total of the invoice I received upon departure and an additional amount. After calling the resort several times to speak with someone in accounting, I left a message asking someone to send me an updated (and corrected invoice with an explanation of any additional charges). When I received the e-mail with an updated copy of my bill there was ANOTHER FRAUDULENT CHARGE! I spoke with someone after receiving that invoice and she seemed a bit annoyed with my inquiries and requests to have the charges explained and removed.Finally, there were so many events being hosted at the Royal Palms (at least one every day of our visit), that the staff often seemed pulled away from their lodging guests. It seemed that during our stay there was not sufficient staff to address the needs of ALL guests, those lodging at the property and those hosting special events.For a property of this size, requesting what the Royal Palms requests per night for lodging, service should be seamless and all guests should feel like they are VERY special. We are not picky guests, if it were not for the abovementioned snafus, we would have never interacted with the Royal Palms staff since I had arranged all of our activities and dining options prior to arrival. In the event that the service is not seamless and the guests are not made to feel extra special, the property management should follow-up with guests to the best of their ability to explain the situation and offer some sort of compensation. I have traveled extensively for business and pleasure, and have stayed in large and small hotels where the management generally seemed to be concerned with the well-being of the guests. I did not feel that this was the approach at the Royal Palms Hotel.","Oct 16, 2007","16","10",3,5,5,4,3,3,1,"4.5","$490"

We took the opportunity to have breakfast at the only restaurant on the property -- T. Cook's. The breakfast was excellent and a great value. Our room was ready within the hour.We stayed in the hotel portion of the complex, there are also several private bungalows. Our room was spacious, quiet and comfortable.

"hotel_115","hotel_8309","Great for Romance, not to do Business - Robynne Reiber NYC After reading all the great reviews of this hotel, I decided it sounded just perfect for my one night in Scottsdale. I was finishing up a long and difficult week of traveling to several cities and thought doing my last day of business in a spa and resort would help chill me out. But, this place is for romance, for couples, for people who want to veg out at the spa and try to take themselves to another level. All I wanted was a computer connection that worked, to be left alone to write and lot of hot coffee. Not exactly a match made in heaven. Truthfully, I felt like I was living in an alternative universe where everyone just smiled and nodded and repeatedly asked me if I was having a fabulous time. W/hen my room wasn't ready and I had to wait 2 hours, the nice lady at the front desk suggested I get a hot stone message while I waited -- it would clear me out and help my writing. Then once I got into my room and was just falling into a nap during the only 2 hours I had to rest in my room before finishing up my business, someone knocked on my door, woke me up and offered me tea. Okay, so you get it. This place is gorgeous, the grounds manicured to within an inch of their life. The rooms are exceedingly comfortable and meant totally for romance. And, if this is you, please do come because you'll probably give it 5 stars like the many given in the past. But, if you have stress and have to produce work, stay away because, like me, you'll end up leaving more stressed and more on edge than when you entered.","Sep 13, 2007","9","8",4,5,5,5,4,3,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_3453","Everytime is perfect! I have stayed here since 1999 and I think it just gets better every time we come in to town. Service is top notch, the food is excellent and the rooms of course are beautiful with a great view. Nice quality mattresses, linens, and amenities. The service is comparable to the Beverly Hills Hotel. An example is: we asked about a restaurant and they brought reviews to us; and when we decided to dine there, they made reservations and printed a map. Everything was waiting in an envelope when we went to get our car for the evening. We are treated so well, weather we are in a smaller summer discount room or a suite in March for spring training. The employees of The Royal Palms Inn will go out of there way to assist you to the best of their ability, we did not hear 鈥渘o鈥?with out a very valid reason; and they came up with alternatives. I highly recommend this place to relax and be pampered.","Sep 9, 2007","1","1",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_3716","shy of perfection I had always heard good things about the Royal Palms (and, obviously, judging from the comments here it has many loyal followers), so I was looking forward to a weekend stay with my wife -- at a nice offseason rate. As many satisfied guests have noted, the property is initimate, well-groomed, historic, romantic (part of its schtick is to promote romance), and an utterly refreshing change from the mega resorts like the Biltmore and Phoenician which are nearby on Camelback. These are high points, along with the good service and friendly staff. However, we thought it didn't quite live up to our expectations. And, frankly, I'm a bit surprised at the surfeit of 5s in the tripadvisor ratings. The Royal Palms is good...but that good? We had a designer casita room which we thought was a bit dark and maybe a bit too in-your-face with a romantic furnishing (to be fair, this is the theme of the place). The bathtub in our room was mundane. Just a tub. But it had a huge walk in shower (with only one head). Far better, we thought, if the tub were a two-person jacuzzi tub and the shower more routine (to stick with the romance theme). The room had two patios, but the back patio was small, the walls were high, there was no planting or other vegetation. It was quite claustophobic. And the larger front patio -- where we did sit and eat breakfast one morning -- was not especially private. People could walk right by, within feet of our table (there were curtains we could pull across...but that just made it less scenic). Our room also was noisy. The AC was noisy, but most of all there was a constant running of water, like a toilet or shower was running next door. Maybe it was unique to this room -- Room 105 -- because we were at the end of a row of casitas and near the kitchen (could it have been kitchen plumbing?). Overall, the room seemed very nice and pretty but not luxurious by any means. Incidentally, these designer casitas are on the west side of the property and a bit isolated from the other rooms and casitas. You should ask to be on the east side -- you'll be closer to the pool and spa too. Finally, to our minds, one drawback was the lack of public rooms. Yes, I know, this is a boutique kind of establishment and I guess the expectation is that guests will walk the grounds or hole up in their rooms, but a couple of indoor public spaces would have been nice. The lobby here is not big -- just a check-in area. And when it's 110 outside, the outside sitting areas are not always comfortable.Call me a nitpicker, but it wasn't a perfect 5, at least if judged against other properties that try to reach the same customer base and at the same price range. But I have no problem recommending it as a sweet alternative to the big resorts -- especially if you are looking for a special romantic kind of getaway.","Sep 4, 2007","3","2",4,5,5,5,5,6,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_9888","Upsetting start, great place overall My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary. I booked back in June for a Montevista Terrace Suite. When we arrived we were taken to our room. Seemed like the last room on their lot. We were told they chose this for us due to extra privacy. When I walked in I knew right away it wasn't what I had requested. I asked what was going on and our bellman (Chris) contacted the front desk. Turns out they overbooked so they gave us a higher end room. My wife and I rarely complain but in this situation I was upset that they didn't tell me this up front. I looked out our lone window and saw a fence and whatever business is next door and their vehicles. Could not see CamelBack. Spent 1 hour trying to get the front desk to cooperate and they eventually moved us to a designer casita. Very nice. Still not what I originally requested but a very nice place. Later that evening there was a knock at our door and a food and beverage gentleman came in w/ a tray of truffles. There were 3 plates and 3 cards on this tray. He left 1 card and plate w/ us. It was an apology. You would expect a place like this to at least hide the fact that they have made several mistakes, seemed too routine. Maybe the last stop he made was the most genuine. I don't want to bash Royal Palms as it was a very impressive place as was the everyday service. As everyone else has stated, Rick, Jose, and Kevin are solid down by the pool. All of the valet make you feel special. T-Cooks in my opinion is overrated. We went to Houston's the 2nd night and Roy's the 3rd night. Roy's we had 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 beer, 2 glasses of wine, and dessert for about $20 less than 1 appetizer and 2 average meals at T-Cooks.We did see some of the other resorts and just from the appearance Royal Palms blows them away. We will definitely return.***keep the privacy door hanger outside, the maid service will knock on it 5 times during the day.","Sep 3, 2007","4","3",5,6,6,6,5,6,6,"4.5","$490"

I really liked the warm spanish design of the room interior. The big walking closet was convenient. The bedding sheet was so smooth that I enjoyed my sleep. The bed curtain was pretty.The gardens were very nice. I enjoyed them everytime I walked outside. The bar and restaurant were great. I especially enjoyed Sunday branch buffet. There were 2 buffet prices. One for $19.99 and the other for $29.99. $19.99 buffet was buffet only. $29.99 includes the buffet and one order from the branch menu. The menu for the buffet and branch was sort of difficult to understand this system. It does not state clearly what these prices include. The buffet was excellent. I was already full with the meal so I didn't a room to taste all the deserts unfortunately. There were several kind of deserts, which looked refined. I ate only one desert, which was a rapsberry square cake. It was a small one in a big plate. It had a tangy strong rapsberry taste and I personally liked it much. The buffet was so beautiful that I feel like going back to Phoenix only for that.The steam room and juccuzi bath were located in Alvadora spa, but they were free to use anytime from 8am - 8pm. They will give you a locker room key.Parking was all convenient vallet parking.Only downsizing was that I had several mosquito bites in the room and outside of the room.Overall, it was a great hotel and and I enjoyed my 3 nights!","Sep 1, 2007","3","3",6,5,6,6,6,5,6,"4.5","$490"

The drinks from the pool cabana are so good. Ask Rick or Jose to make you a raspberry Royale, it's not on the menu, so you have to request it.We had lunch at the pool cabana. No bar burgers and fries here. It was gourmet! I had a turkey wrap that was so fresh. My husband had a sirloin burger with a cheese we had never heard of. Very good! We also had breakfast at T. Cooks. Again, very fresh. The service was top notch. Anything you needed was at your fingertips if you asked. The bellmen and valets would not accept tips. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and because it was in July in Phoenix, the price was exceptional. One last thing to note. The hotel has a lot of history. It was originally a home that has been renovated over the years. Camelback Mountain provides a beautiful view behind the hotel. My husband and I hiked it early one morning.

"hotel_115","hotel_3867","Really nice, but some confusing aspects.... If you are looking for a small, classy, intimate, beautiful resort, this is it. The grounds and public areas are stunning. There are cool little nooks and crannys where you can relax in peace. My favorite thing is to see all the hummingbirds buzzing around in the early evening. I haven't seen a casita or a suite--I've only stayed in a regular room here. I stayed in a room in the 200's on this trip. The room wasfine, especially the bath, which is opulent and wonderful. The closetin the room is small, and there's no real dresser drawers. There's coffee in the room--French press style, which is great--and a fridge that doesn't charge you if you accidently pick up an item. The rooms are a little dark, but you can fully open the blinds for more light. The only thing that perplexed me on this stay was the refilling of the mini-fridge and the coffee. They give you enough in-room coffee for one use--but I was there for almost 3 days. I figured the maid service would replenish it, but no. So I called the front desk, and someone brings me a bunch of loose coffee in a drinking glass with plastic over it.????Also, I drank all the bottled water in the mini-fridge the first day,but it was never replenished. Again, I called to request it be replenished, and they brought me some huge glass bottles of Evian from the restaurant.???Also, my room did have a small ant problem, over by the chairs. I got bit on the toe by one, and now the itching is driving me crazy. But when you are in Phoenix, these things happen. Overall, I would stay here again, most definitely. It's great to be in a place that is essentially free of screaming children. For that reason alone, I'd go back.

All the staff were fantastic here, but have to mention the guys at the Cabana Pool Bar! We had iced water that was constantly being topped up, cold flannels given to us to keep us cool! We were really well looked after. (Could so get used to that lifestyle!!!) The Hotel grounds are beautiful and all the small villas are set amongst the gardens. We stayed in one of the villas when we returned and they are great, although we did prefer our first room which was a Montivista Terrace room. They are the newest rooms in the resort and are fitted out beautifully, gorgeous sunken bath and THE most comfiest bed i have ever slept in!!! T Cooks the restaurant on the resort is fantastic! Have to reccomend the Pork Belly! Gorgeous! We will definatley be returning to the Royal Palms again one day. Just wish it was today!!!Alaina  Wes.

"hotel_115","hotel_1463","Nice  I arrived at the resort at 5pm on Saturday for a overnight getaway. Upon arrival, everyone greeted me and my fiance and was very nice to us. We were checked in quickly and lead to our room which was part of their Montavista Collection. After looking at their website just now, I'm not sure if that was the room I was booked in so I'll have to contact them about that. The casita I stayed in was beautiful. The bed was nice and comfortable, even though my fiance complained of bedbugs, I think they were insect bites from us laying out on the hammocks or sitting outside on the patio area of our room. The pool area is small but there only a few people out there when we visited the bar area that services the pool. The staff at the bar were polite and chit chatted with us about the city and its surroundings. I did not eat at T. Cooks because reservations were needed but I did order room service which was okay. They could offer a better variety of food but again, no complaints. I did not visit the spa either, and probably wouldn't no matter how long my stay was. It is severly overpriced. I would visit again and recommend this resort over a lot of the other resorts in Phoenix because its more intimate, better for couples or honeymooners.","Jun 18, 2007","3","1",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_9201","What a beauty!!!!! Choose local transportation wisely however. We found a last minute deal on the hotels' website which was over a $100 less than normal advertised rates (expedia, etc). I called the hotel directly and they said they were publishing them that day so, always check with the hotel.Hotel looked beautiful on the website but I expected it to be old and........... musty. It wasn't, it was absolutely perfect from the staff to the room to the grounds you could not ask for more.You could wander around the grounds without even seeing anybodyelse and it was more like being a guest in a beautiful spanish home than a hotel. Pool was busy as it was a holiday w/end but poolstaff super attentive, 5 star service.The only gripe we had was the transportation. The first night we ordered a taxi and a limo pullled up, we thought it was complimentary-nice. It wasn't . Although a little more expensive than a taxi (depending on the driver) we felt a bit ripped off.Turns out we couldn't get a taxi from the hotel without waiting almost 30-40 mins so we had to use the limo service (who were always at the hotel and always charged a diferent price) for the w/end. So, if you don't have a car use 'Discount Taxi' and just call at least half hour before as the taxis are not allowed to wait at the hotel.We ate at T.Cooks hotel restaurant food not bad, not great atmosphere-wonderful!Also, loved the in room kettle and cafetiere, never seen this in a hotel and what a difference a nice 'cuppa' makes before you get out of bed.","Jun 2, 2007","4","2",6,6,5,6,6,6,6,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_8659","Relaxing Vacation! Just returned from 4 nights at the Royal Palms for a girls weekend with a friend from another state. What a wonderful, relaxing time we had! We loved the Royal Palms and the service was excellent. It is such a beautiful, quiet resort and the pool was so refreshing and we enjoyed just relaxing and enjoying the perfect Arizona weather. We went to the spa and had massages and pedicures, did Yoga and Pilates, enjoyed T. Cook's restaurant one night , room service, and just enjoyed the gardens, fountains and general atmosphere of the hotel. One day we didn't even bother to leave the hotel all day. Can't wait to go back! The only issue we had was we had booked a room through Expedia and requested 2 double beds. When we arrived we were told they had no more rooms with 2 double beds and were given a king suite with one bed and a pull out couch in the living room. Well, neither of us wanted to pay $300 per night to sleep on a pull out couch (and that's a bargain compared to their normal prices!) so we made do with the king size bed. They had told us the first night that we could move to a different room with 2 beds the next day. When we went to the office the next morning we were told by some different people that there were no rooms available that day and we could move the next day. Well, that was half way through our trip and it was getting rather annoying. The girl at the front desk did not seem to be too accommodating and said that was the best she could do. I asked to speak to the Manager and she informed me she was the Manager. Anyway, by that afternoon she did come through for us and upgraded us to a Spa Suite (still with the king size bed) with our own private patio overlooking a courtyard with fountains. I was also informed that all rooms do not come with a patio or balcony or a safe as they had indicated on their website. She told me I was mistaken in reading that, so if you want that you better call ahead and verify exactly what you are getting. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend the Royal Palms if you can afford it. The guys at the pool were wonderful and we enjoyed the pool side restaurant every day for lunch. Their lemon ice water is the best , along with the ice cold towels they brought out to our chaise lounge in the sun. What a treat - we felt so pampered and spoiled!","May 30, 2007","1","1",5,6,6,6,5,6,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_4107","Loved it! The treasure hunt was really good fun! My husband and I stayed at the Royal Palms for a few days and we really enjoyed our stay! We have never been to Arizona before and we didn't know what to expect. The resort has a Spanish feel with lovely foundtains and gardens. The room/suite was spacious and nice, though the bathroom was quite small in comparison. The pool was small, but it was nice enough, and we didn't have any problem getting the sunbeds. We also tried the spa, which was plesant though nothing spectacular. The best part of the resort was activites that went on and the service. We were encouraged to play the treasure hunt game and every staff was very helpful in directing us/ giving us hints. We also did stargazing with a huge telescope in the garden which was quite amazing. Overall, we thought the Royal Palms was a real gem, it is not a huge luxurious resort with golf course and 6 swimming pools, but it is a relaxing and boutique-ish resort with very good service and amenities.","May 25, 2007","5","3",5,5,5,5,5,6,1,"4.5","$490"

Our room had a front and back patio area, a fireplace and was beautifully appointed. As always the grounds and pool areas were lovely, surrounded by fragrant flowering plants and always the backdrop of Camelback Mountain.. Service at the front desk and by the pool was attentive and professional. We dined at T Cooks for dinner one night and the food and wine was excellent and service there was also outstanding. Overall, this is a very high end hotel with the feel of a boutique inn.

"hotel_115","hotel_10353","Royal Palms Hospitality We stayed at this property for the last night of our week in Arizona celebrating our wedding. We had spend the previous 6 nights in Sedona and had two reasons for staying here for the night.First reason was it reduced our drive time on our day of departure, Sedona is over 100 from PHX Airport, where as Royal Palms is an easy 15 - 20 minute drive.Second reason was that many friends and colleagues in the industry had spoken highly of this property.The hospitality was extremely good, everyone was very professional. The resort fee included all Bell and Valet gratuities which we thought was great, and the service was top notch. Over all the feeling was very high end, the atmosphere attractive, and the staff paid attention to all of the little details that every property wishes all of their staff would pay attention to.Honestly our trips to Arizona are mostly leisure and take us to the Sedona area, but we would consider making a special trip to spend an extra day or two at this property, we really want to use the spa next time, our brief tour looked really good.","Apr 24, 2007","0","0",6,6,5,6,5,6,6,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_6935","No place to hang your clothes!!!!!!!!! My wife and I love this hotel, the grounds, the staff, but not the rooms. It's our second visit and we will definately return. Both of our visits were over Easter and both were for a week.My title to this review is to hopefully get the attention of someone in Royal Palms management who can address my only complaint; NO PLACE TO PUT YOUR CLOTHES!At over $400 per night, you don't really want to live out of your suitcase, but Royal Palm provides no dresser, no chest of drawers, only two small one drawer nightstand, and no hooks or towel rack in the bathrooms. (Your towels are rolled and place on the counter.)No hook anywhere for your wet bathing suit or PJ's, or whatever you are wearing while in the bathroom. Just the cold marble floor!The good news on my last visit (4/07) was that we were upgraded to a small suite, the bad news is that it must have been a handicap-only room as the bar in the only closet in the space was lowered for wheelchair access. (Room 313, if my memory serves me correctly.) So, no long hang ability for the ladies. I don't remember if that was the problem in 4/06, but I do remember our room also had no convenient place to put your clothing. My wife had to hang her fancy dress on a the drapery rod.The grounds and Camelback vistas are picture postcard perfect, the food service at the pool is fantastic and all you need, the pool staff (Rick and Jose) are so good they were the biggest reason we returned again.MPJ","Apr 15, 2007","2","2",4,3,6,6,6,6,5,"4.5","$490"

"hotel_115","hotel_9767","An amazing place! 1) We were on a business trip, so our room was paid for by the company, thank goodness! Otherwise, I admit the room prices are a bit much.2) Most comfortable bed we ever slept on. In fact, we pulled the bedding off so we could see which company made the mattress! Came back home and got one for our own bedroom. So comfy!3) Scenery was amazing. I took so many photos of the hotel grounds themselves! The best surprise was all the citrus trees filled with fruit.4) Amazing outdoor fireplaces to sit around, which was lovely in December. We also enjoyed our dinner at the restaurant outside. They put large heaters to keep us comfortable.5) We stayed in a Valencia Suite, which was wonderful when my husband had to get up early for meetings. He could get ready and watch the news while I slept in our amazing bed.6) Our living room opened to a lovely courtyard with sitting areas and outdoor fireplaces. Our bedroom opened to a patio where we had a room-service breakfast one morning. Both sides had a view of Camelback Mountain which was gorgeous.7) I visited the spa, which was lovely. One of the nicest I've been to. Again, the company treated the spouses to 2 spa treatments each. (Yes, we were spoiled!)8) Not much around the hotel, but I did take a walk in the neighborhood behind it and it was quite a hike up a HUGE hill. But honestly we were content to stay at the Royal Palms and enjoy the grounds.

"hotel_115","hotel_4892","Amazing weekend get-away I don't even know where to begin! My mother, sister and I met for a girl's weekend get-away from 2/9-2/12 at the Royal Palms and we couldn't have picked a more perfect place. We were looking for a nice, relaxing place where we could spend time together (we live in 3 different states across the country from each other). The resort is absolutely beautiful, the rooms are outstanding, and the spa was beyond words. We were told at check-in that the resort was fully committed, yet we felt almost as if we were the only ones there! Our casita consisted of a living room, bedroom and large bathroom - more than enough room for the 3 of us to comfortably relax. We also had a patio that overlooked a lovely courtyard area that had a fountain and several wood fireplace pits. They were lit on Friday night but not the others, which was a little disappointing. However, I'm sure that had we asked to have them lit, it would have been done right away!! We ate dinner outside of the resort 2 evenings but did enjoy T. Cook's on Saturday night. Overall, it was lovely but the service could have been better. We did feel as if the waitress could have been friendlier and more involved in our dining experience (as opposed to just serving us food). The fitness center and spa were excellent. I enjoyed two treatments at the spa and they were phenomenal - worth every penny. I would like to comment on one event that happened during our stay that explains why the Royal Palms is royal in my book....during her massage, my mother and her massage therapist were talking about where we had eaten the night prior and my mom commented that we had eaten at T. Cook's. She asked my mom what she had for dinner and my mom told her the duck. She asked her if she enjoyed it and my mom said yes, but that it had been a little dry. They went on to discuss other things and my mom didn't think anything of the conversation. When we all got back to the room, we received a call from the front desk advising us that the duck was going to be removed from bill!! What a surprise, especially when it's not expected. It's things like this that make you feel like you are a guest that is truly cared about.All in all, the Royal Palms is the nicest place I have ever stayed. It is not really for children and it's not for the die hard partier looking for night life entertainment. It's definitely better suited for the romantics or those looking to de-stress and be pampered. It's going to be hard staying anywhere else after my time at the Royal Palms!!","Feb 13, 2007","8","8",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4.5","$490"

The staff was courteous, cheerful, and overall very good.The pool was closed for renovation during our stay, but the RP was offering free shuttle service to the Phoenician pool. We did not feel like swimming, so this did not bother us one bit, but I thought it was a nice touch to accomodate those who wanted to swim. The Alvadora Spa was great. We had a couples massage and it was worth every penny. We left the spa feeling very relaxed-they do a great scalp massage along with the regular swedish massage for no extra charge.Dinner at T. Cook' s was good, but I would not call it exceptional. The service was average.The last thing that I MUST share is that I had arranged to have breakfast delivered to our room ahead of time and it arrived promptly, however, we were due for our spa appointments because we had overslept. So, I asked if they would re-heat our food when we got back from the spa. They said they would not do such a thing. They re-cooked our ENTIRE breakfast and had it waiting for us hot and fresh when we returned from our spa appointment!!!

The restaurant is phenomenal. The waiters and all of the staff were very knowledgable and affable. I don't know why people are complaining about the resort fee.

"hotel_115","hotel_6014","Birthday getaway in April I took my husband to the Royal Palms for a birthday getaway from a Th-Monday. I had researched many resorts and had narrowed my choices to the Lake Austin Spa Resort and the Royal Palms. The Royal Palms was clearly a more interesting destination with options outside of the resort that were endless, so I chose it. I booked through Expedia and while the RP was either the most expensive or 2nd most expensive choice in the PHX/Scottsdale area, it seemed to be the best fit. The descriptions on this site and at the RP website indicated it's small and personal feel and service, which was appealing. The website won me over with the awards list and the beautiful photos, especially those showing it's proximity to Camelback Mtn. I booked the package (air and hotel) well in advance- at least 4 months and figured I would begin making spa, restaurant and excursion reservations about one month out. Long story short, it is very important to call in advance (as soon as you book would be best) in order to get your preferred times to dine at T. Cooks for dinner (breakfast and lunch res. not required) and especially at the spa. The times I had asked for intitially were unavailable, even one month in advance. Also, when you speak to someone, take their name and then call again a few weeks before your trip to confirm your appts. It was all worked out before we arrived and we were welcomed with fabulous service, but I felt like most of that was due to my frequent contact beforehand. Be sure plan ahead if you stay at the RP...your trip will only be worth the expense if you plan each detail so as not to miss out on all of the opportunities and inclusions in staying here. The only reasons I did not give this resort a full 5 are: Although the resort does not claim to be adults only, all of the reviews and even the RP website alludes to this. We were there during a insurance broker's conference and many brokers had brought their children with them. While this was only a minor issue, it is worth noting that at a resort with a pool area that is so intimate, children's voices (even joyful ones) carry and tend to interfere slightly with the romantic and peaceful atmosphere.Even when you book ahead of time, the charges in the spa are a) never the same as what you saw online or were quoted and b) always seemingly random (literally as if the numbers were simply drawn from a lottery) and WAY over-priced. Check your bill carefully. If you speak to someone in charge, they will correct the bill, but it will be time consuming. The spa is fabulous and while I am willing to pay $500 a night for a room, paying more than $150 for a very standard 60 minute massage is ridiculous. Thinking that I would have been disappointed with only one day at the spa, I booked two mornings full of spa activities and services on the 2nd and 4th days of our stay. If I could do it all over again, I would simply ask for the 90 minute massage (confirm the price in writing ahead of time) and leave the spa treatments to that. This was worth every penny. The 60 minute massage and manicure were overpriced and not nearly relaxing or enjoyable enough to justify the price. I found myself anxious the entire time I should have been enjoying these treatments b/c I knew that I was spending hundreds of dollars on something that had less than $100 of value to me. On the last day we stayed, a motley crew of people that looked as if they belonged in a trashy music video took over the pool. They ordered grey goose and champagne as if it were going out of style (beginning before noon) and played their loud music and smoked their cigarettes while dancing their scantily clad bodies around the pool. They even brought their yapper of a dog to run around wildly and bother the guests. While these folks obviously had paid (on credit no doubt) for the two cabanas they inhabited it didn't matter b/c the size of the pool and area were only modestly larger than a large residential pool. Please also keep in mind that the past few days (while many children had been present) were quite peaceful and the pool had only been visited by folks with similar interests (sunbathing, having maybe 1 or 2 drinks and lunch and enjoyng the peaceful and romantic atmosphere). While Rick was fab. by asking them to keep quiet and not physically invade the other guest's space, there was nothing he could do but keep bringing them their drinks and grin and bear it. Needless to say, we did not stay at the pool more than 5 minutes on our last day, which was disappointing. I am not sure how the RP could have prevented this occurance, but I am shocked that those sorts of people chose the RP for their party. It certainly was not a good match!THANKS are deserved! The special touches at the RP are what makes it worth the cost. While you could stay at the Bellagio for less, no one there will remember your name, which pool chair you like or whether you prefer red or white. You certainly won't be receiving personally signed notes at the beginnning and end of your stay, nor rose petal covered bedding or chocolate covered strawberries as a surprise at turn-down. The staff was superb and especially gracious and friendly. The grounds are beautiful. The food and service are great. The suite is worth the extra $- having the extra room is great for couples with different sleeping habits.TIPS: Place a personal item on a pool chair early in the morning to get your preferred spot. (The sun is strong, so be sure to wear sunscreen at all times.) Be sure to go to Camelback Mtn. for a few hikes- the ones recommended in the brochure are great- for all levels. Sunset horsesback riding is highly recommended. While the crowd you'll be with for 4 hours isn't the classiest, the views are breathtaking. Go to arizona-horses for one option. Skip the shopping, especially if you live in a more metropolitan area. T. Cooks is as good as any restaurant off site, so if I had it to do again I would have dined there each evening I was interested in a more formal meal. For informal, do a steakhouse or cookout with the horseback riding and be sure to check out Pizza Bianco. The Bar Bianco and Pizza rest. are well worth the wait. It is such a cute set-up on a lovely evening. Also, you'll be right next to the stadium, so you can check that out, too. If you decide to rent a car (which you don't need to do unless you plan to leave the resort more than once per day), def. do the convertible. We did and did not regret it.","Apr 24, 2006","21","14",4,5,1,5,1,6,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_5240","Breathtaking! What a lovely experience we had at the Royal Palms. I have never seen a more beautiful property. The air smelled sweet and flowers were blooming everywhere you turned. Walks through the property led you to discover wonderful little secret gardens and courtyards everywhere. It is hard to believe the previous review stating they walked ten minutes to the front desk. It doesn't take ten minutes to get anywhere at Royal Palms. Yes the pool is small but that was one of the things I loved. I hate large overcrowded resort pools with worn chairs and no personal service or ambiance. I do understand that some rooms are better than the others but the purpose of darker rooms is to give you a respite from the hot Arizona sun. It is to give the best of both worlds. Beautiful, bright exterior and cool and calm interiors. We all must take some responsibility when we travel and do as much research as possible. It is very clear everywhere you read that the hotel restaurant T. Cooks is well known and reservations are strongly recommended in advance. If you are a fan of big, trendy resorts with 3 pools and many restaurants with rooms that all look the same then this hotel is not for you. But if you are looking for a magical, romantic, quiet getaway with the grace of a fine european inn then Royal Palms is the place.","Apr 12, 2006","7","5",5,6,1,6,1,5,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_1155","Windows wouldn't open, view of hall and air conditioning machines This is the prettiest horrible hotel I have ever been to. Possibly the casitas in the old section are what gives it its rating. We did not see one.Our corner Plaze suite was BIG and an extremely long walk through two courtyards (my heart began sinking when I saw the first courtyard. I had an idea what we were in for as I saw open windows and the people in the rooms and closed windows along the dark halls I was walking in). The door to our room opened to a large, lovely living room with loud, admittedly pretty, stereo music greeting us. All blinds were closed, here and in the bedroom which adjoined. When I opened them, I realized why - The bedroom looked out on the air conditioning system - six huge compressors. I tried to open the window - not a chance!The living room looked out on a dark hall and blank wall with a table against it to stop the eye. Those windows didn't open either. We were in sunny Arizona with no way of breathing the air unless we propped our door open and craned our necks to see some sun and sky. When we turned the stereo down we could hear the roar. Even when we left it on, as we did all night, there was still a strange high-pitched noise we could not obliterate.I walked the 10 minute walk back to the front desk, with a wonderfully patient bellman working his second job while trying to get a real estate license, to ask for a different choice. My husband, who had just broken his elbow horseback riding, waited. I was told I had booked the new Plaza area. I had never been told the difference. The only other available room, I was told, was a deluxe room (no living room, which might have been OK with me in exchange for air) so we went to look. That had a balcony, and an opening door, overlooking...the parking lot.I didn't bother trying other choices. Actually, supposedly there were none. There were rooms that looked across a courtyard at other rooms. Not much of a choice. If your room faced the road and the hall, the other option, your windows did'nt open because it would be too noisy. We actually could still hear the cars through the fan vent in the bathroom ceiling.As mentioned in other letters, the pool is too crowded. The restaurant was fully booked for dinner when we got there, but no one had suggested when I reserved a room that I also reserve for dinner. In a way, we turned out to be lucky as it was mostly closed in like the rooms.I could go on as our daughter and her husband and two sons, for whom I had also booked a room, had sililarly difficult experiences.What did I learn? Always ask if the windows open. Just because American Express says it's a Fine Hotel, don't believe it! Don't believe the pictures. Saving grace, our room faced east and a lovely sunrise wakened us.","Apr 7, 2006","12","6",2,6,1,6,1,5,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_2938","a wonderful place! My husband and I recently stayed at the Royal Palms for 5 nights in one of the plaza suites. We received great service from everyone at the resort, and also had a great dinner at the resort's restaurant T. Cooks. We loved the smaller feel of this resort, compared to other populart Scottsdale resorts we visited like The Phoenician (for drinks) and the Biltmore (for brunch). The grounds are absolutely beautiful, and perfect for a romantic getaway. I didn't see too many kids/families there by the pool, mostly couples or groups of adults relaxing. We also each had a treatment at the spa, and enjoyed them both. We're not spa-addicts, so we can't compare it to many other places, but everthing was very professional and relaxing.

"hotel_115","hotel_5139","Royal Palms, Not Our Old Standby anymore! Well, all good things must come to an end. So be our EIGHT YEAR run at the Royal Palms Resort in Phoenix. We thought about changing our annual hotel destination this year, 2006 but decided, why change something that has usually been good? Well, we found out why. The front desk staff needs some training and they need to learn how to treat a guest who has been a faithful to their hotel for this many return visits. First, our room choice had been requested for a month prior to our trip...then on the day of arrival a very specific room was asked for and was available, only to be given away 5 minutes before we were given our room, after we waited all day for the room to be cleaned etc. Then we were told no roll aways anymore...all of our previous visits we have had one. So this was an issue this year... new rule.That was a problem since the hotel was sold out for the night. We were unable to have beds for all guests in our room, then the staff was not accomodating in finding an alternative. They offered The Ritz, which is not a Resort/Spa. We had to find our own alternative accomodations at 10 p.m. Friday night and it basically ruined our evening and the next day as we had to check out and move the next day although moving to the PHOENICIAN was a Pleasant one. WE have always had problems with the bills being incorrect at Royal Palms (we did for our one night too!) and the pool service, they had one nice guy at the RP taking care of the entire pool, when they knew they were entirely booked at their hotel. He was overworked and a little cranky! but we understood his plight. We just dont spend that kind of money to relax for a weekend away to be treated so poorly and with such disrespect for our vacation time. We will definitely be writing to the Royal Palms to let them know their returning guests will be no longer...not that they care! We will be happy to go to the Phoenician where our rooms were large and spacious with superb, expediant service in every arena of the hotel. They may be a little larger, but wow, the service there is impeccable. p.s. No maid service was knocking on doors at 8:30 on a weekend morning at the Phoenician, like at the Royal Palms...they need a few lessons on luxury accomodations..As we were checking out of the RP, we noticed a lovely older couple who were wondering why they did not have the Casita they had reserved 6 months in advance...they were very upset as well...They were heading to the Four Seasons!We will definitely not go back, too many other mishaps to list.

"hotel_115","hotel_5717","Loved this Place - one of the best hotels at which I've stayed My wife and I just completed a 4 night stay at the Royal Palms Resort in Phoenix and loved it. We were in town for a wedding, but by staying at the Royal Palms we were able to make the wedding more of a mini vacation for us. Our first night we stayed in a regular room at the hotel, as the Casitas (which we had wanted) were full. The room was very nicely decorated, perhaps a bit small, but overall very nice. The staff was awesome - friendly, responsive, and always willing to help. On the next day, we moved to a deluxe casita, with a fireplace, which was a very nice room (though a bit pricey at $500+ per night...). We loved our stay - the concierge was great, the staff helpful, the pool service very good (and friendly - thanks Rick!) and the spa also wonderful. Perhaps the only minor disappointment was our dinner at T. Cooks, which stated off with rather chaotic service but which improved with our dinner - though still not up to the standards at the overall resort. I'd clearly go back again - and would recommend this hotel (if you're willing to pay their rates..) to others without reservation.","Jan 23, 2006","9","6",4,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4.5","$490"

Tucked in the dusty foothills of Camelback Mountain, the Royal Palms is an oasis of historic palm trees, lush gardens, vibrant lawns, mosaic fountains, and reflecting pools. The entire experience appeals to all senses...the mourning doves cooing, the gentle breeze carrying orange blossom perfume, the cool mist from the poolside cabana, the decadent food from the exquisitely appointed restaurant and lounge. Mom and I went for a Girls Weekend and indulged in Alvadora spa treaments (Orange Blossom Body Buff and Aromatherapy Massage). The spa is hands-down (or hands-on) the most decadent, soul-refreshing, spirit-rejuvinating space in which I have ever had the pleasure of lounging. It's a study in catering to one's every whim. I could go on endlessly about the peppermint towels, the plunge pool, the private outdoor showers, but suffice it to say that we nearly melted in the joy of simply being there. The Royal Palms staff were infinitely helpful and friendly, and the turndown service with chocolates was just one of the many nice touches of this special inn.

I travel a lot for business and have stayed in some of the best resorts in the US. The Royal Palms ranks in my top 3. My laptop crashed before my meeting and concierge offered their IT services, as well as finding me a Data Drs. nearby. Even though it is a resort that most people go to to get away, they are well equipped for business travelers. Kris at the front desk recommended Daniel's - a small Italian restaurant just down Camelback. It was wonderful! I highly recommend it!Definitely book your spa appointment before you go - they book up very early - especially on Friday and Saturday. It is understandable why this is one of the top ranked spas in the US. The staff is very accomodating, the grounds are beautiful, the mediterranean decor is exquisite and the beds are soooo comfortable. One of the best nights sleep I've had on the road.

It's not as big as some of the other resorts in the area but is laid out so you'll always have plenty of beautiful things to look at. We stayed in their casitas which were wonderful, with gardens in the front and back. The staff was helpful and mostly very pleasant. The Alvador spa is a lovely place with a very warm staff. Book early as their appointments tend to fill up quickly. The pool is very nice but is smallish if the hotel is fully booked. T. Cooke's is a delicious restaurant for every meal of the day.

"hotel_115","hotel_6218","Very pretty hotel with nice service but average room I just returned from a weekend trip for business at the Royal Palms. I was put in regular room next to the road. The room had low ceilings, a small bathroom and no water pressure. The room was very dark because the main window looked out to the walkway to the other rooms so if you opened your blinds anybody in the hallway could look right in your room. Truely an awful setup. I also requested a king bed but was given two doubles instead. The beds were extremely comfortable but I don't like to travel and stay in a bed smaller than mine at home. I was told they would move me the next day but never contacted me so I didn't bother to switch. The tv was an old Zenith 25 inch with a dull picture. Also the towels were very small for a five star hotel. The pool was small and the lounge chairs all occupied. You had to wait for the pool guy to find you a chair once somebody left. It was a very quite and adult type area and not very good for children. On the positive side, the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and caring. The food at all the functions was great and the grounds are wonderful. The lobby is warm and inviting. Overall a lovely resort but the room was just so dark and depressing I'm not sure I would want to stay there again unless I could get a room in another location. I've stayed at most of the other upscale places in Scottsdale and the darkness of the room was a real turnoff. I also missed not having a golf course on the grounds. I would not bring my kids to this resort as it would be a real dissapointment for them compared to the Phoenician, Biltmore, Hyatt, or Princess.","Apr 18, 2005","12","9",4,4,1,6,1,6,1,"4.5","$490"
"hotel_115","hotel_1164","Relaxation for the Right Price The Royal Palms Resort was a restful and relaxing place to stay. The grounds were nice during the day and very romantic at night. I stayed in one of the Deluxe Casitas so my room had it's own fireplace. The staff was exceedingly polite and extremely helpful. The restaurant was Out-of Control fabulous! Great food! There is also interesting art to look at all over the grounds. However, I was told the hotel had been refurbished by Designers and it already felt a little warn and not really 5-star caliber. (That's why it looks better at night.) When compared to The Four Seasons or St. Regis, the Royal Palms will likely disappoint. Also, the pictures on the web-site look better than the real thing. The lighting in the bathroom was harsh and the layout of the bed relative to the fireplace was not well thought out. What's more, some of the bathroom fixtures/decor looked tacky-cheap and out-dated. The private terraces were not well integrated into the square rooms and seemed odd, even ugly. The good part is that the Royal Palms is much cheaper than 5-star hotels and that made it less disappointing.","Dec 15, 2004","6","4",4,3,1,4,1,5,1,"4.5","$490"

I would return to Phoenix just to stay here again. I was supposed to stay down the street at the Phoencian for a conference but they were booked and recommended the Royal Palms. I am so glad they did. After touring both properties I would only stay at the Royal Palms. It was much more intimate and private than the Phoenician which seemed more like a mall. The property was beautiful and amazingly private. The fitness center was just perfect. The pool was just the right temperature. The spa and massage was amazing. The best I have had. The masseuse told me he had done the Bush daughters the month before while they were there campaigning with their father. The restaurant was excellent! I would recommend not being on the ground floor or handicap room. My first night was this type of room and you are able to hear people above and the handicap-accessible shower is not very enticing. I asked to have my room changed and they did. I probably would have not been as pleased if they hadn't changed rooms since I was not told I was getting this type of room.

"hotel_115","hotel_2523","Like coming home only better... We just returned from spending the past week at the Royal Palms and there simply aren't enough good things to be said about our visit.From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by an amazingly friendly, warm and caring staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Our first contact was with Tony, one of the valet attendants, who opened our doors, introduced himself and thereafter, always knew us by name. (This was a trait of everyone we met on the property...it was as if we were staying with friends who always greeted us this way.) He took care of our luggage while we checked in and then gave us a tour of the property and then showed us to our room.We splurged on a deluxe casita and it was well worth it. The room was beautiful, but then again, what isn't beautiful at the Royal Palms? The only other place we have seen that was so completely visually appealing was a resort we stayed at in Tahiti. Obviously very different environments but beauty is beauty no matter where it's found. The entire property makes you feel like you are living in a lovely, watercolor painting. The colors of the buildings and flowers and artwork all make for a serene and soothing atmosphere which you find yourself melting into very quickly.The casita was beautifully decorated and very roomy. We had a private patio in the back with a view of Camelback Mountain. We had our own patio in the front as well (there are curtains you can let down to increase the feeling of privacy) where we sat and enjoyed the lovely evenings. The bathroom is a slice of heaven. The huge, walk-in shower with built-in, tiled seating is a spa treatment in itself. And the selection of soaps and lotions that are provided are wonderfully luxurious.We can't offer enough praise to everyone, and we mean literally EVERYONE, who works there. Everyone is so happy and I don't mean in a freakish Disney/Stepford way. It's as if everyone there is absolutely thrilled to be doing their jobs and in finding ways to make you feel content and welcome. We never heard a raised voice, saw a scowling face or felt as if we weren't the most important guests there.The food in the restaurants is wonderful if just a little pricey but then again, you're paying for unsurpassed quality and service. T. Cook's serves marvelous meals and the Cabana Grill has wonderfully casual lunches (and breakfast brunch on Sundays) and poolside drinks. The poolside service is unsurpassed and again, Rick and Jose (I can't say enough good things about the two of you either!!!) make you feel as if you're visiting their home. And by the joy they demonstrate when doing their jobs, it's no wonder you feel that way.We didn't use the spa but we visited the boutique area and it was beautiful as well and also well stocked with a wide assortment of spa products.On our last night there, we had the privilege of attending the General Manager's reception in the Presidential Villa (where President Bush had stayed just 2 weeks prior...regardless of your politics, it's pretty cool to know you're standing in the bedroom where a world leader has recently slept!). Our wonderful friend Jose was there and we also had the joy of meeting Greg Miller, the GM, Rick Behr, Delores (I hope I spelled your name correctly!) the Director of Experiences, and Gregory Casale, the head chef. They were all entertaining and charming and we had lovely drinks and hors d'oeuvres which made for a great send-off on our last night. We were truly sad to leave them, in fact when we left to go back to our casita, Jose made a point of stopping us and letting us know what a pleasure it had been to have us stay with them. It felt so much like saying good-bye to a friend that we hugged him before we left.My husband had seen the resort on Great Hotels on the Travel Channel but could not remember the exact name of the resort. Since we had never been to Phoenix before, that meant we had to search through every other high-end resort property before he recognized the Royal Palms from its pictures. Even after having looked at all those other properties, we just had a feeling about the Royal Palms and we couldn't have been happier to have made the choice we did. There will be no other place for us to stay on any future visits to Phoenix. Why would we? Coming back to the Royal Palms would be like coming home.And as a testament to the commitment to service and care the Royal Palms offers, look at the negative reviews of any of the other comparable resorts. Do you see any responses from those properties' management? No. And in the scant negative comments I've seen about the Royal Palms (both of which seemed to come from completely unreasonable people in my opinion), they took the time to respond and see if they could make things right. That says it all to me.This is the finest property in Phoenix, hands down. I don't need to stay anywhere else to know that.

Wires *everywhere*.The Ick Factor: Found a old hand-towel stuffed in the windowsill to collect moisture. hair on the shower walls... and on the floor. The Bathroom: Toilet did not flush. DID. NOT. FLUSH. The Noise: Construction in the lot next door started at 6am, housekeeping started at 8am. The shared bathroom for the floor was on the other side of our headboard; it also served as phone booth for guests looking to multi-task at 2am.But, most importantly...The Staff: At check-out I rationally and civilly complained to the woman at the front desk. She didn't handle the complaint but promised to let the manager 鈥?who wasn't in that day 鈥?know when he returned and he would contact us to resolve the issue.(Later, after seeing a photo of the owner/operators on their site, we realised the manager hadn't been away, but in the next room the entire time.)After returning to Ireland we called the hotel to repeat the complaint and got the same woman who checked us out. After being told it was our own fault we didn't complain sooner and more vociferously, I let her know about EU laws allowing charge-backs on credit cards for failure to deliver service as advertised... and only then was I given 20% back from the cost of the stay.","Oct 27, 2008","0","0",2,2,5,2,2,2,1,"3","$95"
"hotel_119","hotel_9853","A Charming Hotel - don't believe the nasty reviews I had already booked my stay at the Edward II when the previous flop house review came out, and I apologized in advance to the coworker whom I'd also booked there. It turns out there was NOTHING to worry about. My coworker had grown up in England and said the inn felt like home to her. Here is my take on the experience. First the cons:The rooms are small, for me this was cozy and nice since I was staying alone. It would've been tougher to share the room with anyone but a spouse/close family member. It is also on a noisy street (even the sides that don't face Lombard are noisy), but I borrowed a fan from the management and had no problems with that. There are a few small items in need of repair (a loose tile in the bathroom, etc.). There is some fuss made about the smell in other reviews. Honestly, to me it didn't smell bad - it just smells like an older building, like my grandmother's house which had radiators just like the Edward II. Really, not a problem except for those who would wear Lysol as cologne.The pros: It is charming. The breakfast room has plenty to eat - oatmeal, fresh fruit, juice, breads, several cereals, pasty, quiche, GOOD coffee and a very extensive selection of loose teas with little teapots for steeping. It was clean and the beds and pillows were comfortable. The innkeepers were very helpful - answered every question and accommodated every request. The neighborhood has plenty going on and is safe for walking. I went out for a late walk and strolled to a 24 Hour Fitness that was about a mile and a half away at around 9 at night and came back an hour and a half later with no concerns about safety. There are a lot of great restaurants, shops and nightlife on Chestnut street a block away. Bottom line, this place was perfectly nice.

"hotel_119","hotel_8330","Confortable room, disappointing breakfast We stayed in the Lion's Head Suite and found the staff friendly and helpful. The sitting room is located just across the sidewalk from busy Lombard street, so the traffic noise was loud. The bedroom was quiet enough if we closed the door. The room had many nice features including a refrigerator, microwave, electric fireplace, soft robes, and a TV with a DVD player. Blockbuster is just across the street.Don't plan on sharing the Jacuzzi. It's not large enough for two people. It does not have a shower curtain, so water splashes on the floor during showers. It's not a huge effort to dry the floor with a towel, but I'd prefer a shower curtain. The breakfast quiche had too many onions for my taste. Other items included fruit juice, cold cereal, toast, instant oatmeal, grocery store pastries, plus apples, bananas and grapes. The breakfast reminds me of the expanded continental breakfast served at many motel chains. We liked the proximity to the Marina and Presidio, and plan to return. We also enjoyed the seafood at Cafe Maritime next door. Hime, the Japanese restaurant on the next block was good, too.","Feb 18, 2008","0","0",4,5,5,5,6,6,1,"3","$95"

"hotel_119","hotel_5711","Cute place, but... Well to start, let me say we booked two room through Expedia, and it happened to be Chinese New Year weekend. This was our description of the room (same for each):Room : Standard queen room with private bathNonsmoking/Smoking: Non-SmokingRoom type: 1 QUEEN BED$127/nightMy sister checked in first, and received an extremely small room that made her feel claustrophobic for the first time in a hotel. The bathroom was not large enough to have two people in there at once. There was no heater in the rom. When she went downstairs to try to upgrade, they said they didn't have any other rooms, and she asked if they had any roms with refrigerators, and they said they didn't . Then a few hours later, I checked in and received a beautiful room with a refrigerator and a rotating heater on top of the frig. We had a little sink in the room next to our bed. The bathroom was a good size with a square tub/shower (but the sink was in the bedroom next to the bed). Overall the size was quaint, but we were very happy with it. When my sister came down to see our room she couldn't believe the difference, when we paid the SAME PRICE! She was not too pleased. I would have been really upset if I were her too! We had Rm. 218 if you'd like to know. We were very happy with it. I was especialy happy because I needed the frig. You could even specify you NEED a frig to get a better room? My sister's room was Rm. 306--AVOID this room.The breakfast was good. They put out a hot quiche pie, cereals, toasts, danishes, coffe, hot chocolate, juice, milk, etc... If you stay here you have to try a cupcake at Kara's Cupcakes right on Scott St. a half a block away.. They are the most incredible cupcakes you will ever try! My favorites were Sweet Vanilla, the chocolate one, and Banana caramel.Good location. Have fun if you go, and have a cupcake for me!","Feb 10, 2008","0","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$95"
"hotel_119","hotel_2906","Stayed in the Mandarin Suite We just returned from one night at the Edward II Inn. Our choices on where to stay in San Francisco on a holiday weekend for just one night were limited. Most places required a three night stay. I was highly concerned after reading the reviews of late, but took a chance, since we were staying in the bed and breakfast rooms with private baths.We really had no problems at all. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The room was clean. And the location was good. The Room: The Mandarin SuiteThe room was up an odd short staircase directly off the breakfast room. But the door was heavy and the sounds from the adjoining room were not an issue. Door was a bit hard to open, but locked securely. The decor was Asian theme oriented with a nice black lacquer Chinese style headboard on the bed and a pretty painted screen. The rest of the furniture was quite dated, and frankly needed updating. The electric fireplace was completely worthless as it produced no heat and was faced in such a way that you couldn't see the fake flames from the bed or the couch! The TV was a whopping12 screen, but it had clear reception and a DVD player. The bathroom was clean and spacious. There were plenty of towels, none of which were super plush, but all smelled, looked and felt clean. There was a blow dryer. There was no shower enclosure, which was a bit odd, but as I said there were lots of towels, so we could clean up the over spray. The other odd thing about the bathroom was the door to the toilet/shower/sink---if you are looking for privacy, forget it! The bathroom door has a large glass window in it. There was a cold mini fridge (I have paid twice as much for rooms in hotels that had warm fridges!). A small wet bar type sink and closet complete the room. The ceilings are high and the lighting was period in appearance. This is in an old building--so it is NOT ADA compliant. Overall the room was fine--it was clean and the theme provided charm to an otherwise outdated interior.The room did have windows that were frosted, so you couldn't see out. There was minimal alley type noise and you could hear dishes clanking from the restaurant next door. All was quiet at about 10 pm. The next noise we heard was around 7:30AM when the garbage truck came. Hey, it's a crowded city and you are staying in an old building--I am not expecting it to be absolutely quiet. There are many wonderful places to eat, wine bars, coffee spots, and shops on Chestnut--one street over from Lombard.The Breakfast:This was also quite nice for the price we were paying. There was hot, fresh homemade quiche, yogurt, two types of cereal, store bought Danish pastry, several types of breads, and a fruit plate. There was milk, water, tea, coffee, hot cocoa and orange juice. The dishes were clean and Jai kept bringing out more piping hot quiche. Newspapers and access to the internet were waiting for us in the morning. They told us when we were leaving that they don't open their pub much to the public, but if you want a drink in the evening, the staff will be happy to serve you. I wish they would have told us that the night we checked in!I have no idea what the European shared bathroom rooms were like--but I think everyone was satisfied with the bed and breakfast rooms. Staff guided us to good food and public transportation options. I think that the accommodations are fine, but certainly not luxurious. I would stay here again.NOTE: Take bus 30 from Powell BART Station--do not attempt to walk from the end of the trolley car line, down Lombard to the Inn. That is the mistake we made coming in and boy, that climb up the big hill with our suitcases was grueling. Bus 30 was a lifesaver! Getting from the Oakland Airport to the Marina area was not a problem--take Air Bart Bus to the BART station in Oakland and then head into San Francisco. Save your money and put it towards a good meal.","Nov 17, 2007","2","2",4,4,4,4,5,5,4,"3","$95"

I never have stayed in something like this so since I booked a room with 2 beds I thought it was one bath to be shared for 2 persons....LOL The room is tiny, barely fits 1 queen and 1 junior bed. That is ok for me I know land is expensive. Breakfast was good, better than in la quinta because of the hot quiche and cake. Also bananas, milk, coffee, tea, yogurt, cereal that is it.Area does not look scary, and I felt safe. Front desk staff is nice. Restaurants around, pharmacies....Bad side: Internet is charged extra. Noisy room faced the street, so I woke up 4 or 5 times during hte night. My friend said it was ok for her. I totally disliked the GREEN MOLD around the sink furniture, yes the sink was in front of my face beside the closet. Room smelled bad I coudl even say to peeing... absolutely disgusting for me. The surprised of what is a shared bathroom (you share bathtub located in one room and a toilette located in another room) is just not for me. One morning while going ot the bathroom I saw a man coming out of the bath room and he did not have towels or the staff you take when you shower then I noted the toilette room was occupied.....I think he pee in the bath tub......I booked this hotel becasue I could not find another and I was going to an interview in a university. Although that I am a student trying to wave some details in order to get student prices .......I would not be back here.....just if I can not find another hotel available....in hte whole SFO","Apr 26, 2007","1","1",3,2,4,2,5,4,2,"3","$95"
"hotel_119","hotel_10189","Miserable Experience I would not recommend Edward II to anyone except people who put location ahead of everything else. The tiny room was extremely cold, day and night. When I asked how to turn on the heat, I was told that the building's heat wasn't turned on and there was no way to heat individual rooms. The closet contained only two hangers, and the advertised gourmet breakfast featured an open bowl of some kind of dark brown dry cereal and open plates of bread and pastries, along with an uncovered, gray-looking quiche. The stale coffee was left to boil on hotplates. We chose individual packages of yogurt and fruit, which were good, but not gourmet as promised. The hotel lacks an elevator for taking luggage to the room. Our family will never return to the Edward Ii and will not recommend it to our friends.","Apr 16, 2007","1","1",2,3,5,3,4,1,5,"3","$95"

My husband and I wanted a nice place to spend a weekend, the inn's website made it sound perfect - pub, coffee throughout the day, english furnishings, evening glass of sherry, coffee throughout the day, etc.. Well what a disappointment- $300 for two nights in a tiny room (advertised as an upgraded queen room) it was a tiny room sparsely furnished with a hard thin mattress and a torn shower curtain. The wireless internet was broken, the pub closed (permanently I guess) the only food is a continental breakfast which is nothing special. If there is a propietor, he/she never showed their face.

Needless to say, I was SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. The outside is attractive and the neighborhood is okay (it is quite close to the Fisherman's Wharf area). First they made us pay up front for the 3 nights (we were planning on staying 3 nights here and 3 nights at the Radisson Miyako for the same price). We climbed up 3 flights of stairs to our TINY room and had a spectacular view of a brick wall and an alley full of trash. The room seriously reminded me of an old maid's room with tapestries of teddy bears and wicker furniture. You can hear everyone come in and even though we were in the back I could still hear all the traffic. It was spotless though no complaints in that department. The staff is pleasant but we decided to stay one night only since we were tired. We did get a refund on 2 nights but they did not refund the 2 nights of parking we had paid in advance. Oh yeah, the parking lot is far and pretty scary. The continental breakfast was above your usual fare. Okay I guess, but don't stay here for your honeymoon.

The rooms and premises were very clean and the staff were knowledgeable and friendly. The rooms were quite small but adequate. My only complaint would be regarding the breakfast room. The inn was filled near capacity and the breakfast room, which is tiny, was always packed. As a result we had to either eat in the pub or bring a tray back to our room. Also, the breakfast itself was only continental, as opposed to a fully-prepared meal, which I gather is the concept of a B'n B. The price of the rooms was reasonable and the location is in close proximity to several San Francisco attractions.

Our room was immaculate and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. We ate breakfast in the condo every morning and had lunch at the Resort twice. The food was excellent in the restaurant. We drove to the Grand Canyon and Sedona for a couple of days. Amazing scenery!! We did lots of shopping and really enjoyed shopping at the Anthem Mills Outlet about a 30 minute drive North of the Legacy. We did the walk at 9:00 a.m. two of the mornings we were there with Jeannie! It was a little over an hr. and we were able to chat and get some exercise in while seeing more of the area. We used the pool area. They provided lots of towels and lounges and umbrellas for shade.They don't allow you to bring food into the pool area and we felt sorry for the families with young children because they were told they couldn't give their children their snacks. They could only eat the food sold in the pool area. There are lots of good restaurants within driving distance from the Legacy and also Scottsdale was fun to visit and not a far drive. I think we will definitely return to the Legacy but would make sure we didn't get room 10113 again. It was backing on to the cleaning supply room and we were disturbed numerous times in our sleep by staff going in and out of this room.

Upon arrival, there was no baggage assistance, our luggage was stored in an unlocked conference room since they stuck VERY closely to their 4PM check-in time. The desk staff was not that competent in handling our check-in and room assignment. There is only one restaurant with limited operating hours, and when our large party (10) arrived one evening for dinner about an hour before closing, we were absolutely assured (without us asking!) by the bartender that there was no way he would serve after the 9pm closing time! 9pm, on a Friday night, for a party of 10 (and others already dining)! Not to mention it took a long time to receive our cocktails and 4 of the 8 ordered were incorrect...The pool bar (serving food as well) closed several hours before the sun went down and the crowd diminished. No pool toys or rafts are allowed in the pool, and the Pool Nazi made sure you did not bring ANY beverages to the pool area, and hounded you with a copy of the written rules until you left or he took your beverages. The pools was very well maintained, plenty of lounge chairs and towels.The rooms (1-bedroom and 2-bedroom suites) were very well appointed, very clean and well-maintained. They had very good appliances, including a large refrigerator/freezer. The golf course was in very good condition, a good challenge, with free club rental and a very low rate for guests.As long as you are aware of the above, I would recommend Legacy for someone desiring a low-key, quiet get-away to the desert of Arizona.

I found the Legacy Golf Resort on the internet and it seemed to have everything I required. (Sun, golf, pool, easy access to and from the airport, reasonably priced). I guess everything in Arizona would be less expensive in summer due to the heat factor, but even if the cost of the weeks stay was 2 or 3 times more it would be worth it. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. The room exceded my expectations. Very clean and well equiped with whatever one needs. The pool area was no exception, it too was cleaned daily and the area was well equiped and comfortable. The golf course was inexpensive and was a very nice course to play. The course staff were excellent representatives of a first a rate resort. Courteous and helpful in all aspects. I did not use the restaurant, therefore I am unable to comment in that regard, however, in keeping with everything else there, it was probably very good. They also have a very nicely equiped, maintained and air conditioned workout facility for an afternoon workout when the sun heats up to 110. This is a family oriented resort which is something new to me as I generally look for a more adult oriented vacation, however I wouldn't hesitate recommending this resort to anyone.

Instead they were professionals.Amenities are nice.Things that this resort desperately needs.MORE SHADE around the pool. They have umbrellas attached to tables....but not enough trees, or umbrellas to shade the lounge chairs. In the day of skin cancer awareness this is a problem.Wireless for the rooms.Swings for kids playground. (more shade)The only real mishap we had was not being able to check into our room for 2 hours past check in time. Housecleaning had not gotten to it yet....and repairs were being done.We went to Botanical Gardens, Zoo, and Arizona Mills Mall, and Lake Pleasant. I recommend all these for your trip there.Lake Pleasant is at least 30 mins away. But the rest are about 5-7 miles away.To Eat: PLEASE go to the FARM which is located practically next door. They have 3 types of restaurants.....one for breakfast, one for lunch (picnic style) and fance dinner restaurant. You will feel like you are on a retreat. They have plenty of WIDE open space with grass, and in the distance they have the chickens, and veggies growing. The food is made and grown there....so fresh is for sure.Also...please check out the Secret Garden Restaurant VINTAGE MARKET...similar retreat type feel. Koi pond, and old 1929 spanish colonial home....with huge grassy park like area connected to restaurant. (meant for weddings).Ok....married 7 years....but if I were to get married again these are the 2 places that would be excellent choices for receptions.","May 6, 2008","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$280"

It had a full kitchen and separate living/dining area. It was perfect for myself and my two bridesmaids, moms, hairdresser, and makeup artist to all get ready for the big day. It was very comfortable and almost felt like we were getting ready at home. It was also nice to relax in the big two person jacuzzi tub each evening.

The golf course itself was in excellent shape and set up to be both playable and challenging for players of all levels.I did not get a chance to take advantage of all the ammenities that the resort offers, as my time was pretty well committed to the golf class, but there appeared to be a nice pool, shuffleboard, and the concierge service was running regular events and excursions.Overall, a really nice stay.","Feb 15, 2008","0","0",1,5,4,5,4,4,1,"4","$280"

Not a large number of restaurants around but Gallaghers is good for those wanting to view sports on many TV screens and the restaurant at the Legacy has never disappointed.

Beautiful view from our room of the South Mountain. The pool was clean, people who worked there were friendly and professional. However, there were some issues with noise with thin walls between units. Also, the room we were in had a patio door facing the main driveway, (we were on the 2nd floor) and the noise from cars and golf carts driving back and forth was a little disturbing, especially around the end of the day. Also, the room needed to be refurbished and carpet cleaned. I must also reiterate though that the staff was very happy to help and very accomodating. When we arrived for an early check-in, we were mistakenly given a room that had just been checked out of a few hours prior, so everything was a mess!

"hotel_120","hotel_6091","Great Place To Stay !! We booked the Legacy through Preferred Access and really enjoyed our one week stay.

Lots of parking, the on site restaurant is small but the food is great. Staff if friendly too. Washer  dryer in each room (even the studios) and the full kitchen is nice and has everything you need. Go buy some groceries and move right in. There is a Fry's market about 1 1/2 miles away.Only downsize to this resort is no free Internet in the rooms.

"hotel_120","hotel_2144","Well-Kept Secret - Super Stay! I booked through Priceline and got the studio for $40 a night. I upgraded to a one bedroom suite. These are time-share condos - the studio is the one bedroom lockout unit - and - the one bedroom is the larger unit with full kitchen. These units are clustered into two story, eight plex units with no elevator. I had a nice view of the golf course from the living room, dining room, and bedroom. I agree with all the positive statements made in prior reviews. The only negatives are: (1) There are only six parking spaces for every eight rooms. On Saturday nights, it is not unusual for some one to host a party and the guests use up most of the parking spaces. I counted 24 cars at 2 am with no parking permit last Saturday night. Security made no attempt to police the parking problem. So, if you plan to enjoy some of the nightlife, be prepared for a long walk from the golf course parking lot back to your condo; and (2) Housekeeping did not clean my room for the last two days of my stay. I did complain, but their solution was for me to leave my room from 6 pm - 7 pm so they had time to clean. Since they had from noon until 5 pm to clean, I did not go along with that solution. They gave me new towels only after a long discussion, but did not empty the trash. Although there is no wi-fi or free internet, there is free access to a computer with a printer in the lobby. It was great to print out my boarding passes, while waiting to check out. Also, if you have dial-up, the phone call is only fifty cents for an unlimited call. Typical of a time share, there was a king-size bed in the bedroom and a queen-size sofa bed in the living room.

"hotel_120","hotel_1428","Laud the Legacy I have been visiting the Legacy Golf Resort on 32nd St. in Phoenix regularly for the past 3 years and plan to continue to do so in the future. In comparison to other resorts in the Valley of the Sun I find that their golf course, accommodations, ammenities, and staff represent the Valley's best golf resort value by far. The golf course is kept in superb shape even in the heat of summer. The course is challenging, but a fair test for golfers of any ability. The practice facilities are extensive. The golf shop has a great selection of golf apparel, and you get a 25% discount just for filling out a questionaire. Swimming pool, restaurant, tennis, sand volleyball, hot tub, are also on property. Each morning guests have announcements on voice mail of planned activities available for that day. A one bedroom condo, will provide you with everything you need for a short or extended stay. Washer, drier, complete kitchens, stereo, 2 TV's, double vanity sink, jetted tub, separate room with standing shower and another single vanity sink, dishwasher, balcony, and dining area. Even the studios have dishwashers, washers, driers, fridge, sink, microwave, and 2 burner range. The area around the Legacy has restaurants at Arizona Mills Mall, movie theaters, and other attractions close by. Finally, I have found the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff to be all that a guest could ask for. Carol who has taken my reservations, to the girls at the registration check in desk, to Louie and Joe who are starters on the course, to Moto, one of the cart guys, to Nick Zell who has given me a lesson or two, to Chris, the head pro, to Chris Morrow in time share sales -- There are others, I just don't know all their names. The impression I get is that their friendliness is sincere. They come across as real people, being nice because that is the way they are, rather than the robotic types that serve you because they are paid to do so at other resorts I have visited.I look forward to my future visits.

We went to dinner at a local restaurant and arrived at the pool near 6 PM. The guys in the group went to get drinks and were directed by the bartender to go to the clubhouse, as the pool bar was closing. The clubhouse told them that their liquor license did not allow them to serve us drinks to take to the pool. I questioned the bartender, who was very rude, and asked for a manager. The Manager, Ryan, confirmed that the concession to the restaurant and the pool bar had been sold to different parties effective Jan 2006. As a result, liquor laws did not allow them to serve liquor in the other location. We actually observed the pool staff confiscate someone else's drink. Later, we left the pool and went to the clubhouse for drinks and appetizers. Karen, an excellent waitress, indicated that while they could give us drinks in plastic cups to take to our room, we shouldn't take them to the pool because they would be taken from us. I can't imagine that a resort would expected vacationers not to enjoy a drink by the pool at sunset.

Rooms are not very big, walls are very thin. The pool is a bit smaller than the pictures depict and is usually a bit of a walk from most rooms (music is a bit loud also). The weird part is were it's built. This is no Scottsdale!. The surrounding neighborhood is a bit rough to say the least. With that in mind you would expect there would be a security gate at the entrance, but low-and-behold there isn't. There are a few resteraunts on Baseline road, but for the most part your going to have to take a bit of a drive to find a decent place to eat. The golf course was the real savior here.

When we called the front desk to ask our question she said she didn't know the answer and would transfer us to the conceirge. When he answered the phone all he said was ask someone else and hung up.

It was close to the airport and ASU(we attended graduation), yet it was quiet and away from the busy streets.

It has a GREAT outdoor pool for lap swimming and I found a paved running trail onlly a mile from the resort, so that I could do some 10 mile runs away from traffic. The 1 bedroom unit was spacious and quiet and we appreciated the DVD players and stereo unit. We did not golf while we were there or use the restaurants, so I can't comment on those.Some of the previous comments were negative regarding the (lack of) friendliness of the staff, and we really didn't have much contact with them as we were busy doing our own things.

"hotel_120","hotel_5615","Legacy compared to Marriott Canyon Villas My wife and I stayed at the Marriott Canyon Villas (CV) in Scottsdale on a 3-day timeshare promotion. The Marriott was okay, but the CV we stayed in was quite cramped. The hall leading to our room was stark concrete, poorly lighted from the parking lot. You felt like you were in a crowded apartment building. It did not feel comfortable to walk, felt like a parking lot everywhere. You can use the JW Marriott across the road but you have to drive over or take a shuttle. We drove, then had a fairly healthy hike from the parking lot to the huge facility. Everything is huge, crowded, corporate. In contrast, we finished up our stay at the Legacy Golf Resort. The Legacy is a pleasant place, very well maintained. The rooms are larger and nicer than the Marriott. It feels human, pleasant to walk around, nice scale. While we liked the Wildfire Faldo course at the Marriott, the golf course at Legacy is very nice too, and probably a bit more challenging though comparable and much cheaper. The little restaurant in the club had a great veranda and very good food and service. The workout facilities were fine. A few blocks away is the Farm at South Mountain, 3 charming restaurants in one location for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We had a great breakfast there.

Upon check-in, the staff appeared to have little time to check in the guests that had arrived. After waiting in line for approximately half an hour, we were told that our room was not ready and there was no clear indication given when it would be ready. Upon further inquiry, including a request to speak to the management, we were finally given a room number and told that we could check in when house-keeping was finished cleaning the room. The reason given for the delay was that the previous guests had checked out late and the Resort had no control over this. However, as we approached our suite, we noticed that several of the other suites were still in the process of being cleaned, leading us to believe that the Resort was under-staffed.  One of the points made by management while we were booking the suite was the fact that we would love the room and it was worth the wait because we would have a wonderful view of the mountains / golf course from our upper balcony. When we were finally able to occupy the room, we stepped onto the balcony and had a wonderful view....of two Large Eucalyptus trees...which totally blocked any other view.  We have booked suites at this resort several times in the past and are very reluctant to do so in the future because of the poor customer service.","Mar 23, 2007","1","0",2,4,2,4,2,2,4,"4","$280"

The restaurant/bar was supposed to close at 10pm, but on 2 different nights, it closed early. Our sheets were too short and when we called about housekeeping, they offered to deliver sheets, but it stopped there. We had housekeeping once for the entire week. The shower head was like standing under a high pressure washer without any actual 鈥渟hower鈥? We were given bad information during check-in about the internet and then when questioned to resolve the issue, was told sorry, we can't do anything about it.

"hotel_120","hotel_2451","Only Fair In reading this review, you need to know that we don't golf and aren't too interested in a pool. We booked this room because it was the right price for what we thought would be a quiet and relaxing room for a week of shopping in Phoenix.1. Unless you go to a time-share presentation, you will never know the amenities of the place. There is nothing in the room--not even the restaurant's menu--but you will get a voice mail message EVERY morning telling you to come to the concierge desk for your welcome packet. The packet has only the family activities for the week and the concierge gives you a hard-sell pitch to go to the time-share presentation. We had a pretty full schedule and aren't new to Phoenix, so didn't want to waste time on the presentation. 2. The walls are thin. We heard everyone around us and their TVs--like a less-than-average motel. We heard no outside noise--no birds woke us up in the morning--but we did hear the rhythmic creaking of the bedsprings in the room above us.3. It is a pretty propery. Golf course views are relaxing. Having a kitchenette is helpful. The beds are comfortable. And the price is definitely right (we paid $109 for the studio). The concierges seemed to really know Phoenix well, from what we heard them telling other people. If you don't mind hearing your neighbors, or go in the off-season, it's a decent place--just nothing special.","Dec 17, 2006","1","1",4,4,5,4,5,4,1,"4","$280"
"hotel_120","hotel_8159","Great resort for golfing My husband  I along with my brother just got back from 5 nights at the Legacy Golf Resort where we are timeshare owners. The resort is very spread out and has really nice rooms. We were booked into a one bedroom in the 9 block, called Casitas. So we had about a 4 minute walk to the main building/golf pro shop. We didn't mind the walk, unless we were booked for golfing, we drove ourselves up to the Bag drop area. For those who do not want to walk far, book yourself in Casitas 1 or 2. #6 is the furthest away.The room was spacious and all of the amenities we expected, although we couldn't find a remote for the 2nd television, but we didn't call to complain, oh and the pepper shaker was empty, otherwise beautiful room. My brother slept on the pullout out couch and said it wasn't very comfortable, so we thought about going to Target to get a bed pad for $50, but never got around to it. Our king bed was ok, definitely not a HIlton or Westin type.One complaint is the location. Not close to any night life for us 30 year olds. We had to drive about 20 minutes to Old Tempe for the nightlife, and wanted the serious nightclubs, but they were 30-35 minutes away , so we never actually made it up there as one of us always had to stay sober. Phoenix and Old Tempe is awesome - it's always Happy Hour! 4-7 and then again 9-close at a lot of pubs including Uno and Great Expectations. The Conceirge desk was very helpful. If you want to go to the Casino, the conceirge desk has tickets for a free limo ride to take you there and back, as long as you agree to stay for 3 hours. Golfing was great with our ownership rate of 25%. And 25% off at the spa too! If you're not an owner, I'm sure there would be incentives to go for a tour.We drove up to the other property owned by Legacy, which is called Orange Tree and it's got a really pretty golf course, and it's more expensive. The rooms are right on the golf course, so not as private as Legacy. Legacy is a good location for privacy and it's on the edge of an Industrial area. The pool is horseshoe shaped and has 2 hottubs that were lovely after a day of golfing!We also went to the Phoenix Coyote game - bought tickets at the box office for the cheap seats $15, and after the 1st period moved down to better seats. Good cheap entertainment!Also drove Tuscon and on the way took a detour to the Biosphere 2, which was cool if you're into science and saw the facility where 6 people lived under a glass dome for 2 years.Also drove to the Grand Canyon - it took 3.5 hours - we went on the American Thanksgiving, so the roads were dead. Mapquest says it supposed to take 4.5 hours, so you be the judge. The drive was worth it!! Gorgeous scenery and don't forget to drive to Sedona! That's only 2 hours from Phoenix and totally awesome for scenery and hiking.Like cheap shopping? 4 minutes away is the Arizonz Mill shopping centre. www.arizonamills.comWell that's all - I'm sure we'll come back in a few years and book a two bedroom!

"hotel_120","hotel_6464","Loved it! We (two Couples) used our RCI points to stay in a 2 bedroom for a week and golf. It was wonderful. Clean, spacious and up to date furnishings. There was only one complaint... the sheets. They did not use a fitted sheet on the bottom and it kept coming off. The grounds were beautiful. I will stay there again because it was easy access to airport and a lot of nice golf courses.We golfed at the Legacy twice. Nice course and well kept. We also golfed at Raven South Mountain...it was okay, liked the Legacy better. Estrella Mountain...really liked the course...especially the back nine.

The grounds are beautiful and the rooms clean and up to date. Most of the staff are young college age people who were friendly and helpful. We were able to talk them and learn alot about the area. We had never been to Arizona before and they gave us lots of information. The whole resort is beautiful but the area around it is dreary.

"hotel_120","hotel_2785","I'm just glad it was free My husband and I stayed here for one night as an incentive for sitting through some boring sales pitch for 2 hours about time sharing. However, I'm just glad it was free. The refridgerator ran all night long. It was so annoying. I turned it off at one point, it was so bad. The hotel's restaurant was so-so. We ordered hamburgers and fries that tasted like something you could cook at home. Our waiter was pompous and lazy. When I told him I wanted to order a hamburger, he looked at me like I had three heads. I guess he's never heard of a hamburger before. And we had to ask the bar wench to refill our waters since he was too busy lollygagging in the kitchen with the other employees.Overall, I'm just glad it didn't cost me a cent.

"hotel_120","hotel_4464","Legacy--great price, great vacation for couples I went to the Legacy with my boyfriend in June. Our 1-bedroom casita (huge) was immaculate for our entire 5-night stay. If we left dishes in the drainer, the staff would even pop them in the dishwasher for us in our absence. Our first afternoon there, a problem with the pool closed it down but it was promptly reopened the next morning. Although the parking lot was almost always jam-packed with guests, our place (near the entrance and overlooking the golf course) was quiet and peaceful throughout our stay. The resort staff was warm and earnestly helpful. An older woman at the help desk was obligated to soft sell a timeshare, but when we said we weren鈥檛 interested, the pitch immediately ended and wasn鈥檛 brought up again. We did our sightseeing both in conjunction with the resort (the Grand Canyon trip was organized with a day-long van tour) and on our own. We have friends there who took us river tubing; we also made our way to a Diamondbacks game--my first indoor stadium; and we toured the Botanical Gardens slooowly in 100+ temps. But I was equally happy crashing in our place watching DVDs under the ceiling fan. The patio was a lovely touch as well. I would go back to the Legacy in a heartbeat. A great, affordable vacation (plus we saved major bucks with a 40-min layover flight).[------------]","Aug 16, 2006","5","5",1,6,5,6,4,4,5,"4","$280"

"hotel_120","hotel_4778","Great resort, has everything you need Just got back from four nights at the Legacy Golf Resort. I chose the resort based on positive reviews on this website and was not disappointed. This is not a particularly fancy resort, but it has everything you need for a very comfortable stay, especially for families because of the apartment-like facilities in the unit. On the other hand, I was there by myself and did not feel besieged by kids running around because the resort is spread out enough. The resort is part of the Shell timeshare system but there is no pressure to join. The resort consists of about a dozen clusters of two-story townhouses. Each unit has a balcony or patio you can sit on. I asked for a unit with a view and got one on the second floor facing the 18th fairway, which was nice. I had a studio, which was spacious with a king size bed, sitting area with sofa and two armchairs, and a full kitchen (sink, half size fridge, coffee maker, toaster, stove with two burners, washing machine, dishes, glasses, pots and pans, utensils, don't remember if there's a microwave). The unit also has a stacked washer/dryer which was very handy. They provide soap for the dishwasher and also to handwash dishes, but for some reason no soap for the washer/dryer but no biggie. The room was clean and seemed relatively new; no dirt, peeling wallpaper, or other visible signs of wear. There is housekeeping service every day, as in a regular hotel. Parking is outside each unit. The grounds are very well kept.Check-in was smooth. The staff at the registration desk is young and somewhat less polished than the five star resorts, but they were friendly and efficient. I had a problem with the high speed internet connection in my room ($9.95 for 24 hours) and they moved me to another room right away at my request, instead of sending someone to fiddle with the wires.The main building also houses the golf pro shop, restaurant and spa/gym. I tried each of these. The pro shop is well stocked and well run. The golf course was in good shape and well maintained; it scores 4.5 stars in Golf Digest, which is as high as any golf course in the Phoenix area. It's not a fancy course but I enjoyed my round, especially at the twilight rate of $25 (for guests, and $29 for nonguests) which starts at noon. Yes, it's hot, but you have to expect that if you go to Phoenix in June.I had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. It's good, basic food, like you would expect in a clubhouse. A little pricey for what you get, but not outrageous, and the service was very good. No complaints there. I didn't use the spa services but did use the gym, which was reasonably well equipped with two treadmills, bicycles, weights and so on. The swimming pool is next to the main building and is popular with families, though I did not use it.The resort is about ten minutes south of the airport. As others have noted, you pass through a couple of spotty neighborhoods on the way there and you may want to think twice about stopping at the nearby gas stations late at night because of the people who hang out there. But the resort itself is fine and there are security guards driving around the parking lots all the time. I felt very safe. There are a couple of shopping malls only five minutes away by car (in another direction) and the resort is centrally located for access to other golf courses, restaurants and so on. I think the positives of the resort's location outweighs the negatives.All-in-all, the Legacy is a great place to stay without the expensive frills. The summer rates are amazing and you can book directly through their website. I highly recommend this place.","Jun 24, 2006","6","6",6,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$280"
"hotel_120","hotel_3341","Nice place good value Had a business trip to Phoenix and decided on the Legacy as I thought I could get a round of golf in before and after business. Figured the place and golf course would be empty as the snow birds normally leave in April. No such luck. The place and golf course full to the brim. Had to go next door to the Raven Golf course.Stayed in a studio and it was pretty well furnished. Nice deck with a partial view of one of the fairways. Had breakfast at the club house and it was good and reasonable. Also a very nice pool area. I must say all of the employees were nice and went out of their way to say hello.Probably would not stay there again, on business anyway.

"hotel_120","hotel_7051","Nice resort/Good value Stayed at the Legacy the first 2 nights in May 2006 and came away w/ a generally good feeling about the place. First problem was the directions they have on their web site as I was coming from the airport, where the rental car location has NO relevance to the directions. Life became better as I checked in w/ a smooth check-in, nice concierge who went out of her way to solicit me on any needs I mayhave for dinner. Recommended Rustler Roost, a nice wine bar/organic restaurant next door or a new sports bar, Gallaghers about 1/2 mile away. Room was nice and big w/ sitting area, and marble bathroom. Bonus was refrigerator, microwave, small stove and DW. Nice patio w/ 2 deck chairs where I had a beer on each nite. On-site restaurant is really just a golf bar, however, had a free (corporate card) breakfast there both morning and it was top notch. Even had a chance to play golf one nite @5:15pm tee-off, clubs were complimentary as I was staying on-site and they only charged me for 9 holes and threw in a cart. Very nice course and knowledgeable golf employees. Not yet, a top notch resort but w/ a better on-site restaurant, a bit better on-site experience they could achieve in a couple of years. Value was excellent as w/ corporate rate I stayed at the Legacy at a Hamptons Inn price.","May 2, 2006","14","11",6,5,1,6,1,4,1,"4","$280"
"hotel_120","hotel_6812","Lovely resort with beautiful grounds We stayed in a two bedroom condo at the Legacy for a week with our two teenage sons. The unit was actually a one bedroom apartment with an adjoining studio apartment. Both were very spacious and spotlessly clean. The boys used their studio basically to sleep/wash-up and hang out although it had a kitchenette, terrace and washer/dryer. The one bedroom has a huge living room/dining room/kitchen (fully equipped) with a washer/dryer/dishwasher etc. All detergents etc are supplied so if you go hiking in nearby South Mountain State Park, you can wash your clothing afterwards. The one bedroom bathroom is enourmous - soaking jacuzzi (although no jets for the back), marble shower, toilet (duh) and three sinks. Studio bathroom is pretty standard. One bedroom has two TVs, DVD and VCR plus internet for a fee. All staff was very helpful - whatever we needed, they gave us, promptly and with a smile. Food in the clubhouse was fine - nothing special but most golf courses aren't. Pool area was nicely kept, clean and with a grill house/bar. The fitness room was huge and well equipped - better than most four star hotels actually (I travel a lot for business). I had a massage after a daylong hike and it was done quite well by a CMT. I would strongly recommend that you request a top floor quiet room with a view (either golf course or mountains); we did a few weeks in advance and called to reconfirm. We were very happy with the accommodations.The South Phoenix neighborhood is basic (not scary as some have written but certain not strolling material). If you need to go to the drugstore, Starbuck, supermarket, there are several in the immediately area. The resort grounds are spacious enough if you feel the need for a peaceful after dinner walk. Literally just up the road (32nd St.), a 5 minute walk, is The Farm at South Mountain, an internationally reknown Slow Food organic restaurant. Coincidentally, it was featured in USA Today as one of 10 top picks in the country while we were there. It is open for breakfast, lunch, happy hour and dinner. Best place to eat downtown is Wild Thaiger on the 2600 block of Central Ave (just past the Heard Museum) - outstanding Thai food - better than in LA or NYC. Overall, I would certainly stay at the Legacy again. It was a great deal and an easy drive to any place I might want to see or do in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.","Apr 16, 2006","14","11",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$280"

"hotel_120","hotel_6065","Wonderful Unit, Close Proximity to Airport My husband and I stayed at the Legacy for two nights in a one-bedroom, upstairs corner unit which overlooked the golf course. After reading the reviews I requested an upstairs unit, quiet location, nice view. I was very pleased and surprised when my requests were met. The furnishings are very nice, the unit was spotlessly clean, and the view from our balcony was lovely. The people at the front desk were pleasant and efficient. I particularly liked the gym which afforded a pleasant view of the golf course. We got take-out food from the restaurant there which was reasonably priced and tasty enough. The swimming pool looked to be nice too, but we're not swimmers, so we never ventured into it. Now, that first night we hardly slept. We kept hearing what sounded like the front door opening and footsteps coming down the hall. I was a bit scared, and even got up to investigate more than once. Big brave me. If I had been staying on my own, I'd have called the front desk to enquire what was going on. By the way, we heard the same noises during the day, in addition to other odd noises. We never did figure out what the noises were, and in the end, surmised that perhaps the place is haunted?! Or, it could be the building settling? However, all in all, we'd stay at the Legacy again.

"hotel_120","hotel_4406","Enjoyed Th eLegacy Golf Resort Three of us stayed at the Legacy Golf Resort last week in a standard room for our week long golf holiday. We were cramped for dough so jammed three of us into the standard room but everything was more than fine. The pool was closed while we were there for renos but that's fine---we were there to golf and the new pool opened the day we departed and looks real nice. The golf course is nice too, nothing too special but a good course nonetheless. The rooms are nice and clean and very comfortable and they had ample cooking facilities too if you are so inclined to prep your meals etc. Daily newspaper was a nice treat too. The neighborhood is fine, the complex is something like 200+ acres and is more or less gated and very safe. Safety was a non-isuse to us despite what one or two folks say about the neighborhood. Our only minor issue was that we had the front desk fax a document for us and we don't believe it was ever faxed and to make it worse the document was shredded by the office staff who maintained that was the 'policy'. To say the least, we found that a little odd but life rolls on. The Legacy is real close to Sky Harbor airport, downtown Phoenix, Tempe and virtually everything.

This was a beautiful resort with great landscaping, fantastic views, and incredibly good food in their restaurant. We stayed at a time when they were reseeding the golf course, so it was a pleasure not to be crowded with golfers. The view of South Mountain in the evening was beautiful and romantic. We had a 2 bedroom condo combination and it was larger than my home, with beautiful red marble bathrooms and top-notch furniture and kitchen appliances. We've stayed in a number of Gold Crown timeshares and this place was the absolute best.

"hotel_120","hotel_2054","Had a great time with Legacy We loved the Legacy! We stayed there for four nights in early October. We had a studio suite room with a golf course view. We were on the second floor. First of all, our room had tons of amenities. We had a kitchenette with a microwave, two burner stove, mini-fridge, toaster, coffee maker, even a washer and dryer. As an earlier reviewer noted, the beds are a little on the firm side, but I did not find that it inhibited my sleep. Additionally, a young family did check into the adjoining suite during our stay, and I did notice noise as a result. However, I do not think it was enough of a problem to keep me from staying at the Legacy again.The views of the golf course from our balcony were great, and the pool was large and uncrowded, with a fun little pool bar. The resort practically abuts South Mountain Park in Phoenix, and the resort activities staff offered lots of free activities for guests. (Watercolor painting, hiking in the park, etc.) They also have a fitness room that is complimentary for guests. We ate in the resort restaurant, and the food was wonderful. (I had a creamy, rich steak diane.) As well, we thought our rooms were extremely well-priced. (We booked them through an online booking service and got a great deal.)

Most two bedroom units at other resorts would only have dishwasher, washer/dryer in the larger unit only. The huge jacuzzi tub was a nice touch.The full kitchen made it convenient to make some meals so we did not have to eat out all the time.The staff at the front desk was very accommodating and helpful.

The cost to use the range, $15, was unbelievable, what value! Free to use chipping and putting - fantastic!If I had to mention a negative, the choice from the restaurant menu is slightly limited although the food and service is excellent. However, part of a good holiday is exploring places to eat, and there is plenty of choice just a short drive away.In conclusion, this was absolutely the best place I have ever stayed.

"hotel_125","hotel_5181","Quiet room, firm bed We pulled up to the Kyoto at 5 pm on New Year's Eve. The valets and doormen efficiently unloaded our truck full of luggage and computers.However, the front desk was understaffed and we waited over 30 minutes to check in. Even while checking in, the person helping us was forced to answer 2 phone calls. There should have been someone in a back room doing that. Once checked in, we and our luggage quickly made it up to our room.It was a tiny, triangle shaped room, but had a nice sized bathroom, desk, a couple of chairs and mini fridge. The air temp was good (I've found I often have to set the AC to high when first entering a room). Only real problem was that the second mirror outside the bath was missing. This made it a bit challenging to get ready to go out.Our bed was very firm. If you need that, perfect. My wife slept well. Lastly, there was very little sound transmitted from above, below or from either side. All in all, very pleasant. Would have been 5 stars if the check-in was more efficient.","Jan 2, 2009","0","0",5,5,4,5,3,6,1,"3.5","$218"

"hotel_125","hotel_10250","Pleasant Downtown LA hotel I've had trouble finding hotels in Downtown LA which are both pleasant and reasonable. The Kyoto Grand, while hardly grand, fit that bill--I got a rate of $107. The hotel is located in (really at the edge of) Little Tokyo, probably the liveliest area of Downtown LA--one that has restaurants and stores open in the evening. At the same time it's only a few blocks from Union Station and from the Downtown core. It's a good location for a car-free traveler, which I was on this trip. It's near the Red Line subway, the Gold Line light rail, and numerous Metro and DASH buses.The hotel's location and its height are its best assets in my view. Asking for a high floor, I was given a 10th floor room, which had an unobstructed view facing south (other directions taller buildings might have blocked it).The room was acceptable, arguably Japanese abstract art on the walls. The bed was comfortable enough and there was good natural light in the daytime and darkness at night. I didn't have any noise problems. There was a decent radio--something you don't always get.As people said the bathroom is small--particularly annoying was a short bathtub with what felt like a sharp edge at the back when I tried to stretch out in it. The bathtub seemed chintzy next to a fairly generous room. Hotels should have adequate length bathtubs or none at all.I didn't try the hotel's restaurants--I went to Weller Court--a 3 story shopping court with multiple restaurants which was literally the next building over. The garden didn't really send me, but I can see where some people would like it.I might stay here again or I might go elsewhere in Downtown LA if I could get a deal, even if those areas are less lively.","Nov 27, 2008","0","0",6,5,6,6,5,1,1,"3.5","$218"
"hotel_125","hotel_6921","nickel and dime The hotel itself was Nice. The room was ok. Upon entering you got the slight smell of mustiness, the carpet had small snags in it, and there were no RCA connections on the TV to hook up a DVD player. There were 2 bottles of water on the table with a $5 price tag on each which would be billed to your room if you drank them which I thought was a joke! The Shower was missing some Caulking around the tub and I think they stopped making that pink shower tile back in the 80鈥檚. The electronic keys I had for the room only worked after trying each of them numerous times. Paying $9.95 for internet service per day was ridiculous when you can get it free at all Starbucks and Best Westerns. And the daily self Parking fee of $24 dollars was a joke, even though it is quoted at $22 in the black guest book in the room. And to top everything off upon checking out I assumed the price I was quoted and booked online included all fees, but I was informed it did not include the daily $13 hotel tax which I had to pay. It seems that this hotel is more worried about getting you in the door at a reasonable room rate so they can nickel and dime you into getting a second job not unlike Home depot. In my opinion if they took as much time paying attention to there guests as they do charging you for any and everything, this hotel would be a nicer place to stay. Not a sermon just a thought.","Nov 27, 2008","0","0",4,3,4,4,5,4,3,"3.5","$218"

They refused to honor our reservations, claiming the hotel was oversold. Instead they sent us to the Wilshire Hotel which would not have been our choice. As a result we do not have a good opinion of the Hotel, and cannot comment on the accommodations because there were none.

We took a shuttle bus to the hotel from LAX and it cost us $US15 each - very reasonable. When we arrived the front desk staff checked us in very quickly and couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Every time we passed the desk on the way in or out we were always greeted with a smile and a hello. Our room was very nice. We were on the 12th floor, overlooking the Federal Building looking towards the mountains, with a kingsize bed and beautiful towels. Our room was spotlessly clean and very quiet. When we first arrived in our room, we found the airconditioner was a little noisy, so we rang the front desk and asked if someone could look at it. Within minutes two very friendly maintenance men came and repaired the problem - fabulous service and problem solved. The location of the Kyoto (Downtown) is within walking distance of places like El Pueblo, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and Union Station. Transport is very close by if you need to go by bus or train. The gardens in the hotel are beautiful. Breakfast is not included in the price.

We were also given ome lovely iced green tea as a refreshment as we checked in. We had just come up on the train and were not looking our best - we were dressed VERY casually and I was carrying a large backpack - so we almost looked like a couple of drifters, but we were greeted like honored guests just the same. Bravo!The room was small - yet comfortable and clean. What more can you ask for? The bathroom was very clean - this is one of our most important points as no one likes a nasty bathroom.We walked through the hotel - the gardens are lovely - and it is quite impressive that they have such a lush garden spot on the top of a portion of the hotel. We ate at the Thousand Cranes restaurant - this is a top notch Japanese restaurant. We sat at the sushi bar and had a superb eating experience.The Little Tokyo neighborhood is very nice. The area is clean and we were told it has been recently cleaned up and is an up and coming area. There are tons of neat little restaurant in the area and it is also an easy walk to the new home of the LA Philharmonic!

"hotel_125","hotel_9297","Okay... I had stayed here several times when it was still the New Otani, but this was my visit under the new name/management. The New Otani had been a solid 3-Star hotel, but I had high expectations for this visit, perhaps because of the new name (Kyoto Grand Hotel). Maybe because of those high expectations, I was quite disappointed. The hotel lobby is not spectacular, but very nice. Our room, however, was at a 2-Star level. There were numerous stains on the carpet, and the bathroom, in particular, was quite rundown. Of course, it's all about price/value. In that regard, I feel that it was a good deal, based on the $127/night price I got through Orbitz.

The worst part was that because of its downtown location, there were many helicopters flying around that made it hard for me to sleep. The tea garden sounds nice, but in reality is rather small and not exactly a long romantic stroll.Not much in the area, and so like much of LA, you'll need a car to get around.

"hotel_125","hotel_7970","Tranquility at the edge of downtown LA After being intrigued by this gem of a hotel back when it was known as the New Otani, I was glad to wind up there recently with a successful Priceline bid.The room was what I expected for a 3-star hotel: perfectly adequate, nothing to go wild over. At registration the desk clerk handed me a cup of iced tea and a warm towel while I was signing in--a nice touch, and a sign of the thoughtful service that was to mark my stay throughout.The lobby's great, and the third-floor garden is a haven. The restaurant A Thousand Cranes is worth checking out. It's pricey, but the Sunday buffet is one of the best meals (and high-end bargains!) I've had in Los Angeles.The location, with a bail bond place practically next door, may be off-putting, but that's because a city detention center is nearby, as is City Hall. Thanks to one or two restaurants open as late as 3 a.m. I've wandered the streets in the area late at night without incident for more than 25 years. If you use public transit, there are many bus lines that go past it. The Civic Center Metro stop is a third of a mile away, and Union Station is just over half a mile away.It's not Beverly Hills, but it's not Blade Runner territory either.","Jul 17, 2008","2","2",5,4,3,5,6,6,1,"3.5","$218"
"hotel_125","hotel_1729","Very Grand and special I live in LA without a car. I looked for a hotel near the Metro station and Art Museum I was attending within walking distance. This place was a gem. Three blocks from the Metro station and two blocks from the Japanese American National Museum, right in the heart of LA's Little Tokyo. Formerly the New Otani Hotel, (It still has an Asian/Japanese theme) they have about a 20 story tower complete with everything you need. A lobby bar which also serves food, the weekend bartender Roberto G. makes the best mojito you could ever have and also is so personable he shold have a tv show.. Also a lobby level restaurant (Azealia) for mainly american food. A couple floors up are the main eateries, a fine food venue with a sushi and shashimi area, a place with a lot of beef and asian inspired influences and a mainly nighttime bar with every drink you want, including every type of sake, as well as food items. Hours vary depending on the day but there's always something, including room service if it's that late. Plus you're in the heart of little Tokyo. Yeah it might not feel great at 10 or 11 at night but it's safe! And there's a ton of other places to eat as well as the in-house Starbuck's, but they close early.For the hotel itself, easy and quick check-in and out, very competent staff, I never had a problem go unanswered. The room, I had a basic room, was everything you could expect, windows that open, variable A/C, bathroom toiletries, the tv even includes a few HBO channels.My favorite feature was the authentic Japanese Garden, located on a terrace on the third floor, it is a several acre oasis garden of foliage, streams and a waterfall. In one corner there is a full bar and grill where you can walk-up or order food to your table. Grilled ribs and a cool drink while admiring the LA skyline in the middle of a Japanese Garden, how cool!The hotel's staff was always there, not only for security but to make sure you had no problems.

There was a large group (25+) of 18-21 year olds staying there on Saturday night who were extremely rude and beligerant; I felt unsafe with them around, but the staff seemed unconcerned about the profanity there were loudly speaking throughout the lobby and garage. I was traveling with my 15 y.o. niece on a road trip from San Jose area, and we ended up leaving a day early even though I had prepaid for the night.

Don't be afraid to walk outside the hotel and around Little Tokyo. It's a nice little area with some good Japanese restaurants. In the room, the view was nice, and the Japanese sliding screens on the windows were a nice touch. Also, it's nice to have the mini-fridge. The bathroom was very clean, but still needs some updating. The tile around the bath tub is a gaudy pink color, and although I liked the handheld shower head, it wouldn't stay in the right position when I put it on the hook. The faucet at the sink was difficult to operate and get a good temperature. I will also insert my usual complaint about extra fees, including $24 for self-parking.

Our room was a nice size, clean, and our favorite part was the Japanese screens on the windows. We had a great view of the garden and downtown LA. Our bed was not extremely comfortable, but not awful either. The gardens were beautiful.","May 18, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"3.5","$218"
"hotel_125","hotel_1260","What an Experience This review is a bit belated. We stayed one Saturday night at the Kyoto using a $79 internet rate which included free self-parking. It was our first visit to Los Angeles in over a decade and I really wish we were able to stay longer. At check in we were upgraded to a suite. We were given the choice between an American style or Japanese style. We chose a Japanese style suite that had a view of the roof garden (just lovely!). The room had a pretty traditional living room with a sofa and t.v., 1 1/2 bath (complete with a jacuzzi tub and Japanese foot bath), a balcony with small table and chairs, and a bedroom/dining room complete with tatami mats and Japanese sliding screens. During the day, the bedroom is to be used as a dining room which has a low lying table with cushions and armrests around it. We would have liked to have had dinner using room service in that setting, but we had scheduled a turn down that would have interrupted our dinner. Upon check in, we scheduled a turn down which consisted of housekeeping pushing aside our dining table and chairs and replacing it with a futon and blankets. We checked in after a day at the convention center, we were worn out, hungry, and a bit disheveled. We quickly went down to the restaurant floor in search of some dinner. We perused the menus quickly learning that we couldn't afford to eat at the hotel. The restaurants seemed rather upscale and the entrees appeared very pricey. We were there on a $79 rate after all. So it was time to venture out into the neighborhood. The neighborhood was filled with curry houses, bakeries, gift shops, and sushi joints. We found a market that had bento boxes and specialty items in a shopping area connected to one side of the hotel. We settled on an inexpensive sushi/bento joint and then wandered over to the infamous pnkberry which we brought back to our room to enjoy. As the evening became darker, a few beggars did start to come out, but overall the neighborhood was very well populated with groups of people hanging out and eating out.We may have just been extremely tired, but we had no problem with noise. We had a great night sleeping on a futon (who would have guessed). We woke up early the next morning and checked out around 7 am. We had a fantastic stay and would love the opportunity to do it again. The room was well appointed, beautiful, and very clean. One note about parking: the self parking garage was crazy! The hotel seemed at pretty high capacity that night-touring groups, a wedding, regular guests, etc. There were no more parking slots available so they had attendants who would park your car for you once you reached the bottom level of the structure. They handed you a ticket and took over the driving. They were parking cars anywhere there was space. Since it isn't valet, there isn't a valet stand or an organized way to get your keys and car back. Luckily, we found a parking attendant on his break who was very helpful and ran all over to find our car for us. In about 10 minutes or so, we were on our way.","May 18, 2008","0","0",6,6,5,6,6,1,1,"3.5","$218"

I realize that downtown LA is not a hotspot by any means..that being said, we stayed on a Saturday for a friend's wedding and of the four places to eat in the hotel, only one was open and the menu was not very exciting. My noodle bowl was delicious but everything else was below average. Imagine my shock when for three people, the bill came to $100. That seems a bit pricey for two noodle bowls and a hamburger and some fries. We decided to get a drink before the wedding, but the bar wasn't open in the hotel until well into the evening. The rooms were average size, but the bathroom needed some upgrading. All the tiles in the shower were cracked / broken.

At the time of our booking they had an internet special which made it very well worth the money, but still at rack rates this is a safe and good place to stay.

"hotel_125","hotel_9631","Nice hotel but nothing special Although I cannot complain really as the hotel was booked as part of a prize package I won in the UK, I feel that some points are quite valid.The hotel is in downtown LA mainly in Chinatown and the business area. It is about 10 miles away from the touristy areas. I asked one of the staff where we should go to eat locally and he could not advise but did say to keep away from the missionary area which is not too far away from the hotel.I found that a car with a sat nav is a must to get around as I would have found it quite difficult to get around. Those of a nervous disposition on motorways should stay clear of the freeways as it is bedlam!As for the hotel, it is classified as a 3.5 star. I would give it a 3 star rating as I would have expected more from an american hotel. It primarily caters for Japanese tourists and business people.It is clean but was quite dated, the room was also fairly small. I would recommend you take some filter coffee and milk with you as we were only supplied one one sachet of coffee aday. Although when asked they did supply another one!We did not eat in any of the a la carte restaurants as it seemed fairly expensive.

There are so many condos, stores, and restaurans, so I can say it was safe area! For dinning, I tried a restaurant in the hotel AZALEA, their salad was really good, and they have healthy menu as well. My friend ate Lunch Buffet, it seemed nice, too. At night time, I went up to Garden Level, there was beautiful garden over there. I wish I could eat at Japanese restaurant in front of the garden next time. it will be nice view from the restaurant.Anyway, I had a good time at this hotel.

Although we weren't at the hotel so often, we had an awesome time when we were there. The fruit and water table by the pool made our sunbathing experience much more luxe! Fantastic! The location was great, easy to find, just by the freeway. We didn't hear anything of the traffick to our room! The room was really modern and stylish! The aircondition was great! We want to give credit to the cleaning personnell who always cleaned our room so nicely!! It was a friendly gesture that they came to the rooms in the afternoon to ask wheather we wanted new towels.

"hotel_126","hotel_4219","Contemporary Classic I had a very enjoyable stay at the Luxe on Sunset. The staff know what they are doing, the rooms are large, the beds are extremely comfortable (never slept as well in a hotel), the pool is just large enough to do laps, the bathroom was pretty much as big as any I've seen in most 5 star hotels, and the decor is comtemporary classic, with earth tones and strong square shapes. The restaurant is good, but not excellent. I tend to judge on the classic caesar salad with chicken. The chicken was over cooked/dry. The service at the spa is very professional, and welcoming. The pool is salt water, which is becoming the norm. The conceirge was able to let me know about a local but competing restaurant for breakfast, which I did enjoy. I also sat in the bar one night for dinner, and the bartender was excellent.There was only on issue, which was the band that I've been told plays Tuesday and Thursday. I could clearly hear them in my room, and I was a distance from them. Luckily they only played until 10:30 PM. They were good, but it was distracting that I could hear them in my room. Also I could hear every word in the hall (they might want to consider sound proof doors).

"hotel_126","hotel_3940","Luv the Luxe A sparkling gem of an oasis. The setting and location are perfect. The two hotel buildings are seperated by a hilly incline which is an easy walk or drive up the hill with the sparkling and beautifully appointed pool on the upper level. A few rooms overlook the freeway, but most overlook the pool and gorgeous surroundings. The room was very large, quiet, and extremely well appointed. The decor and furniture are definitely not IKEA, like some of the other reviewers seemed to think. The staff, valets, and waiters treated us superbly-with prices in line with any major US city-valet included at $21/day. The Luxe is far superior to most hotels in this price range anywhere.

"hotel_126","hotel_3128","Treated like second class citizen I purchased a two night stay at the Luxe through Sky Auction for my wife's birthday. We checked out after the first night. I booked a king size room. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that no rooms were available at the time we arrive approximately 12 noon. however we were told to come back later and we would be taken care of. We returned about 6 pm and was assigned a room. We entered the large room that was pleasantly decorated. However it had two standard size beds. Both my wife and I have leg problems and it makes in nearly impossible to sleep in a standard size bed. When I called the front desk, I was told that I would be called back in 15 minutes with a resolution. After about 30 minutes I was called to be told there were no other rooms available and there wasn't anything we could do. I called housekeeping to get a few extra pillows to help brace our legs and was told they would be right up. After 30 minutes we called the front desk and their response was that we would be called in 10 minutes with the location of our requested pillows. 30 minutes pasted and no pillows arrived. We called the front desk again and a few minutes later pillows arrived. Unfortunately the pillows had wet pillow cases. My wife took the pillows to the front desk and asked if the clerk would like to sleep with wet pillows. About 20 minutes later new pillows with dry cases arrived about 90 minutes after the first request. The room had one robe in the closet (the robe was shabby with the lining all torn) we asked the representative how delivered the pillow if we could have a second robe and the response was no only suites can have two robes and if we wanted one we would need to call the front desk.The next morning after a very restless night of sleep we checked out. The clerk at the desk hardly acknowledged are presence and never asked why were checking out early or if we had a pleasant stay.I would urge people to avoid the Luxe.","Aug 10, 2008","0","0",2,5,6,4,3,2,1,"3.5","$267"
"hotel_126","hotel_6078","The steepest hill in hotels! I last stayed in the Luxe in 2004 when I had a pleasant few days. After reading some reviews on this site, I was concerned that the place had gone downhill, however I took the chance as I wanted somewhere with a balcony (to smoke) along with a restaurant and bar.I shouldn't have worried. Unfortunately it seems that people are more likely to write a review after a negative stay - I feel that positive stays deserve a review also!Let's start with Customer Service. I could not fault it at all. Unfortunately (through no fault of the hotel, they got the wrong booking information) I was put into a standard room rather than the Jr Exec Suite that I booked. I mentioned this at the front desk and spoke to the desk manager to apologised profusely for the issue but mentioned that they were fully booked that evening. He promised to sort it the next day. It was sorted the next day without bother. I went out and when I returned I had a new room with all my cases moved over. The suite was great. Extremely spacious with additional seating, huge bed and desk to work upon. The bathroom was also large with a sunken bath and a shower that could take at least four in comfort if you are so inclined (I did want to try it out but couldn't find another three people to join me :)Unfortunately my AC stopped working on the first night in my new room, just as a wedding started outside my window. I had to open the window to get some air into the room but just as the wedding music was making me stir crazy, the maintainance man fixed my AC - again, great service - fixed within 30 mins.As for food, it is quite expensive (well for the US anyway), but it was okay. Some dishes were great, others less so but the guys in the restaurant were incredibly friendly and polite. Likewise all the staff!Parking is a pain. Valet parking is compulsory at $25 or so per day, but again the valet team were incredibly quick and efficient - less than five minutes to get the car from turning up at the front desk.So what was bad? Nothing really, only a few really picky grumbles. Firstly whilst their website and the general hotel sites such as travelocity and hotels.com state they have smoking rooms, all rooms are non smoking. Not a problem if you get a room with a patio or balcony, but I had neither. Mind you, the 20 yard walk outside was far better than the 10 minute hikes I have had in previous hotels!Another problem was with the events. Rooms in the lower complete that are odd will tend to overlook the party area. Not a problem if you don't go to bed until later as they tended to be over by 10:30, but for early sleepers it can get quite noisy.The hotel is also split with the lower complex with restaurant and event areas, and the upper area with spa and pool. Rooms are at both locations but they are split by the steepest hotel hill in the world. Seriously, this baby must by 1:4 and 30-40 yards long! You can get a ride up to the top, but having to tip someone just to get to your room can be frustrating.The location is a little out of the way however (given good LA traffic) you can get to Santa Monica, Hollywood etc.. in a few mins. The place is right on the corner of Sunset and 405 so you can get anywhere easily - just don't try it in the morning and always take the garage exit to get to the highway!So all in all, a very pleasant stay and I will definitely be back if only to enjoy the excellent, polite and friendly staff that the Luxe employs - thanks to you all!","Jul 21, 2008","0","0",5,6,4,6,6,6,6,"3.5","$267"

"hotel_126","hotel_9045","Mixed Bag at the Luxe We recently spent six nights at the Luxe, located off Sunset Blvd. and the 405 Freeway. As we frequently travel with our small dog on business we were pleased at their open dog policy and had no complaints about how we were treated. We booked a Junior Suite (a large room with a seating area - no doors in between). The room was comfortable and had an open sliding door to a grassy area outside - perfect for walking the dog and relaxing outdoors. Rooms and grounds appear well maintained. Service was enthusiastic and very polite, but somewhat spotty - our bags took about an hour to arrive from the main lobby. Wireless internet - there is no wired internet - is spotty and cannot totally be relied upon.There are two main problems with the hotel. The first is that it is located up a steep hill right off of Sunset Blvd. This means that joggers and dog-walkers will have a hard time. We drove about a half mile to a less trafficked area for exercise. The second problem is that the hotel is on two separate levels, separated by quite a bit of steep hill. The main lobby and some rooms are located in the lower level. Another set of rooms, including ours, and the spa are located at an upper level. The only connection between levels is walking up and down the hill on a road, waiting for a sporadic hotel shuttle ride or driving up and down and having the valets handle your car. As we had a lot of business to do at the lower level - we were interviewing prospective staff in the hotel bar and restaurant areas - we found this very inconvenient. On the positive side, location is excellent for driving. The hotel is one minute from the 405 freeway and quite near some excellent parks - including the little known but lovely Will Rogers State Park.We would return to this hotel again, if we could make sure we were given a room on the lower level","Apr 13, 2008","1","1",5,1,5,4,5,4,3,"3.5","$267"

The pool area was also very nice.I found that all staff (valets, front-desk staff, housekeeping, room service) were friendly and efficient.

I found the food to be of a decent quality, good portions and also reasonably priced.Personally, I thought the location of the hotel was v convenient - particularly with the 405 freeway being so close-by.

"hotel_126","hotel_5556","The Luxe is great The Luxe on Sunset is a great hotel - the staff is friendly and helpful and the location is excellent. The rooms were large, a little sparsely furnished but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom large. We received a coupon for a complimentary glass of wine our first night which was appreciated. The food, as it is at most hotels was only okay and overpriced. Skip the toast and coffee breakfast for 12 bucks and walk the 10 minutes to Barrington Ave in Brentwood - a lovely walk along Sunset with beautiful houses to look at and have breakfast at one of the 2 bakeries or Starbucks - for a lot less money. The hotel offers a shuttle service, but to a very limited area - Brentwood, which is a very easy walk, the UCLA area and the Getty Center. The Luxe has a sister hotel on Rodeo drive and since most people want to go to that area, it would be nice if the shuttle ran between the hotels, but it does not - and it is only about a mile out of their three mile radius the shuttle travels.

As I first walked down the dark hallways, the light fixtures were full of dead bugs!I complained and was offered to change rooms. After looking at the alternative, I chose to stay in my current room because I did not want to listen to the freeway noise all night. I asked for a housekeeper to come by. I explained the problems (fortunately I speed some Spanish) and tipped her in advance. After shopping I returned with some spot remover and applied it to the carpets, and most of the spots came out.

"hotel_126","hotel_1162","Nice Stay My husband and I stayed in the Jr. Executive suite Rm 319 for the weekend and we had a great time. My husband surprised me with stay here next to the Spa, which was right outside out patio. The bed was very comfortable although the bed frame looked like an IKEA special, the comfort more than made up for that minor detail. We spent some time in the sauna, right outside the spa and across from our sliding glass doors. The bathroom is huge, separate shower, and tub has jacuzzi jets. The jacuzzi tub was the highlight of our stay, simply awesome. Since we live nearby and just wanted to relax, we had dinner at the hotel, which was of course pricey but not more than what is expected. Room service was efficient and friendly. I read some negative reviews and I believe that many probably have merit, but our stay was enjoyable.

"hotel_126","hotel_9636","It's the little things that count This is the second time this year I've stayed at The Luxe on Sunset.I agree with the reviewer that called it the little hotel that could.If they would just take the time to update/improve certain things, this hotel would be great.Pros -Great location, cool vibe, huge rooms and bathrooms. Cons -Valet parking takes too long, no hotel shuttle service anywhere, thin walls, front desk staff needs to be trained on basic hotel knowledge.The concirege never returned my calls and then went home for the evening leaving us to find a restaurant and make a reservation, when I asked for help from the front desk staff they could not name ONE Mexican restaurant in the area!The front desk staff has no knowledge of the hotel's spa. They will make a reservation for you, but not inform you they will charge you 100% if you cancel, we had to talk to the front desk manager to get things fixed.Little things like burned out lights in the room,the wrong room service menu in the welcome folder, forgotten turn down service, dead batteries in the remote controls, tub not draining the entire weekend and the air conditioning shutting off in the middle of the night and not one person knowing how to reset it. (this is a common occurance at the hotel as it happened in June as well)Mind you this all took place in a Executive Juinor Suite.I would stay here again, as I like the interior and location, but it does get to be a pain when you have to call to the front desk every 30 minutes to remind them of something.The front desk manager did reduce my room rate for all the trouble, but if they just got it together this hotel could be Great!","Nov 13, 2007","5","4",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3.5","$267"

"hotel_126","hotel_9955","You get more than you pay for... I travel to L.A. every couple of months, and have been reluctant to try this hotel due to somewhat mixed , although mostly acceptable reviews. My wife and I were in town last weekend to attend the Genesis concert at the Hollywood Bowl with clients, so I was looking for something close to the Wilshire Park N' Ride for concert purposes, and also near the Getty Center, where we had lunch the next day. The Luxe (and the Angelino next door) fit the bill, but having had a so-so experience at the latter, I decided to give the Luxe a shot. I will say that things started out a little rocky. We had a car/room package and I had trouble getting the hotel reservations department to respond to my inquiries for confirmation and pickup of the car. After too much effort on my part, things were finally sorted out the day prior to my arrival. (General Manager-this is the one department that needs to get it's act together!) Arriving on Sunset Boulevard, a tiny sign--easily missed--in front of an equally well-concealed driveway, leads uphill to an pull-through entry court for valet parking. Clearly, this is NOT The Peninsula, however, they have done a decent job updating an old but spacious facility. Like other reviewers, I do think they could use a bit more polish on the apple--this was an IKEA quality re-do, not Roche-Bobois; although that is clearly the look they are going for. The lobby and entry areas look very promising, with nice decor and lighting. Very chic. But how about replacing the old steel room doors, mouldings, and bathroom fixtures? These have a patina of use that draws attention to what hasn't been updated. The long and overly dark hallways to the rooms are trying for a cool attitude, but really come off as long and overly dark. That is a shame because all of these things consprire to cheapen an otherwise stylish decor. The biggest issue I have with this hotel is in the details; for example: it's nice idea to have HD flat screens mounted on the walls...but there isn't an HD signal coming to them so every channel looks distorted due to the expanded aspect ratio of the flat screens...springing for HD service would solve that. Our room had an ill-fitted front door that would not close tightly, letting in lots of noise from the hallways. Walls, as others have mentioned, are a bit thin but noise from adjacent rooms is not that obtrusive. That being said, all the basic ingredients for success are present: the rooms have lovely new carpeting, nice decor, good bedding, decent baths, and are huge! The grounds and common areas, especially the outdoor seating areas for the lounge and restaurant, are lovely. One would not realize the 405 is 200 feet away unless on the fringes of the property. The valet parking was very responsive and at $22 is well below the rate for most hotels in L.A. (As for those who've quibbled about tipping the valets repeatedly...go stay at a Motel 6, for god's sake!) This is is L.A. get over it. I practically had to stuff money in their hands as it was; they all seemed reluctant to accept a tip.The restaurant is small but well-appointed. We had good service and a leisurely breakfast there, although the kitchen did not seem to know what eggs over easy are supposed to look like. Prices are reasonable for Los Angeles.The true highlight here is the staff, which from the front to the back of the house, were absolutely warm, gracious, and helpful. No L.A. attitude here. We arrived a bit early and were offered a complimentary glass of wine while waiting for our room to be checked by the housekeeping supervisor. No less than 3 people called or came by the room to be sure everything was in order. A welcome bag of dried fruit and nuts in the room from the marketing director was a nice touch...it will score her some future business for sure! I really do intend this as a very positive review. For the location, price, and quality, you'd be hard pressed to touch this elsewhere in L.A. Unfortunately, it's easy to nit-pick the Luxe, because SO much is right that you know a little more money and work invested in the facilities would make this place even finer. Sure, it's not a 5 star, but you're treated like a 5 star guest. The low-key, elegant surroundings have such a private, clubby feel, that you forget the bargain rates and come to expect everything to actually BE 5 star quality. That's how good it is. In the $200-$350 price range in Los Angeles, the location and overall experience simply cannot be beaten. I can honestly say I got way more than I paid for...I can't wait to return.","Oct 16, 2007","9","9",6,5,6,5,6,6,5,"3.5","$267"
"hotel_126","hotel_2364","Loved The Luxe We stayed at the Luxe from August 4 through to August 11 and we loved it so much we came back at the end of August for another week. We are Australians travelling through LA. Upon hearing that we were returning to the Luxe all the staff were genuinely thankful and kept thanking us for coming back. The Luxe is a beautiful boutique hotel, very clean and well maintained. We prefer the smaller no name hotels and we found this one perfect. The staff are all so helpful and friendly, always say hello to you whether it be the front desk staff to the housekeeping to the valet. As per the previous review we thought $22 parking was enough and didn't tip and we were never treated rudely, the valet were alwasy friendly and we never waited long for the car. Although the room service menu isn't huge the food is nice and reasonably priced. They have a room service menu, and in restaurant menu and a poolside menu - loved getting food and drinks by the pool. The pool area was just really nice and relaxing, never too busy we always got a bed. They refresh the towels several times during the day. The pool is heated so is a nice temperature no matter what time of day and have nice music playing up there (not loud). There is a steep walk to get to the pool from the front of the hotel but they have a golf cart giving rides to and from the pool for those who don't want to walk. They also have a tennis court and provide rackets and balls. Our room was just the basic room and was very big and roomy. The beds were extremely comfortable and had plenty of pillows. The rooms are just decorated really nicely nad browns and beiges and nice pictures of shells. There is a flat screen TV with cable. They also provide free wifi throughout the hotel, as well as having and business centre where you can use computers and printers free of charge. The bathroom was very nice and also roomy. The rooms are kept extremely clean and housekeeping came through everyday. Our room on our first stay was located above the valter parking area but never had a problem with noise of cars or people. The hotel is located on Sunset Blvd, on the border of Brentwood which is an extremely upscale neighbourhood (mostly gated streets). The neighbourhood is extremely safe to walk through and we regularly took walks to the local shops (called Brent-Air) for milk and such. One time Jennifer Garner was there while we were getting some dinner! (Also, staying at the hotel was Sopranos and Bad Boys actor Joe Pantoliano). The hotel is located directly off the 405 freeway and although it is very close, we could never hear any traffic noise at all. Being close to the 405 means is it very easy access to where you want to go. The hotel is located about a 10 minute drive to Beverly Hills to the east and about 10 minutes west to Pacific Coast Hwy in Santa Monica. It is in a excellent, safe location and would definately stay here on our next trip to LA (if only we could afford to live in Brentwood we would!). We cannot say enough positive things about the Luxe. On average the hotel was about $200US per night and was well worth the money for the area. To me, safety is extremely important in where I stay and this area cannot be beat. If you find something wrong with this hotel you are the kind of person who will find something wrong with any hotel, no matter the price or star rating.","Sep 3, 2007","8","8",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"3.5","$267"

Room was lovely, quiet and well fitted out although no lift between floors and we were on the top floor of 2. Staff couldn't be more helpful but housekeeping does need to be checked! Staff very helpful and gave us good directions when needed. WE only had breakfast which was well priced and OK on service. The hotel has been well refurbished and the pool was great.

"hotel_126","hotel_6667","Disaster We stayed at the Luxe, a hotel near our home, due to a plumbing problem at our house. When I arrived, the person at the front desk decided, based on my appearance (I came in late, from work, and in informal clothing) that my husband and I should be relegated to a room on the far level of the hotel. I was told I would be driven up, as I was very tired, but when I went to go get the shuttle, I was told I would have to drive myself up. (My husband and I arrived separately). On the upper level, there was only valet parking, which was fine, but I should have been told that. Also, the parking level was on the third floor, and my room, on the fourth floor . There was no elevator. (I was not told this either). I had to carry my computer and a heavy bag upstairs myself. I had asked for a room with queen beds, and was told there were not any, which I believe was not true. The next day I left in the early morning and returned in a couple of hours. (I had requested and had been given late check-out). I went to sleep. Twice, hotel employees attempted to enter my room, although there was a Privacy hanger placed on the door. Both times, my room door was opened, but the person could not enter since the door was chained. The staff did not respect the sign and the hotel had failed to advise staff members of the late check-out. After complaining, more than once, the hotel made a partial adjustment on the bill. The hotel is beautiful and new, but we were very disappointed with the poor service and bad treatment on the part of the staff. We hope this was an isolated incident.","Jul 24, 2007","6","2",5,5,2,6,2,2,6,"3.5","$267"
"hotel_126","hotel_1897","Nice, but Huge room - almost uncomfortably so - for a solo traveler (over 600 sqft); nice amenities; separate shower booth, etc.The hotel consists of 2 building (main and the spa tower). I was assigned to the latter, and you would like a ride from the main tower because of the steep uphill (the hotel does offer a ride). Internet - can be improved (wireless).Valet parking - takes long because short-staffed. Breakfast - need a car to the nearest Starbucks, so you'd probably eat at the hotel restaurant (about $20). To get on Fwy 405, you need to make a sharp left from the hotel on the busy Sunset Blvd. (coming back to the hotel is no problem).","Jul 20, 2007","7","4",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3.5","$267"
"hotel_126","hotel_7939","Lovely, serene and comfy Sadly, we needed to go to L.A. on a moment's notice to go to a family funeral. Our stay at the Luxe Bel-Air made our trip very relaxing and comforting. We had a king room overlooking the front drive, in the lower building. Furniture and decor was very West Elm or Bo Concept style. Giant, comfy bed, about a dozen pillows, white-chocolate brown-chrome color scheme, sleek iPod dock style alarm clock, flat screen TV. Did not hear street noise.I'm very familiar with LA, and even though I don't like Bev Hills or Bel Air at all, this was a great location - Spitting distance to the freeway. Hotel is right next to UCLA-Westwood and halfway between Beaches and Melrose-WeHo-Farmer's Market-Museum areas. Also, reasonable drive to the Valley. Service was always kind and responsive. Front desk staff was always friendly, if not incredibly knowledgeable about local dining recos. (They all seemed new or not from area.) We always got our car from the valet within 5 minutes. No one had their hand out.The hotel is on a hill, so one building is up a steep hill. We always found valets to take us up to pool area at upper building via golf cart if we didn't feel like walking it. One afternoon, 7 of my local relatives came over (4 little kids, 3 adults) so the kids could swim and eat lunch, and the hotel staff were very gracious. No one questioned whether the kids were guests, etc. One valet even gave the kids a zig-zag Disney tram ride on the golf cart to and from pool. Prompt response to request for extra towels. Service in restaurant was friendly but slow, esp when you have four hungry, wet kids with you who just want chocolate milk, hot dogs, fries and burgers! (Otherwise service for breakfast was very prompt, esp one morning we told them we were in a hurry.)We booked through Expedia, and did not get the breakfast-included plan, so we did not pay top dollar, but it was still above our usual lodging budget. Plus, they charge you $22-night mandatory valet parking! Yikes, But, considering the circumstances, I do not regret our decision. Our only complaints were the mandatory parking charges, the bathroom needed more towel hooks (a common deficiency in hotels all over, I notice), and a teeny-tiny closet.P.S. Mazel tov to the girl who was having her Bat Mitzvah party there Sunday night! Fun to watch from a distance.","Jul 11, 2007","6","5",6,6,5,6,6,6,1,"3.5","$267"
"hotel_126","hotel_6926","Missing attention to detail I recently stayed at the Luxe Hotel-Bel Air for my first time. Furnished nicely, though everything seems to be painted olive drab green. I was pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded to a suite, although it was on the 2nd floor over a rather noisy driveway valet area. Lots of doors slamming, loud voices etc. While the room was clean, comfortable and well decorated. Finding things as simple as a light swtich was a chore, the maid had turned down the bed and turned on a number lights none of which worked with a wall switch. Lack of convenient plugs to charge a cell phone or laptop shows the age of the original construction. The attention to detail to such things as no shampoo or lotion in the bathroom, a remote control thatwas inoperative, all of which can be rectified with a quick phone call to housekeepking but really shouldn't be nescessary at this level of a facility. The bathroom lighting was not well suited for a bathroom difficult to see to shave, and would have been awful for applying make up if I had my wife with me. Nice marble in the shower but a motel 6 shower head that was not high enough for a 6' tall person.They do have excellent wireless internet, which was free (as it should be). Surprised to not find a daily newspaper at my door although they claim to offer it on their website (again attention to detail). Lastly I requested an airport pickup and drop off through the concierge, both which were prompt and courteous (and extra cost), but handled by an outside service and not operated by the hotel, hence the return to the airport was in a town car that smelled like old ashtray.","Jun 29, 2007","5","5",3,4,4,4,4,4,6,"3.5","$267"

Several wall outlet covers were falling off, the iPod docking clock/alarm was broken, and the walls were fairly thin.

"hotel_126","hotel_8483","The Little Hotel that Could I just stayed at the Luxe for one nite (vacation travel) -- thought the place was pretty appealing and also thought - if they could just put a bit more money into it - it could really be a little gem. Our room was initially a poolside view, second floor in the upper building - the room had a nice little balcony and you could not hear any noise from the 405, it was quite charming. Room furnishings were fine by me (but the refrigerator looked like it came out of someone's dorm room) We did hear a loud hum/motor come on and I think it was the airconditioning units above us up on the roof - I think if they could find a way to dampen this sound it would be really good, as if you stayed here in hot weather and that was cycling on/off all the time it could be quite annoying.The shower handle came off when I tried to use it - we called maintenance and within 5 minutes someone was there to take a look at it. He explained he wouldn't be able to fix it immediately and that we would have to move to another room - again I was surprised by the speed - within another 5 minutes someone came up to move us - my husband asked this time for a 'city view' as he is a former LA resident and thought that would be nice. While the city side rooms do not have balcony's, and you can hear a little highway noise, the view is pretty amazing for anyone who would want it. I think if you were there on business you might not want to stay in the upper building, as you have to go down to the lower building for breakfast, bar, lobby etc etc and if you are in a hurry you might not want to walk down or take the golf cart shuttle. Our package came with breakfast - food was fine, not great, but the outdoor eating area is very nice. The best part about this place is truly the staff - they were all very pleasant and helpful. The next best thing for me was the pool -- room was fine - I think with a tiny bit more upgrading it could quite the joint!","May 15, 2007","3","3",5,4,6,5,6,6,1,"3.5","$267"

If you need silence to sleep this may not be the place for you as you can hear the freeway. 2) Parking costs $22 a day which is not uncommon in LA, however during the day no self parking is permitted...so on top of the charge, I had to tip the valet to park my car.Unable to rate the restaurants or pool / spa as I really only used the room as a crashpad.I might stay at this hotel again... i'd say it was above average except for the noise.","Feb 22, 2007","1","1",4,5,5,5,5,5,1,"3.5","$267"

I didn't expect too much but since I think I got an excellent rate of US$160 per night, I wasn't expecting The Ritz.The staff are friendly enough and I don't recall seeing any of the cleaning staff during my stay. The room size was very nice - two good sized queen beds and a separate bathroom and toilet. Overall, I was very pleased with the hotel itself.However, when I stayed there it just happened to be a wedding party of some sort. My room was facing the rearside of the hotel overlooking the outdoor dining area and at the back there is some kind of hall or room for private parties. They made a hell of a noise while I was jetlagged and such - this was a Thursday night. That party went on in to the early hours and even shutting the windows didn't help. So just be careful there are no parties happening at the time of stay.It's a little out of the way if you don't have a car so only stay here if you have rented one.

The decor was very modern which I enjoyed. A nice change from Marriott, Sheraton, etc. The bedding was very comfortable.

My older son who is 6'1 really appreciated that the roll a way was a real twin mattress and not one of those mattresses that folds in half. We were all very comfortable. The free wireless Internet connection was very strong and we were able to have 3 laptops connected to the Internet at once. The bathroom was beautiful with travertine floors and shower/tub. The bathroom is average size but has an upgraded sink and hardware. The bathroom was very clean - no mold/mildew. There is lots of counterspace.The pool was being renovated so it was not available, but the staff had mentioned that they had arranged for guests to use another pool elsewhere (at UCLA I believe?).The parking was $25 which I thought was steep, but this is LA. Beware that when leaving the hotel, it is almost impossible to go east on Sunset. You have to go west and make a u-turn so leave a few extra minutes.Overall, a nice stay, and I would definitely stay again. I told them I was touring UCLA so they gave me the UCLA rate which I think was about $25 cheeper, so try to get a discount if you can.","Jul 15, 2006","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3.5","$267"
"hotel_126","hotel_3218","Nice room but ammenities and service lacking My husband and I stayed here while attending a wedding (not on site) over the weekend. After reading some of the reviews, we asked for a renovated room. They added $10 to the price for a renovated room.Our room was huge. Nice furnishings and decor. There was even a kitchen in the room, and we had not requested one. Nice wide flatscreen tv mounted to the wall.Discovered that our shower was broken. The knob that you pull to get the shower to turn on had broken off. We called down to the front desk, and they promised to get somebody to fix it. It was fixed by the time we returned from the wedding. Inconvenient.We requested room service for breakfast the next morning. Not only did it not arrive at the time we requested, but I noticed that nobody even picked up our request (left on the door) until that morning. They did get the order in and prepared quickly but another minor inconvience.Upon checking out, I asked if we could use the business center to print out our airplane boarding pass. The center was occupied, but the front desk offered to print them out for us which was nice.","Apr 3, 2006","0","0",5,5,1,5,1,3,1,"3.5","$267"

I was torn between the Hilton and the Sheraton, but I relied on the reviews from this website and was satisfied with my choice. The Staff was friendly. The Hotel was beautiful. The room was large and clean. It was a really nice room. The view was also lovely. I only booked the room for one nite, but when it was time to checkout I was not ready to go. There wasn't a lot of noise, like at other hotels. It you are going to Universal Studios or Universal City Walk, it is the closest hotel. You can actually walk to Universal City Walk or take the shuttle. I am very cheap, but I think I got a good deal. I regret that once again I forgot my camera, and didn't take pictures.

When one is expected, we tend not to give one.We entered our room and were pleasantly surprised by the size and nice appointments. It was an alcove room, which was an upgrade.The far wall was all windows. The view was incredible.The only time I heard another guest was from our restroom. The bedroom was extrememely quiet and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the linens were just as amazing.Check out was a breeze.My only complaints were the distance we had to walk from the elevator and that the water pressure in the shower was very low.

"hotel_130","hotel_9770","Beware the Bedbugs I stayed at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City the week of November 17, 2008 for a business trip. My initial impression of the hotel was favorable, as the staff were very courteous, the room was spacious and I received a complimentary fruit basket on my first night there. However, upon waking up the first morning, I found bed bugs in my bed. This was a horrifying and unwelcome surprise at 5:30 AM. I immediately called the front desk and was put on hold for 10 minutes, after which I explained the situation to the night supervisor and requested to be given another room immediately. During this conversation with the night supervisor, at no time did she apologize, although she did agree to provide another room by 6:30 AM. Upon moving to my new room, I inspected the bed carefully and found that while the sheets appeared to be clean, under the mattress, on the dust ruffle and around the headboard there was a great deal of dirt, dust and human hair. It was obvious the full bedding had not been changed or cleaned in some time. I did try to reach the hotel manager, and he did try to contact me during my stay, but we missed each other as I was in meetings most of the time there. I will follow up with a letter to him about the situation and give him a chance to respond, but as of right now, no discount was given to me on my bill and the only apology I received was from the front desk clerk when I went down to exchange room keys. My recommendation is that if you stay at this hotel, you should carefully check the bedding before going to sleep.","Nov 24, 2008","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$233"

The air was not on in the room and our thermostat read 90 degrees, it took hours for it to cool down. My bf sat on the bed and the bead was broken, the box spring was split in half. we called the front desk and they said they could put us on another floor which we did not want to do b/c we were already unpacked and had booked our rooms next to one another. They said they would send someone up to exchange it, never happend. So we just slept on it. One of guests went to get into the bed and a nasty bottle of lotion was in the sheets- obviosly the sheets were not changed. she requested her sheets to be changed and someone came up and gave her the sheets but he said I dont do sheets she had to change them herself. This is all on day 1- next day we woke up for early morning plans and there was no hot water- no one was able to shower until that evening.

"hotel_130","hotel_9322","Fantastic hotel - couldn't have asked for more!!! My husband and I and our 3 children just recently stayed at the Hilton in Universal City whilst we were visiting the US. The hotel was fantastic!!! Best location for visiting Universal studios and for seeing the sights of LA (we did have a car though). Universal studios was across the road so we had no worries about trying to get through the LA traffic to get there on time. Universal City was next door and that was fantastic for dinners, lots of child friendly restaurants and shops and we felt very safe strolling through the area at night. There was a free shuttle back to the hotel if we wanted to use it rather than walking, we did take advantage of that on a few nights after we had been walking all day!! The room itself was great - large, clean and great views! We were worried as we had two rooms and wanted interconnecting but that was no problem which was a great relief. We stayed on the executive level which included a free continental breakfast each day which was fantastic! Nice and healthy - fresh fruit, cereal, coffee, toast, yoghurt etc..Great start to the day.I was really happy that we stayed at this hotel it was the first hotel we stayed at on our holiday and we returned to it on our last night before leaving the US.

"hotel_130","hotel_6981","Couldn't have been more accomodating Decided to attend my High School reunion being held at the Sheraton, but liked the Hilton better, so decided to stay there for that night. I needed a double-bed room, as I needed to bring my disabled mother (whom I care for) and we need to have our own beds.The hotel was very busy that Saturday, and when we checked in, the desk clerk said they only had a room with a king bed...NO WAY! I had reserved a double bed room!, I explained, as I pointed to my mother waiting at the side in her wheelchair.The desk clerk got my drift, and was very understanding. She began punching in buttons on her computer and making calls, and wha-lah, a recently vacated room popped up. Yeah!The only complaint is that the air conditioning did not seem to work...could not adjust cooler or more fan circulation. The bellhop said he could try to get us a fan (accomodating and extremely nice man), but apparently, none was to be found.I ordered room service for Mom and then talked with the desk. They said that if I left them my cell number, they would call me if Mom needed me, and that they would alert security that there was a disabled person in our room (in case of emergency). So nice! After I left to attend the reunion, Mom's dinner was delivered (that person was helpful with getting her to the table and helping with her food preparation), and they later did a physical check-in with her, with a complimentary fruit basket in hand, just to be sure she was O.K. That was above and beyond the call of duty!!! I was so gratefull for their attentiveness to our needs, and that because of that, I was allowed to have a carefree night out (which is seldom, when you are a full-time caregiver!). Everyone, including the bellman who kept Mom company while I retreived our car upon leaving, was exceptionally kind, friendly, professional and accomodating!Thank you, Hilton Hotel!!!KB EdwardsPorter Ranch, CA","Oct 16, 2008","3","3",5,4,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_1981","Very nice hotel, but get a car! I stayed at the Universal City Hilton from Oct 1- 5 for a conference and was pleased overall with the hotel itself. I didn't eat at the hotel but the food (especially the seafood buffet) looked absolutely delicious! We had some issues in our room with the phone and the air conditioning but other than that, our view was fantastic and the room VERY spacious. The staff was EXCELLENT. All were extremely helpful and friendly except one lady at the front desk who was not very interested in our complaints concerning the phone/air. Too bad I can't remember her name. Anyway, Billy the bartender was the absolute best! It still ticks me off when I stay in hotels of this caliber but still have to pay for wireless internet. It's either $9.95 per day in room, or $3.00 a minute in the business center.The walk to the metro is close by although down a steep hill so if you have knee problems or are disabled, this will be a little difficult. We took a L.A. tour that picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel. That was convenient. Other than CitiWalk/Universal Studios, there isn't anything else within walking distance of the hotel, unfortunately. You would definitely need to rent a car or use the Metro because the cabs are really expensive due to the never ending L.A. traffic!Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, however, the next time I am in L.A., I prefer to stay in a hotel that is downtown.","Oct 14, 2008","3","3",5,5,4,5,4,5,3,"4","$233"

Went to City Walk every night for dining  shopping (again using the shuttle).Went we spoke to the conciege about other site seeing they asked us to hire a car but me  my husband were not confident driving in the USA. Instead we saw many sites by using the LA subway (Metro). Went to Santa Monica Beach - Long Beach - Downtown - Walk Of Fame all using public transport  was very easy!! So do not listen to the conciege when they insist on hiring a car as it can all be done by the metro  bus. Wouls have gone to Venice Beach if we had time as well.We had access to continental breakfast  Drinks  Snacks between 5-7pm every evening on the executive floor which was handy.The rest of the time was spent in the Pool  Hot Tub. As we went when there was a heatwave the temp of the pool was not so bad but i can imagine is being cold if the weather is!! But the hot tub at the end of the day was amazing after a day of site seeing!!Overall a very enjoyable stay  I will highly reccomend this hotel, book executive room if you can!!TIPSCan go to walk of fame  see Hollywood Sign by subway (metro) only one metro stop (hollywood  Highland) from Universal City. Also Long Beach by Metro (can take 45 minutes) but you only have to change Metro once at 7th Street to Long Beach (Blue Line)Santo Monica we got off at 7th Street (Macy's)  got the Big Blue Bus to Santa Monica beach which took just under 1 hour.","Oct 10, 2008","1","1",4,6,6,5,4,4,1,"4","$233"

Only downside were the exorbitant charges for even short local phone calls and internet access. Everyone knows hotels love to charge for any extras, but their prices were outragous and we simply couldn't avoid them due to crcumstances.

We arrived late and left early, so I didn't really see much of the hotel. There is a $17 self-parking charge for the garage, as with many places.A couple of snafus during my stay: The remote control for the TV didn't work... maybe the batteries were dead? Normally this would be a big deal, but it was late and I was tired, so I just read e-mail and went to bed. Then during the night, staff slid a hotel receipt with no numbers under my door... then replaced it with a receipt with no letterhead. Turns out the night staff had printed out the receipts before doing the audit (according to the beleaguered morning clerk) and so we had to go to the desk to check out in the morning. Frankly, the morning clerk could have been a bit more personable and less grumpy.The room was fine... I'm sure I'll stay here again despite the quirks.

We were met at check in by an amazing group of staff, who were friendly and very helpful. We had booked an executive floor room with two double beds. The room was great very big and clean. The bathroom was spotless and came with amenities, towels and bathrobes. Upon arrival the room contained a basket with numerous sweets, fruit etx, which was a nice touch. In the evening the hotel provides a turn down service for executive floor guests, which was pretty cool considering they leave little bags of MMs on your pillow :)Although the room itself was great, the hotel is showing its age, the lobby was a little dated as were the common areas. The lifts were really slow and took there time in getting us to the 23 floor. The executive lounge was great, we had breakfast there most mornings and they provide a wide selection of cereals, fruit, tea/coffee etc, as well as papers. The staff were great. We also enjoyed the free soda and cookies each evening :). Althought the lounge had amazing views of the surrounding area, it was very dated and had a used feeling. The room itself had clearly been a bed room previous and really could do with somoe updating. It was also pretty small, but all in all we loved it!One morning we had breakfast in the lobby restaurant, which was great but we found some of the cups to be dirty and once again it appeared to be a little dated.

The front desk staff was extremely helpful and accommodating, helping us with a minor room annoyance and a room upgrade.

The pool and exercise room was great, clean, not crowded and well staffed.It is located a very short walk from Universal Citywalk and the Universal Studios Tour and Park-rides...VERY NICE!!!

We drove to downtown LA (grauman's chinese theatre) in 10 minutes, and were at Rodeo Dr. within 15.

But here are a few things I want to mention regarding the hotel.First, if you are a smoker, I want to let you know that all smoking rooms are only on the 5th floor! Kind of sucks if you ask me. Also, you do get a very nice complimentary basket in your room that has water, fruit, cookies, and cheese  crackers.I felt that they were understaffed for a holiday weekend. It took forever for them to answer the front desk phone. And when we were changing rooms it took them forever to get someone up stairs to bring us the new keys, so we ended up leaving. The nice thing the hotel did was they never rushed us out of the previous room and held the other room for us until we got back later that evening. They were really nice just understaffed.I must say I was a bit baffled that we did not have a room service menu in our room. I had to call room service for them to bring me one and then when they did they first only brought me the breakfast menu that you hang on your door the night before. I had to tell them I already had that I need the binder with the full menu.The valet were extremely nice and helpful! They were always happy to help. We never had a problem asking them for directions to somewhere, they just printed them right out for us. They also suggested a wonderful local place that serves breakfast and lunch only. It's called Good Neighbor. I highly recommend eating there at least once while you are in town. Great food, not expensive at all, and the atmosphere is so friendly. As for the location of the hotel. You really do not have to wait for the Universal Studio shuttle! It's less than a 5 minute walk. You are litterally right across the street from it! Now as for the metro, it is a hike. You have to walk all the way down the hill and cross the intersection to get there. The walk down isn't bad but the walk up is not fun at all! That is a very very very step hill! Now there is a shuttle at the bottom of the hill that will bring you up (drops off at the Universal Studio entrance) and down the hill. I highly recommend taking the shuttle back up. Overall I was not impressed with the hotel, but the staff was friendly. Nothing spectacular just a clean nice place to stay while on vacation.","Sep 2, 2008","1","1",4,4,4,4,5,5,1,"4","$233"

The only benifit was the free breakfast and soft drinks. But other guests were getting the free breakfast that were staying on the other floors so no idea how this worked?!!!In all we had a good stay in this hotel BUT....... there was a convention going on and the hotel was FULL of police, security people and loads of rude business people. Our kids were shuffed and pushed on several occassions!!Location for Universal you couldn't get better. lots of places to eat at city walk and very near the metro.Over all i would stay here again but not with a young family.","Aug 24, 2008","2","2",4,6,6,6,6,6,2,"4","$233"

Whole room needs an update. Bathroom was very roomy. We had access to the Executive Lounge (also needs an update). Do not waste your money on the upgrade. Cold cereal and sweet rolls for breakfast and 2 hot snacks at night with cheese and fruit. For the extra $30-$40 per night you can get a real breakfast. Also, the lounge was so packed while we were there we had to stand and eat.The hotel is very convenient to Universal Studios and City Walk. They have a shuttle they share with the Sheraton that comes every 10-15 minutes.Next time I would stay at the Sheraton which was just updated.","Aug 21, 2008","4","3",4,3,5,3,4,4,4,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_7815","Friendliest staff! I went to the Hilton Universal City earlier this year for a few days away from England. I'm not a huge fan of the Universal City theme park scene myself, but chose the hotel because of a good price deal. I was a little dubious about the fact it was a Universal City hotel, and was a little worried it would be tacky. Not at all. Arriving at the hotel blearly eyed after the 11 hour flight I was greeted by friendly staff who got me to my room in no time! The hotel restaurant serves decently priced (and excellent) Mandarin cuisine, with the friendliest waiting staff I have come across in a long time. The highlight of the stay had to be the warmth of the valet parking staff - they knew me and my car, always greeted me and were very welcoming each time I returned to the hotel. I was actually pleasantly surprised by Universal City Walk too, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel (or a shuttle bus ride away). On top of the usual theme park shops, there are also a fair few decent places to shop (if you're into California-esque surfer type clothes...maybe not for designer labels). The hotel and its location is excellent for families. There are many kid-friendly places to eat in City Walk should young children not necessarily favour the Mandarin cuisine, plus the hotel is within easy reach of anywhere in LA really with a car.The room itself was spacious and clean.Overall I really enjoyed staying here. I easily settled into the Californian lifestyle within 5 days here with all the friendly, relaxed (but professional) staff. Didn't want to leave for the hustle bustle of London at all! Easily could have done another week.","Aug 15, 2008","2","2",6,5,5,5,5,6,5,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_6054","Great hotel - brilliant location! Stayed at Hilton Universal as part of my honeymoon this year and would definitely recommend it. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was lovely. Our room was bigger than average, bright and spacious. Only ate breakfast at the hotel, but this was reasonably priced with plenty of choice for a buffet breakfast. The hotel is linked to Universal Studios, so there is a handy shuttle bus which runs every 15 minutes to Universal itself, which is a ten minute walk away. This is great, as Universal's City Walk is attatched to the park, where there's numerous shops and restaurants. This means that there's always somewhere to go in the evening, which is safe and is in walking distance of the hotel. The hotel is also a short work from the underground metro station and just off the main freeway if you are driving. Overall, a great hotel in a great location. Only downside is that the lifts can be extremely slow at busy times. Would totally recommend a stay here","Aug 14, 2008","2","2",5,5,6,4,6,5,4,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_9959","Great Hotel We had stayed here two years ago, and returned because of its' proximity to the Gibson Amphitheatre ( we had tickets to the Teen Choice Awards). They have recently added a small take-away coffee shop (breakfast pastries, coffee, fruit, ice-cream) that is a great addition to the hotel.  We found the hotel to be in an excellent position, whether driving (literally two minutes off the freeway ) or using the subway, which is at the bottom of the hill, to get around . Rooms are large. We overlooked the Studios and over to Burbank ,with the Mountains in the distance. The views with all the lights on at night, and then the sun coming up in the morning were fantastic. Beds were very comfy, with nice linens. Plenty of towels in the bathrooms. We also had two safes in the room - a small one with a turnkey and another larger one with a punch code. Huge range of restaurants to choose from at CityWalk, which can be reached by a 5 minute walk, or wait for a tram at the front door. There was a large convention going on while we were there, but we heard no noise from any rooms during our stay.  Lots of self-parking space, although valet is available is you want. All staff we met were friendly and courteous. So glad we decided to go back to the Hilton Universal City.","Aug 10, 2008","2","2",5,5,6,5,6,5,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_1556","Loved the Hilton The Hilton in Universal City was a great choice for us. We travelled to LA in June as a young couple for sightseeing. The Hilton had everything and more you want in a hotel. The rooms were a good size and nice, with great amenities. The beds were comfortable and I have never had such good house keeping. The place was sooooo clean and refreshed everyday after house keeping. After being out for 10 hours at a time, it was so nice to come home to a clean room. The only negative was it was expensive in the business centre to use the internet.As for location, we found Universal City to be fine. We loved that we were close to the Citywalk which had a movie theatre, shops and restaurants everywhere. It was really easy after a long day out to go somewhere close by for dinner. As for getting around LA, the hotel is very close to a train station which is only one stop to Hollywood Boulevard. From there we used a tourist hop on hop off bus ($30each for a 24hr ticket - they will bargin) which took us to Beverly Hills, Melrose Ave and Farmers Market. Other than that we used public buses to get to Santa Monica/Venice Beach and West Hollywood. Buses are easy enough to use and are safe. AND yes it is up a big hill!!! I had read this on trip advisor before we went but really come on people lets not be lazy you can walk it and we did. But if you don't like walking there is a shuttle that takes you from the bottom of the hill the Citywalk.Overall I would have no hesitation staying here again.","Jul 25, 2008","3","3",5,6,5,6,4,5,4,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_5367","Solid Hilton Property, Having stayed at Hilton properties worldwide I would say this one rates about average. That's not to say there is anything wrong with it, but it doesn't do anything to stand out from the Hilton crowd.The hotel is well equipped, has a good breakfast and buffet lunch/dinner throughout the day. The gym is small but perfectly adequate and the rooms themselves are nice.Where this hotel could improve is the staffing, every attempt to query or dispute something you are unhappy with is done unprofessinally and in cases makes you feel like you are a liar. For example, I stayed at this hotel twice, the first time I had a rate inclusive of parking, on subsequent stay the hotel tried to charge me for parking. When I raised a query, the manager had a 10 minute disagreement with me before finally picking up the phone to HHonors and finding out he was wrong. Although the problem was resolved, the attitude of the staff and several of the management staff left me unhappy.On a positive note, the concierge team in the Executive lounge are excellent.","Jul 22, 2008","4","4",5,6,4,6,3,6,4,"4","$233"

There are two great things about this hotel - proximity to Universal Studios and their abundance of good food at their buffet dinners and breakfast on Sunday!The rooms look tired and need updated - including the tvs. The shower had very little pressure and was disappointing. The staff was luke warm with the worst being the check in desk. Room service was actually good with good service and good food.

"hotel_130","hotel_7450","Don't stay on the Executive Level We recently stayed at the Hilton to be close to Universal Studios. They have a shuttle service that picks up about every 10 minutes to take you to Universal Studios/City Walk which was very nice. The hotel has a nice lobby, but the rooms could just use a little bit of updating. Our first problem was the early check in at 3:00p.m. It did not happen-we had to sit around for 1 hour before our room was ready. This was hard with 3 kids. We were tired and just wanted to relax in our room. The front desk clerks never seemed happy-but the valets were always cheerful.The other problem we had was staying on the Executive Level. Our room and elevator keys never worked, leaving us to have to go to the front desk 6 times to have our room/elevator keys reactivated. Every time we went to the executive lounge, we couldn't get back to our room and would then have to take the elevator down to the lobby to reactivate the keys. Just ask for a room high up, but not executive level and bring your own snacks, muffins and drinks. On a plus side, there's a coffee shop in the lobby that brews Starbucks. Also there's a nice heated pool and jacuzzi outside. We would probably stay at the Hilton again, just not on the exec. level.","Jul 13, 2008","4","2",4,4,5,6,3,4,1,"4","$233"

I think our favorite part of it was the outdoor pool area. The pool was clean and was the perfect temperature. It also had a poolside bar where you could purchase drinks and snacks. It is located in Universal city just steps away from Universal Studios and the City Walk which was awsome.

"hotel_130","hotel_1894","Perfect Location and 4 Star Service Hilton never lets us down and this hotel was not an exception to that. Stayed for 3 days and 2 nights as part of our family LA/Hollywood vacation. We had a wonderful stay at this hotel and our expectations were well met. The location is so convenient to Universal Studios Hollywood...its probably about a 15 min walking distance or about a 5 min shuttle ride. Our room faced Universal Studios and gave wonderful views of it day and night as well as a great view of the hills and nearby Burbank. We had a standard room that actually provided ample room, so it did not seem crowded. We had 2 double beds that were very comfortable with high thread count sheets and fluffy down pillows for luxurious sleeping. The entire room was very clean and pleasant. There was even a complimentary welcoming fruit and snack basket awaiting us! There was a nice desk, but we had not use for the high speed internet access, which by the way has a charge per day. There was also a small breakfast table that we utilized well. Our TV was a standard 25 inch, not an updated flat screen, but that was okay. It did its duty. The marble bathroom was spacious and clean with my favorite Crabtree  Evelyn bath and body toiletries. Housekeeping services were great. Room service was also grand and on point. We had no problems with the elevators during our stay and staff was always helpful. The parking charge was not that bad...I think it was like $17 per day.

"hotel_130","hotel_7465","It's OK, but no more than that My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hilton Universal simply because we were going to Universal Studios and for that it was perfect. It is a 5 min walk from the hotel. Plus you have the City Walk for restaurants and shopping in the evening.The hotel however is in need of a refurb. The rooms are very big but not the cleanest I have ever seen. At breakfast, I went through 5 cups one morning until I found a reasonably clean one. The breakfast was good though.One thing I didn't like was the unfriendliness of the staff. Throughout our stay there, only one member of staff was friendly and welcoming.Also didn't like the fact that someone left a packet of what looked like an illegal substance in the safe. You'd think they would have checked the safe was empty when the last lot checked out. Just goes to prove that the cleaners weren't as diligent as they should have been.I have no reason to go back there again but guess for the convenience of Universal Studios I would recommend it.","Jun 26, 2008","8","4",4,4,5,3,3,4,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_6918","Not the best choice We were going to a concert Friday night and had previously stayed at the Sherton Universal and decided this time to try what we expected to be a nicer Hotel. This turned out to be a poor decision, from the beginning the check in process took too long due to the fact that only two employees were working at check in desk and the hotel was quite busy, the next problem was poor communication from the staff, we were initially told that we could take a complimentary shuttle over to the Universal lot , we walked out to take the shuttle and were give three different responses to where and when the shuttle would be there, after waiting for 20 minutes we asked the same person that had told us at check in about the shuttle status and he advised us to walk because he didnt think they where allowing the shuttle up due to amount of traffic; so with 15 minutes to spare we had to start walking down the dark pathway which only has a partial sidewalk so you are basically walking in the lane of traffic (the walk is only about 5 minutes but it is not pedestrian friendly); the television had a poor signal, the ice machine was not working on our executive floor and the elevators are extremely slow. I wont rate it as terrible because the room was nice and clean, however it was not as smooth of a stay as expected and based on the price we paid I think we will skip this Hotel next time around and would suggest the same to others.","Jun 8, 2008","7","3",3,5,3,5,2,3,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_6400","Elevators Don't Work!!!! I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE if it was just about the service. The staff was professional to a tee, and really went above and beyond the call of duty.HOWEVER, the problem with this hotel is not the people, it is the absolutely ATROCIOUS standards of upkeep with the essentials of maintanence. During my weeklong stay, I would say there were at least 4 (FOUR!!) during which the elevators did not work properly. There were two days where the elevators did not seem to work at all. No amount of smiling or free breakfast vouchers can make up for the fact that I was late to important consultations with by business partners. It reflected poorly on myself and my reputation in my professional life. I was offered 50% off of my room rate for the last two nights of my stay, but declined. If the hotel did not feel non-working ELEVATORS a sufficient reason for a full comp, I felt it my duty to simply pay and never return again.I have heard from others that not only do the elevators have problems on a frequent basis, but there have been numerous problems with the hot water (OR LACK OF IT!!). I didn't experience any such problems, so I can only go on what I've heard from others who've stayed here in that case.The location is beautiful, the building is beautiful, and the staff are wonderful. But the bottom line remains: The Elevators don't work, and the maintenance staff seems ill-equipped to fix this problem anytime soon. Reserve at your own risk!!!","Jun 5, 2008","5","1",3,6,6,5,5,5,3,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_1300","Great location, you must visit! Forgive me if this review is a little long, this is my first time writing a review!Tip number 1!- For airport transfers hire a town car. It is a fixed price and very comfortable. it costs about $95, however the taxi can work out alot more on the meter, especially if you hit traffic!We stayed for 4 nights at the start of May. It was our first time in LA and I must say everything is so far apart, it takes alot of time [and money] to get around. However the location of the Hilton is perfect for Universal Studios (the shuttle picks up from right outside the hotel and drops off right outside city walk). Also Hollywood is quite close.Ok now the hotel is a good standard. When I arrived check in was very quick and there was no waiting around whatsoeverTip 2- It is well worth joining the HHonours reward scheme. You get lots of freebies including quick check in/out and a complementary paper delivered to your door.Our room was on the executive floor, which was about $33 extra per night. May I say it is well worth doing this in my opinion. First of all the executive floors are to the top of the hotel so you have a much nicer view. Secondly, your executive upgrade includes access to the executive lounge. This provides breakfast and afternoon snacks. Breakfast includes every type of cold food you can think of. Afternoon snacks include fruit and a choice of 2 hot snacks. There were things like potato croqets andspring rolls. Although not eneough for a big dinner it definately filled the gap and worth doing for an afternoon snack in between meals. Considering the breakfast downstairs is about $18 each per day it is worth upgrading. Also the people in the executive lounge were so helpful with any queeries we had, its like your own concierge desk.The room quality was good, I understand what people are saying about updating the rooms, they certainly wernt contemporary. However, the Hilton seems to get away with this, as it forms part of the identity of the hotel (just like going to a stately home for example). Bed was huge and view was very nice. Bathroom was well equipped and modern. Everything was very clean. Room service is very good (twice per day).The resturant buffet downstairs was disapointing. This wasnt because of the food. We went to the seafood and lobster buffet which was $38pp. The organisation was not very good at all. By that I mean there were crouds of people, maybee 20 or 30 crouding around the front of the resturant as you come in, not waiting to be seated, just standing around! This ment you are constantly walking round them when trying to get some food. It would have only taken the front of house to have a word with them for them to move, but they seemed happy to let them stay there for about half an hour, seemingly doing nothing! This ruined the dining experience for us and certainly wasnt worth the money. Food quality was good and lots of variety. Warning though, they automatically add 15% grats on to the bill, which I think is a bit cheaky, and I would be inclined to take it off if you have any problems, as you are already paying alot of money. The bill came to $96 and we didnt drink alcohol!General facilities were very good. What I noticed was that the pool area wasnt crouded at all, and seemed most of the time like an exclusive pool. The jaquzzi was very hot though! took me about 10 minutes to get in! There is a quiet area one floor up from the reception, business centre on the entrance to the pool area and gym. All facilities were to a good standard. There is a transport desk, which will help you with any queeries for trips and general transport.If you are visiting LA for the first time, or indeed America like we were it is worth booking this hotel. You'll definately tell the difference between this and a basic 'travelodge' type hotel. Definately book this over the Sharaton, which was $100 extra per night! and looked like a dump compared to the Hilton.Price wise the rooms were $249 per night including TAX for a king exclusive room. Some may think a little pricy, which it is, but worth it if its your first time as you get food included and lots of advice and support to plan your holiday.We had a couple of bad experiences with room service (coming in at 6am without knocking) and people being loud in the middle of the night (the room had a connecting door therefore not very well sound protected from the next room. Therefore we got some extra points added to our account.Any questions please ask!","May 31, 2008","7","7",5,5,6,6,4,6,5,"4","$233"

Its got a free shuttle bus to it but there is no need as its only a 5mins walk. Hotel is typical Hilton and the price reflects that. Its very big, rooms are clean and big but slightly dated and can be a bit cheesy. Staff are super friendly - from bellboys to reception to car park attendant. I asked the bellboy about prices for the theme park and not only did he go out of his way to find out but he also gave me vouchers for $8 discount off the ticket price. Requested a king bed but when we got up to the room it was 2 twins. Told the reception and they changed it within seconds with no hassle. Only thing to complain is that the parking is a bit expensive, $17 per day for self parking. They also have valet if u pay extra but there is no need as car park is right below hotel and very easy to access urself.Breakfast buffet is good but the expect to pay the usual hotel prices.

"hotel_130","hotel_2399","Amazing Service After a long trip from London we were not disappointed by the Hilton. We had read about how amazing the staff were, and it was all true! They were SO polite and helpful. Our rooms were great and it was extremely convenient for Universal Studios and CIty Walk (easy 5 min walk). Only slight gripe, was the level of air conditioning in the public areas - it was freezing!!The whole family had a great stay (including 2 teenage boys).","Apr 20, 2008","4","4",5,5,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_8408","Great Location We stayed in the Hilton for 5 days over the Easter Period and had high expectations after a stay here last year. We were certainly not disappointed and it was like returning to an old friend. The location is superb, and the free shuttle to Universal is a real life (leg) saver. Room was immaculate day in and day out with great attention to detail by the maid. The beds are just the best, so comfy its a real shock coming back home. Pool was great, never over crowded, always seating and loads of towels available. Try and stay in the executive floors as the breakfast sets you up nicely for the day. We booked early and paid in advance, in our opinion was worth every penny. Would definitely use this hotel again.","Apr 13, 2008","2","2",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_1442","Hilton Universal-Just a few small things.. I stayed at the Hilton on Sunday 3/30 for a single night. I arrived at 3 p.m. which was the check-in time I indicated on the website. The front desk clerk, Marion, was very nice  stated that the room I had reserved was not ready, so she upgraded me. However, looking at the photos on here, it appears that I got the same type of room and bath. I had a king non-smoking room, with a little entry foyer, bathroom with shower/tub combo  a little dressing area off to the side of the tub that was a dressing area with a coffeemaker.The room was very clean. I had a great view overlooking Universal, the freeway and the hills. It was very pretty at nite. I was on the floor with the executive center, and had a wonderful breakfast in the morning of fresh fruit  an english muffin. They also had pastries and cereals. The attendant there was very helpful in printing my Southwest boarding pass for me at no charge. There was also an abundance of soda and water that you could help yourself to.What missed for me was the fact that one of the toiletry bottles was 1/2 full-I think a previous traveler also mentioned running into this. The other thing that was inconvenient was that I had been hanging around the room in my robe, and there was only 1 robe in the closet. I realized I needed something in my car so threw on some clothes  went down to the garage. In that time when I returned to my room the maid had been in to turn down the bed  took my robe! I called down  it took them over a half hour to bring me a new one. The other thing that I did not notice until I went to bathe was that I only had 2 towels. No one had ever refilled the bottom shelf. I don't need a lot of towels, but if there had been 2 of us in the room that wouldn't have been good. I also found the air conditioner unit or blower unit whatever it was to be very noisy and constantly going on and off all nite. It was not condusive to sound sleeping. But, all in all, I thought this was an above average hotel and would definitely stay there again. Parking was pricey. I don't understand why you have to pay to park at a hotel you are staying at in California. There were plenty of empty spaces.","Apr 9, 2008","3","3",4,5,5,6,5,4,5,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_9206","Happy with Hilton We stayed at the Universal City Hilton for six nights. The king bed was so comfortable, even more comfortable than my own bed at home! Everything is clean and well kept. We received a complementary basket several times with fruit, water, and cookies. The bar staff at the pool were really cool and the whirlpool was much appreciated on my tired back. The only problem we encountered was at check-in, the first person we dealt with tried to overcharge me for the king room. We looked at the room first and when we returned to the front desk, we spoke to a different person who gave us the correct rate we booked at. We will be complaining to the hotel directly about that person.","Apr 8, 2008","2","1",6,6,5,6,3,6,1,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_9832","Hit and Miss The Hotel was very close to the LA Metro which was very convinent. But, You have to walk up a HUGE hill to get to the hotel. The hotel offers a shuttle service that goes from the bottom of the hill, to the hotel, and to City Walk. It only runs until 10pm. Kind of a bust....Our A/C never worked. It was sooooo hott at night. We asked the staff to take a look but nothing was ever done. The hotel was very dated and was in need of a face lift.The staff was wonderful.Room service was speedy and accuarate.

I was in awe at how the management has somehow managed to achieve the level of customer service that they have. I have never been to a hotel that had such a consistently noticeable level of courtesy. EVERY employee of this hotel that I encountered, including the bellhop, the front desk people, the housekeepers, and even the parking garage attendant had exceptional customer service skills. They must spend an incredible amount of energy educating their staff on how to interact with customers. On top of that, the bedding was very comfortable, the view was beautiful, and they had a very convenient shuttle to Universal Studios.

We arrived around 1230. I booked online for two beds and when I checked in was told it was a king size. I informed them I needed two beds and they changed it without complaint and allowed me to check in early. The room was nice and clean. Comfy beds. The window must have had some caulk missing, as it whistled from the wind, but not too irritating. Would recommend to my friends. We paid $17 a day for parking in addition to room costs.

"hotel_130","hotel_4809","Ok Stay My friend and I stayed at the Hilton 3/7 and 3/8 for its convenience to Universal Studios. This is a long one!Let me start off with the positive points:The staff (all that we encountered) were very helpful and friendly. We arrived late (about 12 AM) due to a delayed flight, so there wasn't anyone else checking in...no complaints there, the process was fast and easy. We had room 1767 which had a beautiful view of the mountains, valley and also overlooked Universal City Walk. Beds were comfortable, although the pillows were a bit too poofy for me, but it's all a matter of preference. The shuttle to Universal runs every 15 minutes like clockwork and we (luckily) never had to wait more than 5 minutes for it. Saturday night the 7:30 shuttle was packed (it picks up people at the Sheraton too), so some people had to stand, but it's only about a 5 minute ride (if that long) to the park. There was a 7:45 concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre that night, so I'm sure that had something to do with the full bus. The down side is that the shuttle stops at 10PM, but City Walk night clubs are open until 2 or 2:30 AM. There is a taxi stop at the front of City Walk. They charge $10.00 to go up the hill...pricey, but worth it if you're in heels and/or have had a few drinks!. Otherwise, the hotel is walkable. The negative points were:Bathtub/shower and sink had a very sluggish drain, not totally stopped up, just slow. I thought the plug was down, but it wasn't. The bathtub faucet constantly ran unless you used force to turn the water off. However, when doing that you notice that the fixture is loose (probably from everyone trying to shut off the water!)...was a bit disappointed in this as I'm sure housekeeping would be aware of this and report it. The bar had my liqueur (yay), but only one bottle!! When they ran out (I didn't drink it all...only had two drinks...really!!!), that was it. I would think they would have had another in reserve if the one they had was low. A minor issue though. After a day at Universal, we returned to our room at about 4pm to rest up and get ready for dinner and the concert, but our room was still not made up. We found the housekeeper and she explained that they had to clean the vacant rooms first. We said ok, told her she didn't need to make up our room and just asked for coffee supplies and fresh facecloths  hand towels. Another minor issue. The biggest gripe I have is with the restaurant there. We went downstairs for dinner a little before 6PM. Since there was a long line for the seafood buffet, we decided to dine off the menu. We (mistakenly) thought it would be faster since the buffet food was already prepared and the wait staff only had to do maintenance since everyone was serving themselves. We figured an hour +/- was sufficient to be done with dinner and get the shuttle to the concert (we weren't planning on eating a big meal).We were seated right away (by this time about 6:05) and we each ordered a drink. Then at about 6:10 another waitperson came over and we ordered two shrimp cocktail appetizers and two caesar salads (one chicken and one shrimp), thinking a salad could be prepared pretty quick. At about 6:20 the waitperson came back and that's when I found out there was no more of my liqueur, so I ordered a glass of wine. Drinks (one rum  coke  a glass of wine) arrived around 6:35. Appetizers arrived at about the same time as the salads, approximately 6:45. The chicken and the shrimp were very dry. All in all, extremely dissappointing for a bill that ended up being a little over $80.00!!! Sorry, but I have to continue...next morning before checkout we thought we would try the breakfast...again we avoided the buffet as we're not big eaters and the buffet was $18.00 per person. Ordering off the menu was a bit cheaper....so-o-o-o-o we ordered the 2 eggs with bacon, hasbrowns and toast (simple). I asked for eggs scrambled well. I received runny eggs and burned bacon. My friend received burned bacon and burnt toast. The waiter didn't come right back to see how things were, so we muddled through it, not really enjoying it, but too tired by this point to fuss (probably a mistake). When we ate just about all we could stomach, the waiter finally came back to serve a refill of our coffee and asked how everything was. I said not too good. He immediately said something like oh the bacon wasn't too good was it and that he would get some better bacon...I said don't bother, we're done...but off he ran...came back a little while later with bacon the way it should have been. What irked me is that he obviously seemed to know when he served us that the bacon wasn't acceptable. We didn't even want the new bacon, and didn't eat it. We just asked for the bill. The waiter credited us for the bacon. He was a very friendly person and seemed to want to help us, but maybe a bit overwhelmed?...I'm not sure. Sorry for the long story, but I'm not a picky person, and can tolerate some inconveniences. However, for the price we paid for the room (including tax approx $230.00 per night), and the rather inflated price of the meals, I would expect better quality. If I had to do it again though...I would probably stay there for the mere convenience of it. The hotel itself is very nice. I would just steer clear of the restaurant, and hope for a room with better plumbing!","Mar 10, 2008","5","3",3,4,6,4,4,4,1,"4","$233"

The check-in experience was fabulous. Linda was not only efficient and friendly, she came out from behind the counter and walked us towards the elevator, pointing out hotel highlights as we walked.We stayed in a corner room on the 22nd floor. Beautiful view! And the room was very large - I'd guess close to 500 square feet. The bed was a typical newer Hilton bed - very nice! While the furnishings appeared to be a few years old, everything was in great shape. And the fruit basket delivered to our room was nice touch.The concierge lounge is open weekends, which seems to be rare these days. Typical evening snacks and continental breakfast. But it's open all day for that cup of coffee or bottle of water.The location is perfect! Easy access to the freewway and all of L.A. And right next to Universal Studios and Citywalk.

Maybe the Sheraton is a better value. Its a $75 taxi ride from the Airport and being up on a hill, walking to things other then Universal is a bit tiring. The room is classic Hilton, but its starting to show its age. Last time we came here 5 years ago we had a nicer room and the condition of the hotel was superb. Reception and bell staff are very professional, but there is no concierge in the lobby -- you have to call them. A bit strange. They have a reasonably priced buffet for lunch. The workout room is in a temporary room but the equipment is very good. The pool is outside so its too cold to use in December.

If your business takes you to the studios this is an ideal location. If your trip is for pleasure and you plan on going to to Universal Studios look no further. This is your place.Location:See above. But, be aware that there is precious little else in the immediate vicinity of Universal Studios. To be sure, a 15 minute drive can get you to a ton of good restaurants, but the area immediately adjacent has little to recommend it.Restaurant:I've only had breakfast but it was a very good (if not inexpensive) buffet.Staff:Good folks.

This is the entertainment capital of the world after all.Parking:The garage is underground and is generally large enough to be able to drive and park comfortably.

"hotel_130","hotel_8406","Look for another hotel Yes, I'm writing this a little late in the game, but being that Christmas is coming up, I thought I better warn people. The Hilton is lovely to look at (the lobby). However, what everyone else says is true - they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING - parking, internet, you name it. Sad that such an established hotel must do this. Yes, it is close to Universal, but so is the Sheraton. In fact, if you have a car (most people do in LA - even a rental for vacation), stay somewhere else. Universal is not that hard to get to from basically anywhere in LA. Oh, and as for the fancy dining, there was none here. At breakfast (which is not complimentary unless you're one of their members) in their restaurant, they serve a very large buffet. You also have the option of choosing from their menu (super expensive!). When I went to get some raisin bread (which was not covered - a no-no when TONS of people are coming through), there were fruit flies on it. As I moved to the fruit section, they were there too! I told the manager that they had this pest problem and she said, Oh, sorry about that. Because my husband is a fair man, we went back the next morning (to give them another chance) and found the same issue. After having worked in restaurants, I can tell you that this is not just a one time problem. In fact, if this is what the staff allows the public to see, I would be absolutely TERRIFIED to see their kitchen! Wouldn't be surprised to see them on Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares soon. There were other issues - my card key for the room didn't work - had to go down to the desk THREE times. Each time they assured me it would work - yeah, right. Problems in the room with ventilation - bathroom was FREEZING - no heat in there. Their explanation was that people generally generate enough heat from their hot showers to warm the room. Not acceptable. I've stayed at the base of a snow capped mountain that had a HEATED bathroom. Oh, and just FYI - the hotel is a HUGE place with conference rooms, restaurant, bar, etc. The problem with this is that during the holidays every company under the sun has their Christmas party here or there is some huge convention or another celebrating here as well. I was told that this was normal around this time of year. Problem? There were SO MANY people in the lobby and the hallways (leading to the restaurant and garage) that we had to push our way through them just to get to the garage! Before we checked out, when I asked to speak to the manager about our whole experience, she was always at a meeting, or away from her office. I felt so strongly about speaking to someone in authority, that I left my contact info for the manager to reach me upon checking out. Yeah, it's almost a year later and I'm still waiting for that call. I guess the customer is not most important at the Hilton. Nice. I've actuallly stayed at Sheraton Universal and they had an OUTSTANDING buffet. It was so well maintained and fresh that I asked for the restaurant manager just to compliment him on the fantastic job he and his staff were doing. That was a couple of years ago. Perhaps they're still just as good...","Dec 8, 2007","4","2",2,4,3,3,2,3,2,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_10017","Pay for it! We stayed at the Hilton as it was near to Universal Studios with our 5 year old. The Hilton was the last of the 4 hotels we stayed at during our 2 week trip to the US West Coast, so we are comparing our hotels .... Even though we had an executive room, I was surprised that we had to pay for internet. Sneakily the computers were located in the business area on the ground floor and we were not able to access the computer in the executive lounge.Likewise drinks during cocktail hour were not complimentary as it had been at other hotels during our trip to the US.The room was large, but our twin beds were the smallest we had slept in during this trip.The bathroom products were however one of the best we had.There is a shuttle service between the Hilton, Universal Walk and the Sheraton which was handy as it's on a side of a hill and a bit of a struggle to walk it.It's clean, on the glamour side, nice restaurant, the closest to Universal Studios, however if I wasn't booking it due to its close proximity to Universal, I would not have stayed here.","Nov 26, 2007","4","3",4,5,5,5,4,4,4,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_4828","A Fabulous Hotel! As a frequent business and leisure traveler, I have stayed at many a hotel. This is one of the best hotel experiences that my family and I have ever had! Official check-in time was not until 3:00 but we were able to get a room before noon as we arrived early. The desk clerk took the time to give us very detailed and helpful information about the hotel and its amenities. Our room was clean, had nice bedding, furniture and a wonderful view. Twice during our 5-night stay, we received a basket full of fruit, cookies and other goodies. Because I am a Hilton Honors member, my family received a free continental breakfast and evening goodies (fruit, hors d'oeuvres, soft drinks, etc.) every day which allowed us to save a considerable amount of money. However, we did experience the hotel restaurant's breakfast and luncheon buffets and the food was quite good. The hotel is just minutes from Universal Studios and the Citywalk with a free shuttle. I was most impressed by the outstanding customer service. Every employee, from the outdoors staff who cheerfully and promptly opened the front doors to the cleaning staff treated us professionally and made sure that we received prompt service. Indeed, I felt that the 3 of us were celebrities! I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel!","Oct 28, 2007","6","6",6,6,6,6,6,6,4,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_4514","Come here and feel like a star I stayed at the Hilton back in June because my friend and I wanted to go to Universal Studios after our visit to Disneyland.Right as I arrived at the hotel, I was put in vacation mode. The location is very nice. It's isolated at the top of a hill, away from noisy traffic. I got there through Super Shuttle and right as I got off, a greeter asked for my name and led me to the check-in counter. My friend and I are young and we weren't exactly dressed our best that day but we were still treated with respect. I was there 2 hours before check-in time but they gave me a room right away with no hassle. The elevators that take you up to your room were dark and slow. Nothing major but just a slight inconvenience. If you have to meet someone at a set time, plan a few extra minutes for the elevator to arrive.The room we had was great. Our view wasn't fantastic but it was nice enough since we didn't put in a special request. It overlooked the parking lot of Universal Studios. We also saw part of the theme park. The furnishings in the room were nice, clean, modern, and very inviting. The size was also amazing. We had a standard, non corner room but the size was still larger than the standard hotel room. My room only had two people but it could easily accomodate a family of 4-5. Another nice touch is the huge windows. It let in a lot of light into the room and made it very welcoming. The bathroom is large and very clean, even cleaner than my bathroom at home. The countertop was marble and there were a lot of vanity lights. The shower stall was a good size and the showerhead is placed high up to accomodate taller guests. The toiletries that the hotel provides are Crabtree and Evelyn. You get a shower cap, mouth wash, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, hand soap, bath bar soap, and an eyeglass polishing cloth. The beds are very comfortable. King size beds for doubles rooms with high quality sheets and a lot of pillows. I would even say it might have been pillow overload. My friend and I had to plop some down in the closet when we were ready to crawl into bed at night. The next morning, we felt great and very relaxed. For breakfast, we ordered room service. I ordered the All-American breakfast and my friend had granola with yogurt. For room service, the food was very reasonably priced. It's not cheap but it was a few dollars less than you would find at other hotels. When I placed my order, I was told to expect delivery in half an hour. The wait time was actually 10 minutes. The food wasn't gourmet but it was good. If you don't feel like ordering room service breakfast, I highly recommend Saddle Ranch in Universal Citywalk. That place has great food, amazing staff, and a nice ambiance. When we ate there, our orange juice was complimentary. When we went down to start off our day at Universal Studios, the greeter at the door actually remembered my name and said good morning to me. I have never had anyone remember my last name and actually greet me by name anywhere else. An example that shows the attention to detail that they train their staff to have. The hotel has a shuttle that takes you to the theme park but it's not necessary. The walk downhill is only 7-10 minutes to get to Universal. (Little tip for Universal parkgoers: in order to avoid the long ticket lines, buy your tickets at the automated machine off to the left side of the ticket kiosks. It's in between Saddle Ranch and the Universal fountain.)I didn't use the pool but I did go to take a look. It's small but I don't think a lot of guests use it. If I ever return to Universal Studios again, I would definitely revisit the Hilton. I had a great experience there. When I was checking out, there was a short line of 3 guests waiting and the manager immediately got more staff to speed things up for the guests. PROS: large rooms, friendly staff, clean, nice beds, nice bathroom, beautiful furniture, quiet, proximity+within walking distance of Universal Studios, mp3/iPod adapter plug on clock radioCONS: honestly, nothing major that I can think of.","Oct 22, 2007","6","6",5,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$233"

The location is superb, five minutes walk to Citywalk and Universal Studios, and the metro station is straight down the hill which then takes you directly into Hollywood. We were put on the 16th floor which gave us some awesome views and our room was impeccably clean. Staff incredibly friendly and very helpful regarding our questions getting around LA. The seafood/prime rib buffet is out of this world - you have to try it if you go! Bookings recommended for that one!The pool area is fab as well, dunno why people go on about the pool not being heated, I thought it was perfect! It was very busy while we were there which resulted in delays with the lifts and we couldn't get a late check-out as requested but very minor things.

Check-in was quick and the room was above average. It was spacious and had a sofa and desk. The bath was also very nice. We joined Hilton Honors prior to booking and when we arrived to our room we had a nice basket with fruit, cookies, etc. waiting for us. The location is great. Next to Universal City Walk and a few miles from Universal Studios and Warner Bros. It also close to Hollywood. The Cafe at the hotel had a few problems so eat elsewhere if possible.All in all a great night stay and would return if we ever went toured Hollywood again.","Oct 9, 2007","4","3",5,6,5,5,5,5,1,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_6961","Nice but some probs Just stayed at this hotel for a weekend while visiting Universal Studios. Very convenient location. You can walk to the studios in 5 mins, very easy walk. Rooms are nice, beds comfortable.The weekend we stayed, they had a wedding party and were fully booked. This resulted in total meltdown for the kitchen. We ordered dinner in the restaurant which arrived an hour later. It was cold and the side was missing. I mentioned it and they said they had run out sorry! The next morning we tried the buffet breakfast and the eggs and bacon were stone cold. I complained and the waiters were very good and had the kitchen make my kids some more eggs. I'm sorry but a nice hotel like this was totally let down by the kitchen and the food was quite expensive for a bad experience. I would stay there again if I knew in advance that the hotel was not busy, as they just can't cope when it is. The elevators are extremely slow and two were broken when we were there. Otherwise a nice room with a nice pool area which would be even nicer if they heated it a little bit more. Sort the kitchen out and you would have a wonderfull hotel.","Oct 7, 2007","2","1",3,5,6,6,6,4,6,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_4111","Superb Service at the Hilton My 16 year old son and I stayed at the Hilton for four days at the end of a 2 week trip to the USA visiting East, Central and Western states. ARRIVAL:We arrived in a pre-booked taxi from Anaheim and the door staff were opening the car doors and greeting us before we even realised we had stopped at the entrance. Check-in was swift, efficient and friendly and we were in our room within 5 minutes of arrival.ROOM:We had a superb executive level room with fantastic views out across Universal Studios and the surrounding hills. Lots of space, supremely comfortable beds and pillows and a large luxury bathroom. Everything was spotlessly clean and the air-conditioning kept it cool and comfortable. Wireless hook up for the laptop was really simple and not too expensive.FOOD:A beautiful fruit basket, cookies and chocolate were placed in our room on arrival together with still and sparkling water and this was most welcome after a long day out in the Californian sunshine. Although we knew we could have taken breakfast in the executive lounge we didn't actually make use of this service as we were out and about most of the time. However, we did use room service on a couple of occasions and the food delivered was hot and of good quality. The wet and dry bars were a little pricy but did come in handy when we had settled down for the night but were in need of a quick snack or juice.SERVICE:We only had one minor maintenance problem in the bathroom during our 4 night stay and a plumber was sent within 5 minutes of reporting the leak. As soon as it was fixed, a cleaner appeared with his trolley and the bathroom was clean and spotless again within 45 minutes of reporting the problem!!! Although we had made our own itinerary before we arrived, the TRANSPORT DESK was most helpful in arranging a tour of downtown Hollywood and the Hollywood Hills for us and they were quite knowledgable regarding good places for shopping etc. They also sorted out our taxi for us on our departure day. The door staff were courteous and polite every time we left or entered the hotel and on our final day the hotel were happy to store our cases securely so that we could spend our last few hours wandering around Universal City Walk.OVERALL:Our stay at this Hilton was the icing on the cake for us. We had a fabulous time everywhere we stayed but the staff and quality of this hotel meant we didn't want to leave!TIPS:Take the regular FREE shuttle bus that travels between the hotel and Universal City Walk; although you can walk the short distance it is all uphill and during the summer months was a most uncomfortable journey on foot.Don't bother booking the VIP Universal Studios Tour. If you break down the components included you probably won't want them all and we felt really ripped off by the cost of it!","Sep 21, 2007","4","4",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$233"

Everything felt new and classy. Room service was delicious and they even rolled in a table for us...kind of romantic. The next morning, before check-out, we got a call from someone saying that we have room service, but I said that I didn't order room service. The guy on the other end of the phone said that it was an amenity room service (I guess he meant complimentary). They sent us a basket of fruit, snacks, candy, and water. That really made a lasting impression on me and we're definitely going back there soon.

Bags were brought up immediately. Bellman was very friendly and extremely helpful.  As mentioned by others, the rooms have double beds instead of queens, but the ones we stayed in were beautiful and very clean.

The rooms are updated, clean, and large. The staff members are friendly and helpful. It is a classy place.We did, however, have two problems. We booked 4 nights at one rate. We then had to cancel one night; because we changed the reservation, they wanted to almost double the rate for the entire stay. I spoke with the manager, and he honored the original rate. Also, we booked a king and adjoining queen for the kids. When we arrived, they claimed the hotel was full, and they wanted to give us two kings, not near each other. We pressed the issue, and they amazingly found two rooms together. Other than these two issues, which were resolved, we just loved our stay.","Aug 5, 2007","3","2",6,6,6,6,4,6,6,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_5573","Great Location and small but comfortable beds!!! We stayed here 3 nights July 15,16 17. We arrived on Sunday and had no problem checking in around 2pm. I was traveling with my husband and two teenage children. I requested a roll away because they don't like sleeping together, but I was informed that it was a fire code--he seemed to hesitate but didn't offer any other solution. I asked about a refrigerator and he smiled and said that I could break the seal on the minibar and remove thier items and put our items in at no charge. Parking was $17 a day--which is definately overpriced but I assume normal for the area. As soon as we pulled up a luggage cart was brought to our van and the bellman put everything on it and carted it up to our room,. Normally we do this ourself so we felt a little out of sort. It was nice but we didn't know how much to tip. The man came into our room and offered to adjust the temp and get ice, or anything else we needed. He emptied the cart and place everything in a perfect location. I was impressed but we were still alittle nervous about the bellman thing. We usually stay at Embassy Suites where you do everything yourself but there are no ESuites near Universal studios. When we came back at the end of the day there was a small tray with some fruit/cheese cracker and chocolate in our room on the table. Not sure if this was because we are Hilton Honor members or if it's part of the welcome but it was nice. Oh the beds were small but comfortable. Also, I'm a light sleeper and I didn't have any problem sleeping. I don't remember hearing any noises from anyone else near our room. The bathroom was big and roomy which was also a plus. There was a safe with a key right above the minibar which also was good, too.We needed to get to downtown hollywood to catch the shuttle to Griffith Observatory and we had decided to learn how to use the metro subway system. I asked at the front desk and they referred me to the travel desk. Everyone seemed vague about the Metro. It's like the BEST Kept SECRET. Once we figured it out it was easy to use. I knew there was a Metro entrance on the main road before we turned onto universal drive so we justed walked out of the hotel and headed for Universal drive took a left and walked down a very steep hill. I knew I wouldn't be walking back up that hill no matter what. Turned out that Universal City walk has a tram that goes from the bottom of the hill to Universal city walk and then at City walk there's a bus that drops off at Sheridan and Hilton until 10 or 10:30pm. So it worked out great we walked down the hill found the metro bought our ticket for $1.25 each and went down town to Hollywood/Vine. There was only 3 other people riding on a Sunday afternoon. No one took or even looked at our tickets but there are signs posted --big fine if your caught without a ticket. Glad we were able to eat at Johnny Rockets and board the bus to the observatory earlier than our ticket time so that we could get back and take the subway back before it got to late. With the subway being so empty I felt just a tiny bit afraid. As it turned out there was about 10 people or so when we returned, so at least there was more people around. Took the subway back back and walked over to the tram to go to cityway and then at city walk we walked to the sign that said Sheraton/Hilton bus and then we were back at the hotel.","Jul 27, 2007","6","6",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_9303","no complaints at all about the hilton los angeles universal city My husband was called on for business on the West Coast and we, his family, from the East Coast decided to tag along to see California. Some of his co-workers stayed at this hotel and gave it rave reviews. The location is key - it is right next to Universal Studios and City Walk. They have a shuttle which transports you there - shuttle leaves every 20 minutes or so. This was great to do with the kids while the husband was working. City Walk offers so many great restuarants and shops. The staff at the Hilton were beyond polite. You could not walk by an employee without them wishing you a good day/evening. They all were well trained and helpful. When we arrived, we unpacked and got our room in order and went for a nice dinner. Upon returning, we felt that the air conditioner was not as cool as we would have liked it - We tried adjusting the thermostat - but it was only blowing somewhat cool air - so we made a phone call to the front desk and within minutes a repairman was there - He said it was not fixable - and picked up the phone and immediately got us a new room! I hated to unpack - but we were to be there for almost 5 days and the AC is a must!! We moved to an equally nice room - great view of the Hills !! We were super lucky to get this new room - as the hotel was fully booked - it was the week of the 4th of July!! If we are lucky enough to return to the L.A. area - no doubt we will go back!

"hotel_130","hotel_2264","Okay for weekdays but beware of weekends here! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week long anniversary trip. The beds were nice and comfortable and I loved the Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. The walk to Universal Studios is not bad. I don't understand the comments in the past reviews about it being a long walk. The only thing we found to be a little tiring was getting up the steep steps to the walk way that you have to cross to get there but the walk overall was fine. We never took the shuttle once. The weekdays went very smoothly but by the weekend we were wishing we had stayed at another hotel for those days. The buffet they serve at Cafe Sierra comes out into the walk way that you have to go past to get to the elevators and it was packed with people, more so on the weekend then during the week. We never ate there for that reason. Always very crowded and for $36 a head there are plenty of other great places to eat in L.A. that are a lot more affordable. Another issue was the hotel pool, which was so full of children at 10:00 at night that there was not one adult in it. The hotel never bothered to fix the hot tub either during the duration of our stay so there were many unhappy couples who would have enjoyed having that since the pool was taken. But it was cornered off with yellow tape. We asked to be moved on day 6 (a Saturday) due to loud children in the room next to ours. They were so loud that my husband and I could hardly hear one another. So we called the front desk and they moved us up one floor. Curiously, they had mailing tape around the window in the first room we stayed in. For $248 a night, you would think they could do a better job of securing a window. It looked tacky and I'm not sure what the purpose of it was. But aside from those issues we had a good time. However I would not recommend this hotel to a couple without children who are seeking a quite weekend getaway. The Century Plaza in Century City is a lot nicer for a little bit more money and very couple friendly.","Jun 28, 2007","5","5",4,4,6,6,4,6,4,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_4626","ok hilton just to say that overall we enjoyed our stay at the hilton, it was close to universal and the 405 freeway. However there are a few annoying problems we paid to stay on the executive floor and found we were on the floor below which wasn`t a hardship except that the lifts were so slow!! and being a renal transplantee the stair option was not too attractive.The executive lounge facility was far too small especially in the mornings serving the two floors of executive rooms or so we thought....however when you consider the numerous upgrades people seemed to be given from other floors offering access to the lounge it felt like a macdonalds most mornings despite the excellent staff.To appreciate a fantastic executive lounge facility you should visit the hilton arc de triumph in paris - it is amazing!! and all hilton hotels should copy this format, the food and drink available was incredible.The rooms compared to the rest of the hotel were a little dated but were clean and comfortable.My family and I would stay here again for its location and freindly efficient staff.doncaster england","Jun 27, 2007","4","2",5,5,5,5,4,5,1,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_4136","Decent hotel in Universal City My husband booked the room with the Hilton directly for the 2 of us. Upon arrival , we were given a room with 2 double beds, even though we had requested a king or queen. They have no wait list , so we had to check everyday to change rooms. Finally two days later a king was available, though they had no record at all of our request! After speaking to no less than 6 people! None the less, the rooms were very clean , very spacious with decent views. Room service menu is extensive and the food was excellent (pricey, of course).The pool is very nice with an oasis like feel with lawn and cabanas , but poolside service is lacking. You have to really hunt for menus and a phone to place an order. It seems it would benefit everyone greatly to have easy access to smoothies, snacks and cocktails poolside. Nice hottub also.It is a very large hotel so there is no real personal service, and often long waits for the elevator. The location is ideal, of course, for Universal area attractions, but a long way from LAX, Hollywood and the beach. Self-park is $15 a day, valet $20 a day.Overall nice property.

The hotel and staff were great, but no less than should be expected for a hotel of the Hilton brand.

The room was large and nicely laid out, beds were comfy and bedding crisp. Bathroom was lovely, very clean. Only downside really was a stain on the carpet in the room by the side of the bed, didnt mention it though as it didnt bother me that much.

"hotel_130","hotel_5607","Brilliant stay at The Hilton! Universal City was the first stop for us on a trip from NZ to LAX/Vegas/Cabo San Lucas, so after a 12 hour flight the Hilton was bliss!About a half hour drive from the airport and check in was a breeze. We were tired so ordered room service and had an excellent burger- this was the only time we used the hotel for meals, as we spent all other time just up the road at CityWalk.Universal Studios the next day was fantastic although the 'June Haze' in LA was a little disappointing- still managed to get a bit sunburnt through! Cannot recommended the 'Front of Line' passes enough at the Studios- we were straight on all rides and spent most of the day in the park. Food inside was expensive but you could leave and go to something like Subway at CityWalk, and then head back into the park later.The best thing about the hotel is its location and closeness to Universal Studios and CityWalk. Honestly, we had the best time each night at CityWalk, eating out and popping into some bars. Its open until at least 2am each night and stores are also open until 11pm I think.Best places to eat and drink at CityWalk: Saddle Ranch Chop House (amazing T-Bone) and great bars like Howl at the Moon (something like that) and also the Brewhouse.","Jun 19, 2007","4","3",5,5,6,5,5,5,1,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_4603","Will not return We arrived around 8:00 PM on May 26th. I went to check in while my husband waited in the car. Apparently during this time a valet had asked him if we were valet parking and my husband wasn't sure what I was going to pay for. So a manager came over and informed my husband that he believed self parking was full due to three wedding receptions being held at that time so to go ahead and pay for self parking, then if the lot was full, we could valet park for a cheaper price. Well, inside I was checking in with the front desk supervisor. She was very helpful and upgraded my room for free. We booked a 2 bed room, but when she found out it was only because the website wouldn't let us book a King room due to my son being 3. She moved us to a corner King room because it had more space. She was very helpful and we thought we were off to a great start.However, everything changed once we tried to park. The self parking lot was COMPLETELY full that people weren't even parked in spaces, just anywhere. So we came back to valet to try to get the deal that the manager had told my husband about. Instead the valet driver insisted on radioing the lot to find a space. Which the lot attendant swore there were spaces even though we just checked ourselves. They INSISTED that we park in self parking and the manager was nowhere to be found. So I got out with our luggage and son and waited in the lobby for my husband while he parked. The lot attendant made him park in a place that was CLEARLY not a parking space and anyone that turned a corner wrong could hit our car. That's ridiculous...all just so we wouldn't get that deal on valet parking that a MANAGER informed us about. Upset, I went to talk to the front desk supervisor that was so helpful to me. Instead I ended up waiting 15 mins in line (I was the only one) because she was on the phone...trying to work out another guest problem. If you have a 3 year old...you know I was pushing it with him, so my husband decided to come back down after the receptions were over and move the car. I was hungry so I ordered room service, it was good and well priced for room service. Then we settled in because the next day we were waking up early to go shopping. I woke up with my arm COVERED in BED BUG BITES! I took a shower before I slept so I know it had to be bed bugs. A Hilton with bed bugs...for the prices you pay to stay in this hotel, you would think that they wouldn't have this problem. I've stayed in so many hotels from 2 stars and up and NEVER have had this problem before. Then we were hungry and wanted to try their buffet. However, it's not just a brunch buffet for guests, it's for anyone so it was PACKED. It's all in the hallways of the lobby too so it was a little interesting trying to even walk through that area. Then we found out it was priced at $32 a person!!! THAT'S RIDICULOUS! It's because they serve caviar and seafood too....well, I'm sorry I don't eat that and especially not for breakfast so why should I pay that much?I will never stay there again. I would rather stay somewhere else and drive to Universal Studios.","Jun 13, 2007","2","0",3,5,5,3,5,3,1,"4","$233"

The room was clean and the qween bed was very comfortable for my wife and I. Good choice of hotel to stay at when visiting Universal City.

"hotel_130","hotel_7796","Nice hotel Stayed at this hotel on the final leg of our road trip through California and Nevada and was not disappointed. Booked two queen beds on executive floor and were allocated a room overlooking the pool area, large, clean with nice Evelyn and Crabtree bath products with complementary breakfast and appetisers after 5.30pm and complementary fruit basket (in fact we received a second basket after 3 days stay). Nice pool, never too busy. Ate in the Sierra Cafe for the weekend buffet....fabulous if you like seafood and reasonable at $39.00 per person especially if you have large appetites. Very convenient for Universal Studios and Citywalk (for every type of meal). Did'nt bother with the hotel shuttle, the walk was about five minutes away over the pedestrian walkway and invariably we arrived there before the shuttle did. When there if it interests you try the Warner Bros VIP Tour.....great fun and a different experience from the Universal Studio Tour, you can get tickets from Warner Bros online. If you want to do the tour of the star homes thing, try Starline also online but we picked up tickets from a kiosk outside Mann's Chinese Theater, also great fun. All in all a typical Hilton experience and recommended.","Jun 3, 2007","1","1",4,5,6,6,4,5,4,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_8679","Great hotel but be careful if staying on a busy weekend! We stayed at the Hilton for the first 2 nights of our California vacation. We checked in on Saturday May 26th. Our flight arrived early so we attempted to check in early which we had requested. The clerk was very rude when we tried to check in telling us that check in time was 3:00 and check out time was at 12:00. (We tried to check in around 11am) She rudely told us their were no rooms available, that the guests had until 12 to check out and that we could go to the park and try back later. I wasn't upset that we couldnt check in early I was upset about the way I was told I couldn't. We did go to the park and tried to check in around 4:30pm. The new clerk told us at first their were no rooms available, mind you we had pre-paid for our reservation. I started to get angry because it was well after check in time to which I was told that alot of guests were checking out late. I'm sorry but thats not my problem. After alot of typing he gave us a room on the 18th floor. I liked the room, very spacious, and nice decor. Only complaint I would have about the room is the beds are very small. Received a nice fruit basket, room very clean. What I hated the most about this hotel was they have a buffet set up on the weekends right in the middle of the lobby. So when you are trying to get to and from the parking lot you have to fight crowds. There was also 3 wedding receptions being held the weekend we were staying which made the hotel very busy and crowded. We had been waiting outside for the shuttle to universal for 10 minutes before another guest told us the shuttles wouldn't come up to the Hilton because their was too much traffic from all the cars being parked for all the wedding receptions. It would have been nice if a staff member had warned us of that. Because the hotel was packed, being on a higher floor the elevator would stop at almost every floor on the way down and most of the time the elevator was too full for anyone on the lower floors to get on so I would keep that on mind if you stay on a busy weekend! All in all it's a nice hotel, decent price, great location for going to Universal Studios but probably wouldn't stay there on a crowded weekend again.","Jun 1, 2007","1","0",3,5,6,6,2,5,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_7057","Very Nice Hotel I stayed here for a convention, which was held downtown. Since I didn't like the area around the convention center, I intentionally decided to book a hotel in Universal City area. I'm glad I did. The rooms are very nice, and the breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very well prepared.There was very little noise around the hotel, mainly because the building is rather removed from the main drag. I had a wonderful view of the valley from my room.The free shuttle to Universal Citywalk was very convenient. I think this property would be perfect for someone who is visiting Universal City/Hollywood areas for leisure.Only down-side, which was mainly my own fault, is that the transportation to downtown took a long time. In retrospect, this is probably not the best choice for someone who is attending a conference downtown.","May 29, 2007","1","1",6,6,5,6,4,6,6,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_3948","Treated exceptionally well at the Hilton Universal City From the moment we stepped onto this Hilton property we were treated like valued guests. The valet service was quick and courteous. Without being asked, the valet told us about the shuttle service and other valuable bits of information to make our stay enjoyable.Robin, at the front desk, greeted us with a smile and a friendly personality. She gave us an upgraded room without asking (as we are Gold HHonors members). She also gave us information about the hotel to make our stay pleasant.We used bell service at arrival and departure, each time having Victor help us with our luggage. What a professional, courteous man he is. He was at our door within 3 minutes of calling for bell service on our departure.Other delightful experiences included a fruit/snack basket delivered to us once we were settled into our room. Also the Executive floor lounge was comfortable and well attended. We had plentiful hors d'oeuvres the first evening, and a great breakfast the next morning. If you wanted, you could make a great meal of either offering. As for the accommodations, our room was top notch. Everything was clean, stocked, and beautiful. We had a great view of the Hollywood Hills and Universal Studios. Just wonderful.This by far was the best stay at a Hilton we've had. I wish our stay were longer. This was a treat and delight.

"hotel_130","hotel_5335","Happy at first, but left very disappointed (and mad) First, I went back and forth from a 2 to 3 rating, but ultimately went with the 2. The hotel staff was excellent and extremely helpful (which is the highlight of the hotel). The room was very clean as was the bathroom and the shuttle to Universal was a great convenience (save your money and refrain from renting a vehicle - you won't need it).Now the problems... What ultimately upset me the most was the noise. We stayed on the 22nd floor and were awoken in the very early hours of the morning by what sounded like furniture being drug across the floor. We finally decided to call the front desk and were told that security would go to the floor above us to see what was happening. After 15-20 minutes and the noise only getting louder, we called back only to be told that the hotel signed a contract with a film crew and they were filming. Are you kidding me? The man at the front desk offered to change our room (yeah, right - who is going to change rooms at 3:00 in the morning?) then after I became more irritated, he told me that he wasn't the one that booked our reservation. What did that matter? We didn't care who made the reservation and that only irritated us more. If the Hilton is going to contract their hotel, they need to ensure their guests aren't affected by the noise, especially at such an early hour.Also, the food was very overpriced and just wasn't that good. Based on the prices they charge, their food should have been of a much higher quality. Drinks at the bar were also pricey and there was only one waitress, which doesn't seem like too big of a deal, but we had to wait long periods of time for service. Tips... ask if they're filming and if they are, tell them you want to be as far away from the filming as possible (only if you want sleep), eat at CityWalk (many options, food is 100% better and priced appropriately) and don't rent a vehicle because you won鈥檛 need it if you're going to stay in the area. You can get to Universal in the hotel shuttle (about every 15 minutes) and most taxi rides will cost less than what you'll pay for parking in many spots.","May 24, 2007","3","2",3,5,5,6,5,6,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_7231","Good, clean and convenient Stayed here for 4 days with my wife and two children (10 and 13) as part of a weeklong trip to California.The 15 minute ride from Burbank airport and proximity to Universal Studios made this great choice for a family vacation to the LA area. Easy access to most highways make day trips around the city easy (for LA that is).The rooms are average Hilton size, clean and comfortable. The staff is pleasant and helpful. There is a shuttle to Universal City Walk the runs every 15 minutes if you don't want to take the 10 minute walk.The only negative was the lack of hot water late one evening. This was corrected by the morning.Executive floor rooms or Hilton Gold members have access to the executive level lounge which provides a continental breakfast.

"hotel_130","hotel_8076","Good hotel, probably the best in the Universal Studios area My party of three adults (girls' week away) stayed at the Universal City Hilton between April 21-28.Location: The Hilton was convenient to Universal Studios/City Walk by walking or free shuttle. It was also convenient by car to some activities we had planned in Hollywood and Burbank. However if you are planning anything at or near the beach, it is a long drive and there seemed to be traffic at times one wouldn't consider rush hour.Check-in: Check-in was smooth, and the bell staff and valet were very friendly and helpful. Our luggage was brought up very quickly and the bellman also filled our ice bucket.Room: Judging from the hotel floor-plan and building shape, it looks like our room (1855) was among the smallest on the floor, and after having two double beds desk/chair, and reading chair, there wasn't much floor space. If I stay here again, I'll request a corner room, as they appeared to be the largest.The room was comfortable enough, but I wouldn't recommend it for three adults. The beds were full size, not queen. I had requested a roll-away, but was informed by the front desk that the hotel is not permitted to put roll-away beds in a room that already has two beds. It would've been nice to know that upon booking or checking in. The desk clerk also could not / did not offer to change us to a king room w/ roll-away, but did offer us extra sheets/blankets so that someone could sleep on the floor (unacceptable). The bed was comfortable, but the mattress sagged a bit - a little too soft for my taste.A nice touch was a fruit and cheese basket upon arrival, with some bottled water, and a second basket was left for us mid-week. We never did get the in-room safe working. It was a key safe, not electronic, and there was no key in the room. Reported to the front desk but they sent up the wrong key. It wasn't a big deal, so I didn't pursue it.Mid-week we returned very late from Disneyland to find that all three of our room keys were not working. I called the desk from the phone by the elevator and they sent security up promptly to let us in and sent up new keys shortly thereafter. Security told us our keys were probably de-magnetized in our wallet by another card, but I find it difficult to believe that would happen to all three at the same time when it had been working fine all week.Cleanliness: Housekeeping did an excellent job each day, and left plenty of towels.Overall the room was very clean and up-to-date, with the exception of the carpet. I agree with an earlier reviewer who said it turned their socks black. I too walked around for a bit with only socks, and they became quite dirty. The hotel definitely needs to invest in carpet cleaning or replacement.Dining: We used room service twice for a late dinner and ate at the breakfast buffet once.The room service food was average (except the gazpacho, which was excellent) - service above average. Everything was delivered quickly and hot. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and at $17 a good deal. There were fresh omelettes, eggs  waffles, as well as what seemed like an endless selection of other items, including fruit, cereal, pastries, side dishes, etc. After you are done with breakfast, they also give you a to-go coffee for the road. The servers at the buffet were friendly and attentive.This hotel has a substantial seafood/primerib buffet Thursday - Sunday that seems very popular with non-guests. The buffet is so extensive that it will not fit in the restaurant and it is set up on temporary tables in the lobby hallway. I had to navigate a crowded buffet line to get from the garage elevator to the room elevator. I am also not a fan of seafood so was quite turned off by the smell that filled not only the restaurant, but the lobby and lounge as well. Even if I did enjoy seafood, I wouldn't visit this buffet as it it set up in a hallway where there is a fair amount of lobby traffic walking by all the uncovered food dishes and displays.Overall this was a good hotel, and I may visit again if I have the need to be in the area. It was a good price and good location if you are planning on going on studio tours or attending television tapings. I have also stayed at the Sheraton next door, which was awful. However I wouldn't use a single room for more than two adults again.","Apr 29, 2007","2","1",5,3,5,4,4,5,2,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_8022","Not Impressed Hilton Universal Hotel was at a nice location, if one wanted to stay close to the Universal Studios and the City Walk. There were free shuttles that ran every 10-15minutes from the hotel to the Universal city walk and back. But to go anywhere else in LA, one had to rent a car.The hotel itself was not bad. The lobby was nice and well maintained, some bellmen were very polite, but not all were. The room was well laid out and looked nice but could have used a bigger TV. Bathroom was clean and everything worked. I found some questionable stains on the carpet. I felt itchy in bed and found a couple of bug bites on my legs the next morning... that was gross. Next three nights were no different... I think they may have bed bug problems.The biggest problem with the hotel was the staff. The staff who checked us in never once cracked a smile. I found that to be odd. As I mentioned, some of the bellmen were very nice and polite, but some were downright rude. Especially when we requested them to hold our luggage for an hour after we checked out so we could go and have lunch before the departure. Also, I resent the fact that they charge for the internet usage. They have highspeed internet available in each room, but you must PAY to use it. They have a business center, but once again you must PAY to use ANYTHING in there. At close to $200 bucks a night they charge their guests, I think they can afford to provide free wi-fi. The Sierra Cafe in the hotel had very nice breakfast buffet in the morning($17.00) and a very good dinner deal between 4-6pm (3 course meal for about $15.00). But once again, some the the wait staff were terrible. When we specifically asked for the dinner deal, their attitude changed immediately and our waiter pretty much forced us to order drinks. He never once came to ask us how our food was or to fill our water glasses. If you don't mind such horrible service, the food itself was very good (better than what we ate at 'wolfgang puck express' restaurant at the city walk... that was a rip off). If you are staying at this Hotel just for the Universal Studios, I think it's a decent choice, but just don't expect the best quality of service from the staff there. You may want to bring your own sheets and pillows if you are afraid of bed bugs.","Apr 24, 2007","4","2",3,3,3,3,2,2,2,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_1136","Close to the action Got a $152 dollar rate from the Hilton website which, at current 拢/$ exchange was fantastic value. Hotel details on the Hilton website give an accurate impression of the property.The hotel is right next to City Walk and Universal Studios with a free shuttle service every 15 mins. Alternatively it was an easy 10 minute walk to the theme park entrance. You feel like you're in the middle of the action throughout your stay.We had a room on 19th floor with great views over LA. Room service menu looked reasonable. Restaurant prices, as you'd expect were on the high side but the weekend seafood buffet looked superb. If you're on a budget there's a wide choice of eateries at nearby City Walk to suit every taste.The pool area was surprisingly pleasant and well-landscaped. 24 hour business facilities mean you can access the internet for a fee. Self-Parking was $15 with in/out privalages. It works out to an extra 10% of the room rate but theres little alternative and parking was, at least covered and secure.A 10 min downhill walk also gets you to the LA Metro. Next stop ($1.25 one-way and 5 min ride) is the Hollywood Walk of Fame etc. Metro is modern and a quick and easy way to access some of the city. The uphill walk back is hard work but, at certain times you can get a shuttle from the bottom of the hill to City Walk and then walk back down to the hotel.Staff were very helpful - especially with directions locally and to our next destination.This was our first Hilton stay for many years (we also had a good experience at Hilton Homewood Suites in San Diego the following week).

The place is immaculate, the rooms spacious, and the services top-notch -- something I've come NOT to expect from big corporate chain hotels. As well, the pool area (and some other outdoor areas) provided very relazing respites from an otherwise grueling weekend of meetings. My one complaint, and it's fairly significant, is that some of my belongings were stolen from one of the ballrooms where our conference was held. This happened to another conference-goer as well. So whereas the general hotel staff is excellent in every way, I am less than happy with the folks they hire to clean up the place.

This problem was taken care of instantly by our bellman. He immediately lead us to another room within minutes that was clean, large and very comfortable.  The pool was very nice with cabanas for privacy and food and drink service. The hotel's seafood buffet was pricey but worth it. Self parking was a little steep ($15.00 per day) but all the city hotels charge for parking. This hotel is extremely close to Universal. There is a free shuttle bus that picks up right in front of the hotel and takes you over to Universal/Citywalk in minutes.  We really enjoyed this hotel mainly beacause of the staff.

Although the hotel itslef is very beautiful, it is not opulent, but the staff is what made me give it 5 stars. From the second we arrived, we were greeted by no less than 4 guys at valet parking, we didn't have to lift a finger. As an Hhonors Gold Member, I received a free upgrade to an alcove room without asking. It is essentially a corner room mini-suite w/beautiful views of Universal Studios and the surrounding mountains. In addition, I had access to the VIP suite on one of the private floors (free drinks, continental breakfast, newspapers, tv's, etc). Room service was good and fast, a bellboy came to our room to get our luggage within 3 minutes of calling and held on to them free of charge well past check-out time so we could walk along the Citywalk. They also kept our car in valet well past the 24 hours at no additional charge. We had a drink in the atrium and the bartender stopped by 3 times to check on us. The staff was exceptional in my opinion.The room was roomy, clean and comfortable. The beds at this Hilton are exceptionally comfortable as well (California King). As an added bonus, we ran into and got to meet and take pictures with the lead singer and guitar player of the band we were there to see, which was a lot of fun (they were staying there also).

The location is great for Universal Studios and City walk, also for Hollywood Bowl and Boulevard (5 minutes by car) and the hotel is sparkling clean and modern. Our main problem was that we arrived at 9pm after an exhausting trip from London and were given a room that wasn't made up! This was quickly sorted out with the management, however, and we ended up in a large room on the 15th floor with two double beds and a great view to the North over Universal Studios. The room was plenty large enough for a family of four and the bathroom clean and modern with everything you need. We took breakfast every morning in the excellent restaurant. The service was first class and the buffet breakfast the best we experienced during our three weeks in California. Public areas are clean and modern although the outside pool area was a little on the small side. We took the hotel limo for a 2 hour tour around the Hollywood sites and the driver was polite and friendly, but not particularly knowledgable - reasonably priced though.

"hotel_130","hotel_6169","Great hotel Okay, I really loved this hotel. Nice sized rooms, huge bathroom with a great shower, big comfortable bed. It is nice to be close to all the restaurants of CityWalk, while mostly in a quieter area of LA.  It is about a 20-30 minute drive from the airport and only about a 10-15 minute ride to the center of Hollywood and you can avoid the freeway to do it. Also, you can drive north to Santa Monica or Malibu within 30-45 minutes depending on traffic. It is also not far from the Warner Bros studio if you are doing a tour, and not far from the Grove Mall. Anaheim/Disneyland is only a 40 minute drive also.For me, this hotel was located centrally to everything that we did for a week and I would 100% stay there again. I loved everything about it.The only downside, internet access will cost you 9.95 per day. A lot of other Hilton and Hilton family brands have complimentary wireless internet. Room service was also good, but a tad on the pricey side.","Dec 8, 2006","8","8",5,6,6,6,5,5,4,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_5612","Darwin Saved The Day My son and I were in LA and on a very tight schedule. We were leaving the Universal City Hilton and needed to print our boarding passes before arriving at the airport that evening. We would not have access to a printer for the entire day - but the website for the airline was down. I spoke with Darwin Wang at the front desk and he attempted to print them out - and even called the airline for us. Even though we were checking out, he said he would check back on the airline site for us later and we should come back and he would leave the boarding passses in an envelope for us at the front desk......And amazingly enough, he did. This was exceptional customer service. This is what makes people want to return to a hotel. We have stayed within the last two years at Hiltons in Greece, Australia and in the U.S. - and on this trip we wpent the first night in a VERY lackluster Hilton (Mission Valley San Diego) where we would never return, but Darwin Wang restored my faith in the U.S. Hiltons. Universal City Hilton highly recommended for great staffing.","Sep 9, 2006","13","11",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_2441","Great Location for Universal - Would stay again We spent two nights at the Hilton Universal City and thought it was the right choice for our family of four. We spent our first day touring Universal Studios (which was only 5 minutes away by foot or shuttle) and then had dinner in the Hollywood and Highland mall which is only 10 minutes away. So basically it was a very convenient spot.Our check in went smoothly and our room, on the Executive floor, looked like it had been recently updated. Nice size although I think it was one of the smallest on the floor. We had a large, marble bathroom but no extra sink outside (as I understand other rooms have). Good wifi service for my husband.We had booked the Executive Floor on the Hilton website for an additional $30 per day. I figured it would save us on time and $$ at the hotel restaurant for breakfast. That was true except that the hotel failed to inform us in advance that they were renovating the Executive floors and that the lounge had been moved to a very unattractive, windowless, function room on the 4th floor. I had hoped to be able to pop over for coffee, bagels, etc. while leaving my kids in the room. This wasn't possible with the 4th floor location. I also thought that the staff in the Executive Lounge was not overly friendly and seemed more like waitresses than concierges. I didn't even bother to ask them for restaurant suggestions because they seemed timid. The breakfast buffet itself was as I expected--muffins, cold cereal, bagels, pastries, fruit, coffee and juices. Hopefully the new space will be finished soon as the temporary space is really a downer.We liked the pool area (saw no algae or mold) and the availability of drinks there after a day of touring Universal. While we didn't eat in the hotel, the seafood buffet ($39.95 for adults) looked extensive and well-attended.I would chose the Hilton again and recommend it to you. Just realize that it's not perfect (they never vacuumed the elevator area carpet during our stay there) but for $180 per night including breakfast for four it was a good deal for LA.","Aug 31, 2006","14","11",5,5,6,5,6,1,5,"4","$233"

The staff were very professional and friendly. My room was lovely - it was spacious, had a very large bathroom with shower and tub, and a lovely view on the Hollywood Hills. The basket with fruit, biscuits and water was appreciated. I took some tours of LA with Starline Tours and was collected and dropped off at my hotel.

"hotel_130","hotel_8877","Just Okay We expected more from this hotel. The rooms need updating, and most of the staff were just okay. As we were allergic to the feather bedding we requested other pillows and blankets. They delilvered us the pillows and blankets and left it to us to change our own beds, we had to put all the feather bedding into the closets. Also, when a hotel advertises internet access available it does not mean free. The hotel is next to Universal. We were told by hotel staff the walk to the Universal Cily restaurants was just behind the hotel. They didn't mention that it was behind the hotel back parking lot, over a rather dark bridge across a busy road and through another parking lot. The hotel is not close to anything other than Universal, and if you are driving to the hotel and happen to arrive when there is a long line of cars waiting to get into Universal, then you are waiting in line to get to the hotel driveway. If you are spending the majority of time at Universal then the hotel is convenient, but if not then there are better locations to stay at.","Aug 21, 2006","8","6",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_9981","A Perfect Choice for us!! We chose to spend 2 nights at the Hilton after viewing this site and couldn't be happier with our choice! We knew it would be close to Universal and Hollywood so the location was just right. When I originally called (just last week--3 days prior to our trip) the only room available was an accessibility room at a rate of $169. Our family of 4 didn't mind having this room, but at check in, we mentioned that we didn't need an accessibiliy room so if something else was available, that would be fine as well.The woman checking us in couldn't have been more helpful in checking other options. Sure enough, she offered to upgrade us to a jr. suite--for no additional charge!!Our 2 sons were THRILLED to be on the 16th floor overlooking Universal. What a view!!Our room was extremely clean, the beds were heavenly and we found a lovely fruit and water basket waiting for us after our CityWalk evening visit.We easily walked to the park and even walked down the hill to take advantage of a metro ride to Hollywood Blvd.(El Capitan theater, Kodak, Grahmans, etc.)--just one stop away. So simple and convenient!!Loved the pool and the spa as well--clean and relaxing. We brought coffee and muffins (from the gift shop) there for breakfast. I only wonder why this hotel doesn't offer a coffee bar and quick/easy snack buffet for those families wanting to zip to the park. Their buffet options look beautiful, but are pricey and would take too much time for families on the go.","Aug 17, 2006","3","3",6,6,6,6,6,5,4,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_1358","Hilton Universal- A Good Choice Stayed Four nights in August, 2006, and besides for the hot water not working for a few hours one night, the stay was very nice. The staff were very friendly and helpful with info about universal and the area. Only problem was that the conssieurs were on another floor and not available to speak with. Hotel shuttle was easy ride to Universal, and parking was not an issue. Very close to the interstate and all things in Hollywood. Rode the subway to Hollywood one evening. Only a short 10 min. ride away, and felt very safe. Parked at the subway stop down the hill, a rather long walk uphill if you choose to walk.

"hotel_130","hotel_1547","Nice Hotel We stayed at the Hilton Universal having stayed there before. It is the closest hotel to universal, an easy 10 min walk away (there is also a shuttle). The only complaint we would have is the slowness of the check in staff. Not just for us but everyone it seems. There is no express here! they really need to improve their service and streamline check in. It also took 30 mins for the bellboy to collect our bags on checkout. The pool is a decent size but is in need of repair and the hot tub is even worse. This hotel needs some TLC in some places whilst others appear to have been recently refurbished. We were on the executive floor and this was in very good condition.

"hotel_130","hotel_9601","Excellent hotel and location My mom, husband and I stayed at this hotel in mid July for two nights. We had two rooms, executive floor, king beds, non smoking. We checked in around 5:00 on Sunday evening, no problems with reservations, both rooms were ready. I had requested that our rooms be near each other, my request was granted. The lady that checked us in was very friendly, she gave us one room with a Universal Studios view and one room with valley/interstate view. Rooms were very roomy, the bed was out of this world comfortable and the shower was amazing. The only negative I could find was that there was an odor in my mom's room, which the housekeeping staff told her was the new carpet (didn't look new, but they said it was), they brought her air freshner which helped for a little while. They were in the middle of remodeling, they were in and out of rooms changing out furniture, however that didn't bother us, as we weren't there. We went to the executive lounge for appetizers and drinks, when we returned we found a tray of fruit,water and cookies in our rooms. Parking wasn't an issue for us, we actually ended up in the same spot each time we came back, the only problem was that our room key wouldn't work most of the time as we used it to exit the parking garage. This is a great place to stay if your sightseeing includes the Hollywood area, it is easy access to the interstate and only about a 5 min drive. I will definitely stay here again when back in the area.","Aug 6, 2006","5","5",6,6,6,6,6,1,1,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_2344","Closest Hotel to Universal I read prior reviews and must agree with much of what I read.There are 2 hotels near Universal, the Sheraton and the Hilton.The Hilton is the closer of the 2.I understood that there was a shuttle, but we simply walked from the hotel to Universal, probably a 5 minute walk to the entrance of Universal.The hotel parking lot was huge, and I was lucky enough to find a spot on the ground level.There was a separate elevator that takes one from the parking garage to the lobby, then a different elevator that took us from the lobby to the room upstairs. To me, this is not even an issue. Upon checking in:We got there real early and a room was not available, so we just kept the bags in the car, spent the day at Universal, and checked in at night. We were actually prechecked in when we got there by the desk clerk, as he knew what room we would have, it was just that the room was not ready, as it was still before noon.The clerk told us about an upgrade, which we took , as we were entitled to the free breakfast in the business wing on the upper floors, with this upgrade. The room was enormous and quiet.The girl who eventually checked us in at night was originally from our part of the country, so we had a really nice chat with her.So, both the morning and evening check in people were well spoken, knowledgeable and friendly, which I found soothing.Some relatives took us out for the brunch at the Hilton, and it may be the most incredible buffet that you will ever see.There were all sorts of foods in the dining room, and if that was not enough, there were more choices in the hallway, in both directions.Conclusion:Great parking Great roomGreat staffGreat buffetNearest hotel to UniversalWhat's not to like?","Aug 6, 2006","6","6",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$233"

The only thing we couldn't figure out was where to self-park without a 5 minute walk to the lobby. This hotel is also a great starting point to other area attractions, including Hollywood (studio tours), Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theatre. Driving time was about 5-10 minutes.

My family which consists of 2 adults and 2 children stayed here for 2 nights in June 2006 for $159.00 a night. The service was outstanding. From the valet service, bell boys and desk help, we were made to feel very welcomed and at home. Our room, of 2 double beds, while not overly large, did have ample walking space around the beds, desk, and cabinet with TV. The room was very clean. Internet service was available for an additonal charge, as were games and movies on the TV. There was not a refrigerator in the room. The soundproofing in our room was excellent, as we never heard any noise from the surrounding rooms or hallways. The view from our floor to ceiling windows couldn't be beat. The short walk to Universal Studios and Universal City Walk made this hotel location very convenient. It took us about 8 minutes to walk to the locations. The hotel does offer a tram service, but the walk was quite easy and enjoyable. This hotel was also a great location for a visit to The American Girl Place in The Grove.

We were supposedly on a non-smoking floor but smelled the whole time. Promised deodorizing but never addressed. The hotel ran out of pillows--never heard that in my life, so no extras!! The first night and first breakfast excutive lounge was crazy and ran out of food and coffee. But, they did snap in to action and handle things better in the lounge on other two evenings/mornings.There were a lot of banquets for proms, weddings, etc. and extra guests for that. Some of the prom teens were loud and ruid.The lobby was pretty. But our room was small, old carpet (I think since opened 22 years ago!), and smelled.The bell staff, transportation desk and front desk were over friendly and helpful.The drivers of free shuttle were prompt and friendly.Definitely would never stay anywhere else to do Universal and Hollywood/Beverly Hills.

Valet just held our car for us by the front and then we self parked.Dining was strange. Buffet only in one restaurant on certain nights and the lounge area downstairs was not really a full meal. More like expensive finger foods. It is within walking distance of Universal Studios, but you have to walk partway on the street. It is marked with a little walkway though, but we had to ask for directions before leaving the hotel as it isn't marked until you are halfway to the park. Comp evening hour douerves were few.

However, there is also a free shuttle that runs about every 15 minutes. There are plenty of places to eat at City Walk. But if you plan to visit anywhere else in LA, you'll need a car.I have only a couple of complaints. The physical layout is not great--it's hard to find the elevator to the parking garage, and the pathway to Universal Studios and City Walk isn't well-marked at all. They also charge $14/day for parking (although in my case, for some reason they only charged for one day instead of 3). Finally, internet is not free.

Although my pre-paid reservation was for a room on the executive level they didn't have any available when we got there so we were in a room on another floor. (We were assured the rooms were actually the same.) We were given the key to access the executive lounge however, until I advised the front desk two days into our stay, we were not receiving the turn down service or the daily newspaper we would have received if we had actually been on the executive level which is what my reservation was for.The executive lounge had a nice continental breakfast - cereal, fruit, yogurt, pastries.... The breakfast buffet on the first floor was great too if you wanted things such as eggs, bacon, waffles and the like for breakfast. The buffet also had a wide selection of Asian foods as well as other pastries, fruits, cereals and yogurt.In the evening the lounge had appetizers.Most evenings we had dinner at the City Walk. They have a great selection there and a shuttle will take you to and from the hotel for free. Our 16th floor room was nice (although the wallpaper did show a bit of wear) and we had a great view of the 101 Freeway, the surrounding hills and Universal Studios.All in all we had an excellent stay and despite the fact that we weren't actually on the executive level like I had paid for, we had a good time.

"hotel_130","hotel_7753","Accessible to mass transport, if you'd rather not drive I stayed at the Hilton/Universal City for business reasons. It was a nice hotel, though somewhat dated. I had a room on the 10th floor with a nice view of the mountains and the freeway (with the famous LA traffic). The City Walk was quite accessible via a shuttle or by walking over. To get to the Hollywood landmarks one usually drives, but the Metro can easily get you there. There is a station just down the hill; you can walk down and cross the street. Walking back from the station is more of a challenge because of the somewhat steep incline but we learned another way: take the Universal Studios shuttle (which stops at a covered area at the bottom of the hill) to the ticket area then walk a liitle to get to the shuttle stop for the hotel, or walk over to the hotel. The concierge was able to provide a Metro Map but we had to find out about the getting back to the hotel bit on our own. The drive to the airport can be quite a long one, so make sure you have a lot of time. Overall the stay was pleasant, but not extraordinary.","Feb 13, 2006","7","4",4,4,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_7150","Perfect Location...Very Helpful Staff! We spent a week at the Hilton Universal in January. We used it as our home base for a week spent touring Southern California. The location was excellent...minutes from downtown, walking distance from City Walk/Universal Studios, and about 2 and a half hours from San Diego - where we spent a lovely day at the Zoo and then drove back to the Hilton Universal the same day. The Hotel is 10 minutes from horseback riding under the Holywood sign...the highlight of out trip. Check in was a breeze. When I went to self park the car (my choice - valet also available) my wife called from the room to tell me we had inadvertantly left a suitcase at the airport. We were staying on the Executive level and I wasted no time availing myself of the concierge services in the Executive lounge. Ma'ayan, the concierge, melted away my angst instantly. She got on the phone and spoke to her contact at American Airlines. They confirmed that they had the bag and she arranged a messenger service to deliver the bag to the hotel for a nominal fee. All this while I was relaxing in the lounge eating a danish and coffee!....Although a bit cold for the pool in January, my daughters enjoyed a late night dip in the outdoor hottub (open until midnight) after a tough day of sightseeing. There are plenty of restaurants available for dinner at CityWalk, a short walk away. Meals in the hotel were pricey for a family, but were beautifully presented and plentiful.After overeating in the Executive lounge (included in the room fee) I made good use of the on site gym. The upgrade to the executive level is well worth the fee, especially if you are traveling with kids. Mine particularly enjoyed the free daily breakfast.During your stay, I recommend visiting the 3rd street promanade in Santa Monica, Venice Beach, and taking a drive though Malibu Canyon. You can avoid Disneyland, the NBC studios tour, and the Santa Monica Pier.Enjoy!","Feb 13, 2006","135","16",5,5,1,5,1,5,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_4823","It should have been better We arrived from Texas on 12/31/05 for the Rose Bowl Game. Our check-in was fine but the next day we went shopping and upon our arrival, we had been locked out of our hotel room. (our reservation was for 6 nights using our Hilton Honor Points and the final night paying by credit card for $180.00). We were very worried as our Rose Bowl Tickets were locked in the safe inside. The girl working the desk reprogramed our cards and we were able to get back in. But, it appears that the manager, Phillipe, chose to refuse the Hilton Honors points and I spent over 6 hours trying to straighten it out. The manager tried to bill us for New Years Eve (4 times the regular cost) since it was the most expensive night of the year instead of our final night. It was only after much complaining to the corporate headquarters did anything get resolved. This hotel basically refused to even help us. We had to pay the hotel to use the internet service and to print each page to prove to them we had a Hilton Honors reservation. We booked this reservation several months in advance and I think the manager was upset that he was not able to collect payment for the 6 nights. It appears that due to the Rose Bowl, a majority of Hotels were sold out in the LA area. It was only after Hilton Corporate made several phone calls, directly to the Hotel over several days did we finally get everything organized. The manager guy, Phillipe, is very rude.I would never recommend this hotel to anyone if you are expecting a really nice hotel. Stay at the Sheraton next door. I know I will","Jan 12, 2006","10","7",4,5,1,6,1,2,1,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_6249","Mixed Review After extensive research done on this and other websites, we decided to stay at this hotel for a week on the first leg of our summer 2005 West Coast trip. We chose the concierge(club) level as the amenities offered (drinks, light food) was worth the small extra fee and afforded us the ability to have a quick breakfast or light snack during our days in Los Angeles. Note that rates for less than a week were charged at a daily rate, once we decided upon 7 nights we were given a cheaper weekly rate.The location was good. For visitors to Universal Studios, a short walk got you there in about 7 minutes. We avoided most of the LA traffic by staying here, as it was easy to find off-highway routes nearby that, with the help of a map, took us wherever we wanted to go. We did a lot of driving around and felt our location was a bit far for some trips (such as the beach) but centrally located to the highway, simplifying most other excursions.The hotel was clean, the most important criteria. As we arrived at our room we saw carpets being shampooed between guests. The room was a good size for two adults, one teenager, and one pre-teen, but kids shared a bed. I believe there was a sofa that could be pulled-out, but I'd double check that if it pertains to you. The bathroom was very clean, toiletries plentiful and of excellent quality. Robes, hairdryer, iron and board were provided. Beds were comfortable, nice linens, great pillows. Separate check-in area at main desk for concierge speeded up the process.Something to keep in mind - we were on the 22nd floor, and the noise from outside seemed a bit loud for a floor this high. We just couldn't put our finger on why until we realized, though the windows had a bolt on them to keep them closed, one of ours was open. Not only was street and park noise creeping in, but all it took was a slight push to fully open this unlocked window. We called and received immediate response from the staff. A noise issue in the next room, however, didn't seem to rate any attention at all. We called the front desk, which passed the buck to security. Luckily this was at the end of our stay, as nothing was done about the noisy neighbors.The concierge lounge area well-monitored. Guests had to sign in. Card access was required on the elevator to access these upper floors. The food choices were limited. There were light breakfast items, coffee, teas, and juices 鈥?OK for a family on the run. Water and soda was available during the day, however it was requested that you not take it from the lounge. We had no problem taking water or soda with us. Keep in mind that you have to ask for your beverages as they are kept in a refrigerator in another room. This is inconvenient, as you have to wait until staff can assist you, though they do their best to keep on top of it all. Evening choices were limited (snacks and one warm appetizer dish) and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks. Personnel in the concierge room were very helpful in getting us tickets to a studio tour, and very pleasant. In fact, one sweet lady took a liking to our children and made a special effort to give them each a small gift the last day of our stay. Per the Hilton website this service is offered Monday through Friday, however we also found the lounge staffed on the weekend.There is an easy walk down a hill to the train station that will take you throughout California's metro system. Beware of the steep walk back. It was not a problem for us, but if you have strollers, elderly or young children, wheelchairs, you would not want to attempt the hike. There are free trams and buses taking guests and park visitors up and down the hill to Universal City and/or hotels. Be prepared to wait, however, as they run slowly and fill up fast. Hollywood Boulevard is only a few stops from the hotel on the train. Fair was about $1.50 each way for this venture, per person.One negative is the lack of nearby fast food and/or supermarkets. City Walk can easily be accessed for evening dining or entertainment, however when staying for a week, that becomes repetitive. We had a rental car (definitely needed to stay at this hotel) and drove for food. There is a supermarket about a mile or so away and lots of Dollar stores. No need to carry too many supplies with you. Between the hotel offerings and these stores, it's easy to buy what you may need. There are no laundry facilities at this hotel, though they will do it for you for a fee. We searched the Internet ahead of time and found suitable laundromats within a couple miles and did our washing there. This is a big negative, however, as you must plan it into your trip. There is a pool and fitness room. Though we were unable to swim due to weather conditions, the pool was unremarkable as this is not a resort. The hotel's shop seemed limited in its offerings and hours. There is a restaurant and a separate lounge area. Though the restaurant offered elaborate themed buffets, the prices were very high. Be prepared to pay a daily parking fee of about $10 or $12.This Hilton caters mostly to the business traveler. Though we did not feel out of place as a family, they did not offer the experience a mom and dad with young children would like. If your kids are older, you may consider this hotel. Universal Studios, however, can be covered in two days. Have other plans and be ready to drive or take the train if you plan to stay here longer.We would not eliminate this hotel in the future; however it would not be our first choice. I will also be reviewing the Embassy Suites South in Garden Grove, California and the Venezia Tower at the Venetian in Las Vegas.","Jan 3, 2006","15","15",5,5,1,5,1,3,1,"4","$233"
"hotel_130","hotel_7745","Best room ever... feels like honeymoon I was in LA for holiday and was very impressed by this hotel. I was at another 2 star hotel near hollywood walk of fame cos I heard its more central. But the condition of that hotel was so horrible that I checked out after just 1 nite and moved to Hilton. It was my best decision during the trip. We got the 14th floor overlooking universal studio. Room has a great view with the best bed and bathroom. Best of all, we got the room at just slightly over $130 per nite. It is only marginally more expensive than the 2 star hotel we stayed the nite before at Hollywood. We drove, so the location was not a problem at all. Universal Studio is only 5mins walk away, or if you prefer you could catch the free shuttle provided at the hotel. Definitely recommend this hotel to all holiday and business goers - esp those who has own transport.","Dec 5, 2005","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$233"

I must admit that in some of the floors, the corridors and areas look very tired, but having noted the the reviews by others in regard to the ongoing renovation, get a room as high as you can. The rest of the hotel appeared as to the standard expected, got pastries and coffee for a few bucks just before pick up for our tour 09:00, fast efficent restaurant staff.Eat at the Universal City or locally, lots of Diners etc. Excellent location for the freeway and a 5 minute ride on the shuttle bus to Universal City Plaza.

This Hilton has also always had a nice fruit  light snack platter waiting for us when we arrive (that may be because I am in Hilton HHonors program - I'm not sure).

"hotel_130","hotel_5040","This hotel is the worst of the worst We checked into this hotel on Saturday the 3rd of September. My boyfriend had to attend an event at Universal Studios on Monday so we came up early. We called the night before to make a reservation and mentioned that we had rooms under a particular reservation. First they said they didn't have the reservation. We figured we'd sort it out when we got to the hotel and just booked a room.We got there and of course they charged us the more expensive rate. We had to get the manager on duty to come out and explain what the deal was. We gave up trying and just checked in. The hotel is kinda old and musty. Definitely bring a travel candle to get rid of the smell. We had a non smoking room but it still had this weird smell.So Sunday morning we called down to the front desk and asked them about the room situation. We had a room under a block and wanted to keep the same room. The guy said they couldn't do that so we'd have to pack up our bags and store them until a room is available at 4pm. It was 11am and we wanted to go shopping for the afternoon. No way I was going to pack up again and then move into another room. I called the manager on duty again and explained that we didn't want to have to do this. She said we could keep our things in there and she'd sort it out. So we left to go shopping for the day. We got back to the hotel after a couple of hours and decided to go for a swim. We sent up our friend to go grab some drinks from the room and when he went up we had a problem getting back into the room. The door wouldn't open. We went down to the front desk and called down from the hallway phone several times. Finally I waited at the front desk until someone made a call for someone to go up to our room because we had been waiting for 45 minutes already. They finally sent security to open the door manually. They said it was an engineering problem as the battery on the door swipe was out. After that our key card also took about 10 swipes each time before we got a green light. Oh and the hot tub is disgusting. It's brown and murky. The pool is okay. It was the saving grace.When we checked out of course, we were billed incorrectly. The manager on duty hadn't sorted out our bill so we had to stand at front desk and argue for a bit again. This hotel is a nightmare. I recommend people to not stay here. It's totally dingy and not worth over $100. Stay at another hotel close by or at the Sheraton. I'm sure it's better.","Sep 6, 2005","9","7",2,2,1,3,1,2,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_5236","Hilton Universal: An Excellent Choice We stayed at the Universal City/Los Angeles Hilton from March 14 till the 17th and on March 19th. From March 17th to March 19th we stayed at the Residence Inn San Diego. Please see my review on that hotel too.Introduction/Location:This Hilton property is located in the heart of the touristy Hollywood/Beverly Hills/Universal Studios area. The area is very nice and safe. This hotel attracts the more civilized (but not snobby) guests rather than the sloppy and messy people which are better suited for a cheap motel. You enter on Universal Hollywood Drive. There is also Sheraton property located on the same street and there is an elevator which takes you between the two hotels. There is a hotel shuttle which takes you to Universal Studios and City Walk. It runs about every 15 minutes and the trip takes no more than a minute or too. It is very convenient for travelers without a car or people who don鈥檛 want to pay the money to park at Universal. The hotel has 24 floors. We stayed on the 18th for the first part and on the 11th for the last part.Features:This hotel was built in 1986 and seems to have been renovated recently. When we were staying there I overheard one of the desk clerks telling one guest that they are replacing the carpet starting with the top floor. We were given room 1872 for the first part of our stay (March 14th-March 17th). This floor/room had newer looking carpeting which was clean and did not have any stains. The desk and night table also looked to be in good condition. There was also an armoire which contained the television, a mini bar drawer, a minibar fridge and a small safe with a key. The television had the basic US TV channels plus the standard hotel movies, internet, games, etc. Everything worked fine. There are also many banquet/meeting rooms which are used quite a bit. There were a lot of parties/conferences and functions are held at this hotel. All were kept at a reasonable level (the people here are civilized). On our last day after we returned from San Diego we were given a room on the 11th floor which was not in such a good shape. The carpet was older (but clean), the night-table/armoire was worn/scratched and the beds were quite soft and creaky. I believe this is because they had not yet replaced the carpets/beds in this room since they had been working from the top floor (24th) down. Luckily it was just for one night and we managed.Amenities:Standard Hilton amenities are present at this hotel. People who are HHonors members with high status usually get a gift of some sort. We are not members but we still received a nice fruit/snack/water tray. I believe all the guests get this, although I am not sure.On the lobby level (Fourth floor) there is a nicely equipped fitness centre which has working and new machinery such as treadmills, stair climbers, bikes, etc. The place is split into two rooms which have difference types of equipment. One room had a TV and the other had a stereo with speakers on the wall. Also on the 3rd floor is a gift shop with travellers鈥?supplies and food/drink items. The prices are quite high for the drinks so I suggest you just pick up some from a local variety store.The access door to the outdoor pool is on the first floor. You need to use your keycard to open the gate. This is to prevent non-guests from using the pool. The pool area has a large pool with shallow and deep ends as well as a smaller whirlpool which has an adjustable massage/bubble control. The whirlpool was nice and warm (actually HOT) but once you鈥檙e in for a few minutes you get adjusted to it. Both the pool and the whirlpool were clean and heated. There are towels provided for you on a table as well as a basket for used towels. Surrounding the pool are chairs for tanning and poolside resting.You must pay to park at this hotel. Self Parking in one of their two underground garages is $11 per night and $16 for valet parking. Remember, to access the self parking you must take one of the elevators near the meeting rooms as the main ones do not service the garages.Service:Right from the start I was treated with care and attentive service. Upon pulling up to the door the attendants help you with unloading your luggage as well as holding the door open for you as you enter. Staff the front desk were incredible and helped us with driving directions as well as the locations of the different attractions in the area. The travel guide suggested tours for us and helped us choose the right one. Housekeeping came to make the beds daily and to replace towels, toiletries, etc. Everyone in the hotel was always there to help you.Dining:The hotel has a restaurant called 鈥淐af茅 Sierra鈥?which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Each morning we ate the breakfast buffet there which cost $15 per person. The price was a bit steep but the breakfast buffet was so filling we didn鈥檛 eat until dinner. Some of the food included the normal breakfast food such as bacon, sausages, pancakes, eggs as well as a nice fresh fruit and 2 or 3 dim sum dishes such as shrimp dumplings and BBQ Pork buns. If you want to save yourself some money and spend your time touring the city, take the buffet for breakfast. It will keep you full until dinnertime. On Friday/Saturday/Sunday they had a very large seafood buffet complete with hot/cold crab/lobster/shrimp/fish as well as sushi, dim sum as well as roast lamb and beef. The dessert selection was also quite nice with fresh fruit, cakes and cookies. It cost $38 per adult which is worth it if you鈥檙e a big seafood lover (like us) but if you don鈥檛 eat seafood it is not worth it to eat at this buffet.Also available Monday to Friday from 4pm-6pm is a happy hour snack in the lobby. A different hot hors d鈥檕eurve was served each afternoon as well as a selection of cheeses, spreads and breads. Drinks were available for a nominal fee.Value:We paid $159USD per night which is a fantastic price for the quality and service we received at this hotel. This was for a standard guest room. The suites with whirlpools and the rooms on the executive floor were in the $200USD+ category.Overall:This hotel is an excellent choice for anyone who is going to be touring the Hollywood/Universal area that doesn鈥檛 have a car. Tours information is available from the concierge and there is a free shuttle that runs every 15 minutes between the Sheraton, the Hilton and Universal Studios.Location: 10/10Amenities: 9/10Guestroom: 8/10Dining: 8/10Service: 9/10Value: 9/10","Aug 24, 2005","21","20",5,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$233"

The beds were super comfortable. The bathroom was quite large. The pool was great but not good for little ones. It gets deep very fast, our youngest happily hung out on the very long steps. We were on the 18th floor but never had to wait more than two minutes for an elevator. We only stayed here because of the proximity to Universal.

Exasperated, I called the bellman to report the problem He said he would take care of it and call me back in ten minutes to make sure the problem was handled You can guess where this is going--nobody ever handled the problem and he never called back I sat on the phone another half hour until the operator answered, and she wanted to put me on hold! I told her absolutely not, explained the problems, and asked to speak to a manager I was given the voice mail of the manager, who spoke very poor English (There is no manager on duty? Or an assistant? Why is there no extension for housekeeping?) I clearly stated the problems and gave my email address, telling the voice mail that I expected to be contacted It has been about a week and the hotel has never bothered to contact meThere is no concierge at this hotelAdditionally, do not waste your money eating in this hotel if you stay here The food is poor and way overpriced T here is a very nice Ralph's grocery store right around the corner which has a delicious deli and bakery You can buy food and take it outIt seems that the Hilton chain is slightly tarnished and is certainly not what it once was The staff at the Hilton Universal leaves a lot to be desired and certainly could benefit from some customer service training They also need more staff members Apparently, Marriott, generally spekaing, is the superior of the big three better hotel chains","Aug 7, 2005","17","13",3,3,1,4,1,2,1,"4","$233"

They gave me a smoking room saying that was all they had -- and then gave me a non-smoking when I balked. There was an overall crappy attitude by the front desk -- something I would expect from a Motel 6 in Compton. I stayed at the Beverly Hilton a few weeks ago and it was 180 degrees opposite.

It is better to be a Hilton Honors Member as they have a shorter check in line.The staff here is great and always waiting to assist you, but you will be handing out tips like candy.The room was average size, high quality beds, sheets, towels. The room has 3 phones and nice furniture, and a room safe. They have HBO, and most kids channels. They have a nice shuttle every 30 minutes to Universal Studios. This saves you parking fees at the studio, but you do pay to park at the Hilton. $10 to $16 a day to park in fact.The resteraunt and room service are very expensive though, typical for a Hilton. There is a also a Sheraton that is next to Universal Studios, but that Hotel is moslty for families and is very noisy and crowded. The Hilton is a cut above. We had our kids there with us and they were treated well by the staff.Some jerk put a meal to our room number while he ate in the resteraunt, but the hotel took it off of our bill when I caught it.

I had reserved a 1 king bed room and was given 2 double beds which I was very disappointed with. Called the front desk but they couldn't help me and I did not want to wait around trying to switch rooms later.The room itself seemed larger than normal, it seemed to be stretched out long. It also had a great view, I could see the front of Universal Studios from our window. Which is great at night because the lights from the city walk looked nice. Did try out the room service, great food and it came up fairly fast.Check out was super easy, they slipped a bill under our door sometime while we were sleeping, if the bill looked fine we just leave and that amount would get charged to us.

I looked here and saw that the reviews of the Sheraton were not so great so I chose the Hilton based on its reviews. I was happy I did. It is not cheap nor is it a spectacular hotel for the price. We usually stay at much fancier hotels. The room was very clean and a good size with a small table and chairs and a seperate desk where my husband set up his laptop to connect to the internet. There was a fruit basket in the room with fresh fruit, water and cookies upon our arrival.It was a quick 5 minute walk to City Walk and Universal. Hotel self-parking was very convenient. The valet staff was great as the held my car by the entrance if I was running back out. Concierge helped with some practical issues and front desk staff was pleasant, but we did not have any special requests from them. The hotel is convenient to the highway - right in front actually. The Brunch on Sunday was very good with lots of variety. Pool area was quiet and pleasant. Overall, I don't think you could go wrong here.","Mar 11, 2005","6","6",4,5,1,5,1,5,1,"4","$233"

When we arrived there was a long line at the front desk due to a large group arrival whose rooms would not be ready until later. At first I thought we will never check in!! Than, I saw a sign for Hilton Honors and checked right in. By the way the front desk moved everyone along and were very cheerful despite the crowd. We stayed on the Club floor and felt it was well worth the extra expense. It was very quiet on this floor and the lounge was a nice place to take a break. The service in the lounge was excellent. We had our new grandson visit and they were very kind to him. The room was clean and very comfortable. I normally stay at a Ritz or other 5 stars and stayed at the Hilton due to the location close to children. We were delighted we stayed there and will again.

"hotel_130","hotel_1676","Great location and pretty quiet considering the number of kids staying here We enjoyed our two night stay in this hotel in July, 2004. We chose this location for its proximity to Universal. Had no problem walking to Universal, once we figured out the safest way to get there to avoid the very crowded streets. Was pleasantly surprised that we didn't hear kids running up and down the halls or doors slamming since there were obviously a lot of children in residence. We stayed on the executive floor which included continental breakfast. This was great as we were traveling with a child. The dining room was not nearly large enough for all the guests, but the staff was great about refilling food. So if you time it right, or are patient, or give those reading a newspaper with their third cup of coffee enough dirty looks you can enjoy a great continental breakfast.","Dec 14, 2004","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$233"

"hotel_130","hotel_6986","Good Value Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. Not the best quality Hilton I have been in, but in a good location to Hollywood and LA. Had problems with the TV in the room. Called a technician twice, and was told to pull out the cord and plug it back in every time we wanted to watch TV. No mean feat when the plug was located behind a large cabinet, plus quite annoying for a 6 night stay.Hotel is located midway up a large hill. The Metro station is at the bottom of the hill and Universal Studios at the top. It is possible to walk down to the metro, but I wouldn't recommend walking up to anyone who isn't seriously fit. There are two shuttles that can be taken (one to universal from hotel, the other to the station from universal) which is a bit time consuming if you are in a hurry.Staff could have been more helpful (especially the tour desk) but the restaurant staff were exceptional. Highly recommend the dinner buffet. Never experienced one like it - It even beat the Vegas buffets.

We had an enormous room with panoramic views of Universal, and a large bathroom, both of which were very clean and modern. The staff were very helpful. The hotel seemed to be used equally by people on holiday, and on business, and this was reflected in the price of the restaurant, but there are many places to eat in Univeral City Walk.The biggest plus point for us was the Universal Studios Package on offer, which included the cost of two tickets to Universal Studios and the room rate. This deal saved us 40 dollars off the cost of 2 tickets bought at the Universal ticket office, and those tickets would have been for one day, whereas ours from the hotel were for 2 days. Definitely worth buying. We had a great time here.","Aug 9, 2004","4","4",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$233"

Check-in was fine. We got to our room and could definitely smell cigarette smoke. It's a Non-smoking hotel...The bedspread had several cigarette burns in it, too. The room was very, very worn and shabby. The bathroom had hair in the tub and sink. I called the front desk and told them and asked to have another room. She said I would need to come down and she would see what she could do. She did get me another room , but the only one was a deluxe room. She didn't charge me for the upgrade. She was very sorry for the problems with the room and would contact security about the smoking.The new room didn't smell like smoke, but did smell. It was a very large, corner room, hence deluxe. The bed was very hard and we could feel the springs. The sheets had holes in them. The room was cleaner, though, so we stayed there. We could not get our money back. Right on the motor way so very noisy.The restaurant was closed, but they would shuttle us to their sister hotel down the street, The Ohana. We decided to drive to a nearby mall and eat at the Ruby Tuesday.One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because the car rental return was within walking distance and it needed to be back early the next morning. We returned it after dinner, though, and that was a wise move.We decided that we should have stayed in a hotel farther away and just left really early!

We, however, had to ring for a shuttle bus from the airport to take us there instead of walking. It is located on the highway, with very little restaurants, convenient stores- even fast food- close to it. I felt unsafe in this location. The room was smelly, and needed a refurbishment. Wallpaper coming off walls, mould in the fridge, and cardboard beds. The TV selection was exemplary though. The bathroom was to be expected of a hotel of this caliber. The hallways are dark and dingy, and the lobby too small. The free internet connection was enjoyable though.I do not recommend eating at the restaurant. The Seafood Buffet made us feel ill with badly prepared, very basic food. For $25 each, we were allowed the pleasure of sick stomachs during the night.

The room we stayed in was directly next to a highway where three roads converged and the traffic was so loud that it was impossible to sleep. Now I will admit that I am a light sleeper, but my home is located next to a highway and in the flight path of the Columbus Airport, so I hear planes fly overhead day and night. That was nothing compared to the noise of the traffic. I could not hear the television turned up on the highest volume. As for the cleanliness of the room, stay here if you want to see cockroaches in the shower. We found a few in the bathroom, along with mites all over the room. The next night when our flight was cancelled yet again (gotta love US Airways), we demanded to be put up in a nicer hotel. We got to stay at the Marriott down on Waikiki, which I would recommend in a heartbeat. Consider this a warning: due not stay at The Best Western Plaza hotel. Oh, and another warning.

I decided on the Best Western since I'm familiar with the chain and it was so close to the airport. Big mistake. My first issue was the location. It is located in a questionable area. Being a young woman traveling alone, safety is a major concern of mine. I felt like I was going to get robbed at any moment just walking from the curb to the front door.My second issue was with the room itself. Once I got there, I couldn't believe that I had paid $125. It wasn't worth half that. I stopped counting at the third hair I found in the bathroom. There were popcorn kernels on the nightstand. The lamp by the nightstand was burnt out. There were strange burn marks all over the carpet. The mini-fridge, although a nice ammenity in concept, was so grimy and moldy on the inside that I definitely wouldn't have used it. Weary from the trip from Columbus, Ohio, I stayed there that night against my better judgement. I promptly checked out the next morning. I spent the remainder of my trip at a hotel on Waikiki Beach for just $7 more per night. Very safe, clean and in a great location. Highly worth it.","May 4, 2007","2","2",2,2,2,2,4,4,3,"2.5","$199"

The hotel they chose for us was this Best Western. Being familiar with the chain this seemed to be a reasonable choice and we were after all just spending the night and then moving on the following day.The location of the building is nearly UNDER the freeway overpass and very close to the airport so you are bombarded by noise from both places. In our first room the airconditioner was not working and there were fresh blood stains on the bedspread. Now I'm not at all a fussy traveller but I draw the line at freshly spilled blood on the bed linens. I called the front desk and asked if we could be moved to another room and was offered a courtyard suite. This room was on the ground level and somewhat less noisy. My friend opened the door of the room to let in some air. When I stuck my head outside I noticed a couple of very unsavoury characters hanging out in the back alley which bordered the hotel. I then locked and bolted the door and went to sleep thinking we had a 50/50 chance of being robbed before morning.Free shuttle to airport was good and on time, and the full breakfast very good.

The lunch was buffet. They have a decent looking pool, although we did not use it. The room was quiet and we had no complaints. We like staying near the airport rather than making the trek into Waikik for one or two nights.","Nov 1, 2006","10","10",1,4,6,4,6,5,4,"2.5","$199"

"hotel_131","hotel_3225","A real ripoff. Very bad value. Room was dirty. Hair in the bathtub and on the sink countertop. The bathmat had been left to rot in the bottom of the tub and was stained badly.Room was poorly maintained. Cracked plaster and paint in the main room with peeling wallpaper. The lamp between the beds had two light sockets with one socket broken apart with wires showing. Mismatched tile repair in the shower, badly cracked ceiling in the bathroom with peeling paint. Bed was lumpy and you could feel the springs underneath the thin layer of padding over them.For a $60/night, I might have tolerated some of these problems, but not at the $150/night that I was charged.Restaurant was even a worse experience. On Sunday, only offered a buffet. Entree choices were beef in heavy gravy and grease soaked fried chicken with lots of untrimmed fat. By the time my wife got to the hot table, there was only fried chicken left. Salad bar had a large bowl of lettuce with lots of old wilted lettuce left in the bowl. At $21/person, this buffet did not even include any drinks; soft drinks or otherwise. As we checked out of the hotel, we saw an advertising panel for a complete seafood buffet for $18.95/person. Made me see red I was so angry. Got no sympathy from the waiter either.I will never ever return to this hotel again under any circumstance and will recommend others avoid this same experience.Stay here ONLY if you absolutely MUST stay near the Honolulu airport.

Upon return from our week away our car was damaged by someone evidently backing into it. The spaces are very small and distance between rows is adequate for careful drivers, but evidently not the one who hit us and then failed to notify. I went to the desk and advised Raj who was working the desk. He said he would write a report and have it ready to send to the company in the morning. There was another person on the desk in the A.M. and he said he didn't know of any report being written.I would advise against leaving a vehicle there if you want it in the same condition you left it in. The rooms are OK but the clientele is a little dicey. I would say the rooms were clean but the building is clearly showing its age. The desk is not unfriendly, but all the gentlemen that I met did not have a particular good fluency in English.I would certainly check out other hotels near the airport before staying there again.","Jun 1, 2006","12","10",4,4,1,4,1,3,1,"2.5","$199"

Unless it's changed radically....On the downside, don't arrive here late, as there's no after-hours restaurant. And the place isn't the cleanest in the world. The pool wasn't clean.On the plus side: there's a cheap takeout fast food place next door, there's a 7 ELEVEN type store near-by and there's an independent bar next door (Beware though, it's a bit tough).You can walk to the airport terminals in 5-10 minutes.It's passable for an overnight but don't plan a vacation here.

"hotel_131","hotel_4373","Roadside Redeye I booked this hotel because it is close to the airport and it was to be a nice place to rest for an overnight stay. Was I wrong! The dominant feature of this facility was the inescapable noise from the highway. The hotel is directly under the overpass of the major highway and the traffic never stops. It appears to be a once-nice accommodation, with a pool and a restaurant. The restaurant closes early in the evening, leaving the later arrivals to wander a questionable neighborhood in search of food. The breakfast there is good. The staff is friendly. The beds are adequate. Carpets are stained and dirty. Cleanliness of rooms is below average. There is a shuttle service to and from the airport. The service to the airport is fine. Not so the arrival: We sat for at least half an hour awaiting the shuttle from the airport, watching other shuttles from area hotels come and go. That was another unwelcome frustration. If you are looking for a restful night, this is not the place for you. I will never return. The inconvenience of traveling further from the airport to rest my weary body is minor when compared to the overwhelming discomfort of the roadside redeye experienced at this hotel.

The only good things I have to say about this hotel is the free shuttle from the airport and the fact that it is only 5 minutes away. The staff seemed to be very helpful.The worst part is its location right next to the interstate. The noise is very disturbing. The overall condition of the property was also poor. The rooms definitely need updating. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the bathroom was dingy and many tiles were broken. The beds were pretty bad too.

"hotel_133","hotel_2086","Great value! The Stratford is an older hotel that has recently been renovated. So, the rooms are quite small and the elevator is slow. Other than that, though, it's a great deal -- it's very clean, the decor is recent and tasteful in an IKEA kind of way, and the location can't be beat for tourism. I stayed in room 704, which had a great view down Powell St.; though the noise from the street might be pretty bad on the lower floors, it was barely audible on that level. Breakfast was a little stingy, but I'm fine with coffee and granola, so it did what I needed it to do.

The location of this hotel might suit some people who want to be in the centre of the city (its on a nosy main street around the corner from Union Square) but we found the noise at night really annoying and it kept us awake. We stayed on the eight floor and our room was tiny! The beds felt smaller than single beds and were not comfortable at all. The room was absolutely freezing and when we phoned the fromt desk to ask how to get the radiator to work we were told that it is on a main timer at the hotel and they could not turn it on for us! The radiator never worked at all for the course of our trip and we were absolutely frozen!

"hotel_133","hotel_7130","Stay Near The Square - In The Middle Of It All If you are contemplating a trip to see the Golden Gate and also seek basic accommodations with reasonable rates and a great Union Square location, then you need not search any further than the Stratford on the Square 鈥?though, not actually ON the square, it is a half block from it. However, the Stratford is in the middle of everything else: shops, Starbucks and eateries 鈥?oh, yes 鈥?the Powell Street Cable Car literally clangs right past the front door.Another bonus is its easy access to San Francisco鈥檚 wonderful Muni public transportation network (streetcars, underground trolley and bus) system as well as the area BART system, all of it operating from the Powell/Market Street station. The hotel is situated on the eastern side of Powell Street and a two-block uphill walk from the aforementioned station. There is a large sign with vertical lettering of the hotel name above the front entrance. The narrow lobby is non-descript; it consists of a small counter opposite a comfortable-looking sofa. On your left as you stand at the counter is the cramped and slooooow elevator 鈥?I found myself using the adjacent staircase more often than not. In the rear, behind the elevator is a lounge area with television and the requisite computer (for those weak souls unable to breathe without 24/7 internet access.) The Tea Room, where guests have their fill of a light complementary breakfast (bread, muffins, cereal, coffee and juice) can be found on the second floor. Actually, I though it to be a pleasant well-lit room. As you drink your coffee feel free to look down onto busy Powell Street and watch the cable car shuttle tourists up the steep incline towards the oh-so tacky Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf. If you are the type who needs a hearty breakfast to get you going, I don鈥檛 recommend it. (Instead, cross the street and head west a few blocks down Geary to the wonderful Olympic Flame diner, where hungry patrons can choose among 75 types of omelets.)The room, or at least mine, was all I needed for a week. The bathroom with toilet and closet-sized shower are separated by a sliding door; the sink was actually in the room opposite the bed. I won鈥檛 call it small; how about, I just call it comfortable? In any case, who goes to San Francisco to sit in a hotel room? Not I.If you seek glitz, marble, valet parking and a nightly mint, then seek elsewhere; otherwise, the Stratford Near the Square is an enjoyable and wholeheartedly recommended place to rest your head.","Nov 20, 2008","1","1",5,4,6,4,6,5,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_1957","Looking forward to next time! I booked a room with a Queen bed and was assigned a 6th floor location upon check-in. It was away from busy Powell Street, much to my relief, and a few steps away from the hotel elevator  stairs - the latter, which I used a lot except when I had my luggage to lug. For this, I used the elevator.The room required a magnetic card for entry. I left it in my room one day so the front desk staff gave me a new one after I provided my ID. They deactivated my original room card, which I subsequently returned to them. I didn't have a room view, which was fine. The white painted wall outside my window actually provided for some privacy. There was light at that side of the building so my room at night wasn't completely dark especially with my curtains slightly drawn.There was no air conditioner but my room had a ceiling fan with light. I turned it (fan) on or off depending on my comfort level. There were two corner lampshade lights attached to the headboard which gave me plenty of light as needed.There was a small cabinet at the corner foot of the bed with hangers, an iron, a small ironing board, and extra blanket stowed at the bottom drawer. On top of the cabinet was the television. Although it had HBO, I mostly turned it on for news and sports.Against the wall was a table and chair. The drawers were useful to put in some of my things as well as the desktop space. There were bottled drinks available but I didn't open any ($4-$5 each if you tamper the seal). I bought bottled water from nearby Walgreens across the street and got ice from the ice machine in the lobby.My bed was nice and comfortable ,which was the centerpiece of the room. The room was small relative to the other SF boutique hotels with queen bed reservation that I've tried before and didn't have any microwave and refrigerator. However, what the room had was adequate for my needs and provided for some degree of coziness and comfort. It was clean and well-kept when I first arrived and whenever I returned at the end of the day.The bathroom had a sink, shower stall, and fresh towels supplied daily. It had a built-in hair dryer as well. There was a small plastic bucket to put in some of your toiletries, which was supplied by travel-size Rusk products (body wash, shampoo, lotion).The tea room (2nd floor) had plenty of sunshine and windows overlooking Powell Street. For breakfast, it had sliced bread, muffins, granola, milk, juice, coffee, hot water, and selection of tea bags. It opened at 7:30 am. During those times when I was up and needed breakfast earlier, I went outside - plenty of breakfast options.There was a lounge area behind the elevators in the lobby. There was the TV, computers with printer, and a rack with a variety of attraction/tourist brochures. I didn't need to use the computer and read that for those who needed to, it required a credit card and charged $5 for 20 min. of usage (I don't remember the extra charge after that time limit) and printing cost $0.25 per page. Note: A one-way cable car fare is $5 without a MUNI passport so where would you rather spend it? :-)Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay at this hotel. It was nice to have 24-hr desk service and its location was ideal for me (access to BART, cable cars, bus lines, Union Square and surrounding areas). Check-in and check-out were convenient and the cost was reasonable. I booked my reservation online and didn't encounter any problems. I will definitely stay in this hotel again in the future. :-)","Nov 9, 2008","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_8965","Loud Street Noise, No AC We were looking for a hotel in the Union Square area that we could easily reach by BART as we were flying out from the international terminal the next day. This hotel is very close to a BART station. After having had a bad experience at the Palace (very loud street noise, couldn't sleep), I looked for a Union Square hotel review that did not mention street noise. However, the street noise at the Stratford did turn out to be very loud. There was a band playing across the street until 11PM or so. There was no AC in the room and it does sometimes get hot in SF. So you have to open the window to cool down. The windows only open about 4 inches so it is very tough to cool down. The room was very small, but that is to be expected in SF. It was a remodel of a very old building and the age showed through in some places. There was a flat screen TV to make it look more modern, but it was a tiny one. Because of the low price, I did not feel as bad as I did after staying at the Palace. But I'd only recommend this hotel for night owls for nights when cold weather is predicted, or for college kids planning to stay out late, get drunk then pass out. If I stay in that area again, I'd probably stay at the Hilton two blocks away. I avoided that hotel because it was closer to the Tenderloin but there isn't much difference in two blocks, and there are panhandlers between the BART station and this hotel anyway.","Oct 26, 2008","0","0",5,3,5,4,5,4,4,"4","$148"

Slept well despite this.Bathroom spacious and clean. Had a big window which let in lots of light, shower over bath was right next to the large frosted window, bit strange, but on a high floor so wasn't too worried.Breakfast included which was convenient , nothing amazing, but definitely enough to keep you going until lunch.Location - don't think you could get more central.

"hotel_133","hotel_3756","All I needed The other reviews have it right. The rooms are small and most have only one bed. Make sure you book a family suite if traveling with more than one other CLOSE friend. Most rooms have only a shower, no bathtub, which is fine with me, because I only take showers. My room was immaculate, and stayed that way throughout my stay. Furnishings are simple but the bed was comfortable and everything was in good condition. Only had one trouble - there was a circuit breaker for the bathroom and light over the sink that tended to trip. The front desk clerk told me how to reset it.Desk staff was friendly and helpful and checking in and out was fast and easy. There is an included continental breakfast in a nice tea room on the second floor, but it is minimal. There is bread and toasters, granola and yogurt. There is a nice selection of muffins. They have coffee, tea, milk and two types of fruit juice. I wish they had had fresh fruit. The room filled up fast when they opened at 7:30, but there was more seating by the time I left at a little after 8. If you want an American style breakfast, several restaurants in the area have it.Location was great, two blocks from the Powell St. transit stations, which meant that I got there from SFO on BART in less than 45 minutes for only $5.35.

We were not disappointed on either. The hotel is just up the street a few minutes walk from the start of the cable car route to Fishermans Wharf and Union Square is about half a minute walk around the corner. We got BART from the airport ($5.35pp) and walked up Powell Street to the hotel. The young man at reception was most helpful and showed us on maps where the hotel was and pointed out areas to visit. He also said that if we wanted to know anything to come back and ask.The room we had was small as we expected but very clean with a reasonably comfortable bed, a sink in the room and a separate small room with shower and toilet. There was a hairdryer beside the sink and an iron/ironing board in the small wardrobe. Towels were replaced daily. After hiking around all day we didn't notice any noise at night!Continental breakfast was included in the room rate which is unusual for US. This was orange or cranberry juice, yogurt, cereal, toast, muffins and hot drinks and was adequate to keep us going until lunchtime.There were plenty of places to eat around the hotel - we had great Thai food just around the corner in Muang Thai and enjoyed Lori's Diner too. We also had dinner in Jazz Bistro Les Joulins which was lovely and very reasonable with the added extra of live music.The shopping around this area was great too - every type of shop from Gucci and Louis Vuitton to Ross and Marshalls!We would stay here again due to cleanliness, value for money and location, but don't go if you want 5 star luxury and plan to spend lots of time in your room.","Sep 12, 2008","2","2",5,4,5,5,5,5,1,"4","$148"

Perfect for any tourist wanting to be close to all the action and be able to get around town easily. We were able to catch the BART (subway) straight from SFO to Powell station and walk easily with our suitcases to the hotel. In addition, the cable car turnaround on literally 100m away - so it was easily to get to all those tourist attractions (i.e. Fishermans Wharf, Lombard st etc)Although we were initially surprised by the tiny room...we soon made ourselves comfortable. As mentioned by other reviewes..there isnt much floor space for your suitcases however the bedroom and beds were clean - which is important when you just want a place to sleep in at the end of an exhausting day.The complimentary breakfast was a plus. Definitely saved times in the morning wondering around deciding where to eat (and whether anything had opened yet). Although it was quite simple...it was enough to get your day started with toast, muffins, coffee and juice.The only hotel improvements I would recommend are:1) Improve the lift service (it was excruciatingly slow)2) Install air conditioners in the rooms (although our room was quite cool and we never thought twice about needing it)3) Have the sink inside the bathroom as opposed to next to the bed4) Consider having a clearer shower curtain so that you can have some light whilst showering (there were no windows in our bathroom and the only light was in the center of the room)All in all...happy with our stay!","Sep 5, 2008","1","1",4,4,6,6,6,5,4,"4","$148"

That was the reason for my trip I wanted to do all my X-mas shopping in the city. I think this will become a yearly tradition.I had a room with 2 twin beds so my bf and I just pushed them together to make a semi-full sized bed. There was a little vanity area and closet sufficient for all my shopping bags. It really would not be condusive for more than 2 adults though. Check-in and out was a breeze and they do have computers in the lobby that you can rent if you need to check emails. We parked in one of the many garages in the area, they may have valet but everything is so close you really wouldn't need your car till you leave so a garage will do just fine.","Jul 16, 2008","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$148"

The cable car stops right outside the door, there is a great deli just across the street and union square is just around the corner.The hotel itself is just what you need when you are on a break in a city like San Francisco. It is a budget hotel but the rooms are clean and perfectly roomy, breakfast is included in your rate and the front desk is available 24/7. If you want 5 star luxury in a city like San Francisco then you must be planning to spend a lot of time in your room.We were looking for a pleasant hotel to use as a base for our family holiday and thats exactly what we got.We would recommend the hotel to anyone wanting the same and as for the noise of the cable cars, they stop at midnight. And if you want to get some sleep any earlier earplugs are provided. My two teenagers slept in the street facing bedroom and had no problems with noise and they thought the earplugs were just another wacky american notion (thats irish teenagers for you.)","Jul 1, 2008","2","2",6,4,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$148"

From a few floors up you can have a great view of the street coming to life in the morning. After you've had your fill you can take a nice cup of coffee along with you out onto the street and walk just a few yards away right into Union Square, where there is always something going on.

On the first night I was placed near the street where one can hear the constant noise of the trolley car and rambunctious street band. I was then moved to the back of the hotel into a room that smelled like fresh paint. It was nauseating. In addition to the smell the room was freezing. I asked the front desk about the heat situation and they kept telling me it took awhile to heat up. But it never heated up. Usually I feel like I am a flexible person or easy going where it comes to where I sleep but this was not enjoyable. I recommend this for people who will really only use the room for sleeping. I guess in this situation you get what you pay for.","May 29, 2008","0","0",3,3,6,3,4,5,1,"4","$148"

"hotel_133","hotel_6085","Sufficient and convenient There were three of us in a queen/club queen room for one night last week. My bed was farily comfortable, but seemed a bit narrower than my queen at home. For us three adults, it was a wee bit crowded, but then again, we didn't go to SF to stay in the room. Though very basic, the hotel/room was clean, updated and more than sufficient for a brief stay. The breakfast, which was included, was very basic: mini-muffins, white bread, granola, coffee, milk, tea, and juice. I didn't care for the very slow single lift, which seemed to always re-open the doors at least once after you've already selected your floor or pressed close doors. With our room being on the seventh floor, I definitely got my exercise on the stairs! The location was, to me, the hotel's best feature. Powell St was close to everything (except the water), and the cable cars passed right in front of the hotel, though you had to walk a wee bit to the stop (no problem there). The staff was pleasant and helpful, and we could store our baggage in the backroom for free before we checked in and after we checked out. One more thing-there is absolutely NO AC/central air of any kind, so opening windows was the only way to go because it was absolutely stifling in our room. The bathroom window opened downwards, and even with our room being located on a high floor and with the shower curtain closed, it was still a bit weird to have such an open view into an extremely private room! Powell St was extremely busy and noisy until about 22h, esp with the windows open, but none of us had any trouble falling asleep, probably b/c we were so exhausted from our day's activities. Overall, a pleasant stay at the Stratford.","Apr 30, 2008","2","2",3,5,6,6,5,5,1,"4","$148"

The room was a bit small but clean and well equipped. Nice shower, a surprising 32鈥?LCD TV, and wireless internet ($30/month or $10/day).Breakfast was ok to get my day going with juice, coffee, bread and muffins. Within a short walking distance you will find lots of restaurants and dinners.Staff was nice and courteous. There was no problem with noise, as I stayed in a room that鈥檚 away from the street.

There's no denying that the rooms are small, but that's what you're going to get in a smaller, lower-priced hotel in any city. The room was fine for us, though, and the bed was comfortable. The staff was always friendly and helpful, and we had no problem storing our luggage prior to check-in. The continental breakfast was fine, too, but don't expect an extravagant meal.

Plus, if you fly into SF or Oakland airport, you can take the BART to the Powell St station, which is only 2 blocks away for only about $7 round trip and save the money on valeting your car. Staff was very courteous. If you are in town just to shop and party, this is the place for you. If you have kids, you may want to reconsider. Breakfast is a little lacking if you are a morning food person. But, there's a Walgreens a block away and you can buy food there to supplement the bread, muffins, granola, and yogurt.

"hotel_133","hotel_8567","Very Pleasantly Surprised with Feb 22-24 2008 Stay I needed a moderately priced hotel to stay at while traveling on business and decided to try this one. After reading the reviews (yes, the room was really that small), I was prepared for an average stay. Instead, I was VERY pleasantly surprised. The front desk staff was gracious when I arrived late and was able to accomodate my request for a roll-a-way bed without a problem - and they didn't charge me for it. And while the room had no real view to speak of, it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room was neither too hot (there is a radiator wtih an automatic turn-on valve) or too cold (ceiling fan), and while the cable cars make noise, the noise is not that bad (unless you are staying on the streetfront part of the hotel). The continental breakfast was good for those who are not big breakfast eaters, and there is a Starbuck's across the street from the hotel if you need Starbucks. The hotel is within easy walking distance to Union Square as well as Market Street and the transportation kiosk where you can purchase a 3-day cable car/street car/muni bus pass for $18 - this is a great value as you can take the cable and street cars just about anywhere you want to go. There are a number of very interesting restaurants, shops and jazz clubs in the area, again all within a pleasant walking distance. All in all, my colleague and I were very pleased and enjoyed our stay. I will most definately return again with my husband and child for a weekend stay! And I will make sure to return for the Chinese New Year's parade, as the hotel is 50 paces away from where the parade passes by.","Feb 25, 2008","1","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,5,"4","$148"

"hotel_133","hotel_5371","Fair Value The Stratford is a 2 star hotel of fair value. The price we paid through Expedia was approximately $100.00 per night.LOCATION: Absolutely SUPERB!! 1/2 block from Union Square, 1 Block from Market Steet, the cable car runs right in front of the hotel, major department stores within 1 block, Walgreen's 1/2 block, very short walk to Chinatown and the financial district. For the walkaholics, Fisherman's wharf would be an easy stroll.LOBBY: somewhat dark and drab. They need to have stronger lights and brighter paint and carpet color. The lobby is small, but there is an attached room which has a TV and 2 computers with (very expensive) access to the internet.INTERNET ACCESS: $10/hour through the hotel, or $30/month through a wireless service. However, if you walk up to UNION SQUARE with your laptop, there is free wireless. I was there as early as 7:30 AM (brrrrrrr) and as late as 10:00PM. Relatively safe, they have security 24/7, but it's good to be alert and cautious. Connection was excellent.LOBBY STAFF: Very Friendly and helpful. Absolutely no complaints.ROOM: our room was small, but quiet. We were in the back of the hotel, so did not get any noise from the street. It was also clean, but the carpet showed its age. The bathroom was also small. Closet space was limited but adequate. The room would not be particularly comfortable for oversized people. The cleaning staff was efficient and friendly. BREAKFAST: Continental breakfast is served from 7:30 - 9:30. Simple, but adequate. Muffins, toast, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, juice, yogurt, milk, coffee. No fresh fruit.TRANSPORTATION: Cable car is efficient and fun. The bus routes are excellent and timely. We took the bus from market street to the de young museum and it worked out quite well. There is of course walking, which we did to the Asian Art Museum. BART is cheap and efficient - if you don't have a big load. We paid $5.15 one way from SFO to the Powell street exit. Finally, there seemed to be adequate taxi service. SUMMARY: If you're looking for a less expensive hotel, the stratford is worth considering.","Dec 18, 2007","1","1",5,4,6,5,4,6,2,"4","$148"

While the heating is on, the room is fine, but *they switch the heating off* at about 8.30pm every evening! So it got very cold after that. I don't know when the heating comes on again but it certainly wasn't before 9.30am when I left the hotel each morning.Breakfast is included in the price and was OK: muffins, pastries, toast, cereal and the like; but not much choice and it was exactly the same every day, so you may get bored of it quite quickly.","Nov 19, 2007","1","0",3,3,6,5,4,1,1,"4","$148"

As you open your door you almost hit the end of the bed, but at the same time, it had everything we needed... although the only place to sit is on your bed. One thing I found a real problem was the fact that there is one small window and if you leave it open at night it is noisy. We had to sleep with the window closed which made the room really hot to sleep in as there is no air-conditioning or fan. The front desk gave us the wrong room type but we had no troubles getting a different room when we went and told them.The hotel is in a fantastic location, souvenirs, groceries, clothes... everything you could need is all located within a 5 minute walk of the hotel including the big Westfield shopping centre.My friend and I only stayed at the hotel for 2 nights so it was tolerable, but I'm glad we weren't staying there for too much longer as the room really was small and there was no ventilation. I think part of the reason I was so unimpressed was simply because I had stayed in fabulous hotels in LA and Vegas for the 2 weeks before our stay at the Stratford and we had become used to the standard.For anyone who is on a budget or staying for a short time I would say try the Stratford simply for its amazing location, but if you are in town for longer, maybe fork out bit more money and find somewhere with more comfort (ie. air-con)","Sep 12, 2007","1","0",4,3,6,5,4,4,1,"4","$148"

The lift was slow but there are stairs if you are in a hurray. Staff were helpful and friendly. I loved being able to step out of the hotel and be right in the centre of town - shops, Union Square, cable car etc. I would definitely stay here again but possibly avoid a weekend as prices rise considerably.","Jul 20, 2007","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_8949","Very Happy Customer My wife and I arrived on the 4th of July in the afternoon and were greeted very warmly by the staff. As soon as we got to our room (we were very happy to have a view of the street) we took off to explore. We found that our hotel is located just half a block from Union Square and just 2 blocks from where the cable car turns around. So not only is The Stratford located very close to so many of the things we wanted to see but it is a wonderful hotel. The free morning breakfast is just the healthy food we needed to start our day. The room has a very nice bathroom and is very clean and well laid out. We were unable to do and see all the things we wanted to so when we come back to San Francisco we will without a doubt be staying at The Stratford and I will also be recommending this hotel to anybody I know making the same trip.","Jul 14, 2007","2","2",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_6200","Perfectly suitable for short break Having read some of the previous reviews of the Stratford I wasn't sure what to expect when we arrived.However, we were pleasantly suprised by what we found. On check in we met the friendliest security guy ever and had a chat with him before we went to our room.The rooms are not massive, but perfectly adequate for 2 people plus luggage. decor was fine, very clean, nice bathroom, good TV.Throughout a 2 week trip we made to the US, very few hotels we stayed in included breakfast so that's an added bonus at the Stratford. They have cereals, bread, muffins, tea, coffee and orange juice.Location is unbeatable-the hotel is steps away from Union Square, right on the tram line to get to Fishermans Wharf and has some good restaurants and bars in the surrounding streets so everything you need is in good walking distance.I would definately stay here again and would recommend to others.","Jul 2, 2007","2","2",5,5,6,5,5,4,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_8938","Loved It! 06/29/07 - I stayed at this hotel back in Feb. '05. It was the first time that I went to San Fran. The reason I booked at this hotel, was because of the price and location. I made a good choice. The rooms are little on the smaller side, but you are not going to San Fran to stay in your room. The rooms were very nice. A lot of shopping, restaurant, bars and a mall nearby. The staff was very kind and friendly and this is the reason I'm booking at this hotel when I go to San Fran in september. Thank You Stratford Hotel.","Jun 29, 2007","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$148"

Great place... read review just prior to this one and he says it all very well.... was there in April 2007 ... 2nd time in SF/Union square in past year.....TIP: This hotel is affordable enough to just book it outright.... NOT worth playing games on HOTWIRE to get a Union Square hotel for $30 less b/c it can very shady very quickly .... The Powell is another nice affordable choice w/slightly bigger rooms... but overall the location, nice breakfast and value of the STRATFORD i will def go back there next time in SF....","Jun 22, 2007","0","0",5,4,6,5,6,5,4,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_5119","Everything you need My girlfriend and I stayed at The Stratford for one night in May, a Thursday. Arriving into the Oakland airport late (11:30), we had no trouble finding the hotel and checking in. The staff was very helpful in directing us on where to 1) park, 2) get a late nite dinner, and 3) find a cool bar to have a nitecap. Parking was conveniently located a block away (Ofarrell  Mason) in a public garage  was predictably expensive ($26 for 18 hr). Once the car was parked we went to Cafe Mason, right near the parking garage. This was an excellent choice for a respectable  delicious late nite meal. Afterwards, on the way back to the hotel we stopped in Johnny Foley's Irish House just around the corner for a few drinks and to take in some San Fran nite life. Highlight of the night: the transvestite lounge singer who takes requests at the pub.The room was admittedly small, but was clean  had nice design to it. You could defineatly feel the vibe. Why do you need a big room, if your just going to sleep in it? The bathroom was clean and decorated sparingly with style. The elevator was slow at times, but it wasn't too much of a hassle to use the stairs as we were on the fourth floor. Breakfast was nice and light, granola, yogurt, muffins, tea, coffee,  juice. The breakfast room overlooks Powell St. and the hustle  bustle of the city. Hearing the cablecar go by every few minutes really made us anxious to get out and explore the city. Of note; as we were staying in the standard room, wi-fi was not included and was only available for a fee. Fortunately, there was a free hotspot at union square that could be accessed from the hotel (yes, that is how close it is to Union Square).The best thing about this place is the central location to EVERYTHING. BART, Muni Metro, the F Market Streetcar, cable cars,  buses run constantly within a short distance of the Stratford. Before checking out that morning we walked around the neighborhood. Two blocks down Powell is Market St., where the cable cars turn around and a convenient place to buy your Muni pass. Low and behold, what store was right next door? A three story Forever 21, alas my girlfriend was in heaven........also nearby is a giant Macy's fronting Union square and numerous art galleries. While there are quite a bit of panhandlers around, they are not aggressive and shouldn't be feared. They can even be of help to lost or confused tourists.All in all, The Stratford was done right. Cheap rates ($90 in high season), nice accommodations, polite  helpful staff, in an awesome neighborhood in the middle of everything. What more could you ask for? I will definitely stay at the Stratford next time I'm in San Fran.","Jun 15, 2007","1","1",6,5,6,6,6,6,3,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_4257","Great Location - Room adequate I booked one night on Orbitz  called to add another night. We paid $147 per night. The location is great - right in the middle of everything. The room iwas very, very small. We booked a King size room thru Orbitz. When we got to our room, it was a queen. When we went to the front desk, they said they didn't have king rooms. We paid $10 more for the king. We told the front desk but didn't even acknowledge it. I have since gone on the Orbitz site and they have removed the king room. The bed took up the whole room. The bathroom was very small but extremely clean. Our room was right next to the stairway and it just happened that there was some kind of run/walk going on the next day. The walls are paper thin and the runners were on the stairs at 5:00am. Our room looked out at a brick wall. No air but didn't need it. We learned real quick that San Francisco is not very warm, my husband ended up buying a winter jacket! There was a couple checking out the day after we checked in. They did not have a working toilet for the 2 days that they were there. There were no other rooms available and the hotel offered them $20 off a night. The couple said it was not acceptable but the girl at the desk did not back down. They left with an open credit card bill until the manager could get back to them. Would we stay again? Probably not - there are other hotels nearby.","Jun 12, 2007","0","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_4615","About as central as you can get The Stratford is a good but unprepossessing budget hotel right on Powell Street less than a block from Union Square. The basic rooms are small but clean and well furnished. I've stayed there twice, first in 311 a small room at the back of the hotel. It was small but very quiet and perfectly adequate. This time we had room 601, one of their deluxe Centennial Club Rooms. This was a much larger, better furnished room overlooking Powell... it was noisy at night, and again in the morning when recycled garbage was collected around 4am and then a little later when the cable cars started. We had no problem sleeping and the noise of the city gave it an atmosphere, but if you are a light sleeper don't get one in the front. The modest breakfast is included in the price and is fine, though it would be nice to have had fruit on offer. Free local newspapers also available at breakfast. The staff are really helpful and friendly. I'd stay there again.","May 31, 2007","1","1",5,4,5,4,5,1,1,"4","$148"

"hotel_133","hotel_5316","Great room, great rate, friendly staff! I loved staying at the Stratford. We had a nice little room, one of their standard queen bed rooms, towards the back of the property. We didn't have much of a view, but that didn't really matter to us. The room was small, I won't lie on that point, but we didn't go to San Francisco to spend the whole time in our room. The room was clean and the furnishings were nice. It looked like it had been recently remodeled, the paint was nice and clean looking. Our bed was very comfy and my husband and I slept like a dream, even though neither of us sleep well in hotel rooms. I love how close this place is to all the fun things to do on Market Street. We were right across the street from all sorts of restraunts on Powell and were just a short walk from the Westfield mall and all the shops around there. It was also very easy to get around to the other places in the city as well. We were close enough to walk all the way to Chinatown and back. The Stratford is right on the cable car line, and you can catch it right outside the hotel's door. It's also very close to the underground train and the bus line. It wasn't noisy at all, like other guests have mentioned, but, we were at the back of the property. We left both windows open all night both nights and didn't have a problem at all, and I'm an incredibly light sleeper. The elevator did seem to move a little slow sometimes, but it's an old building so I didn't expect it to go rocket fast! Plus, I wasn't really in any sort of a hurry. The staff was incredibly helpful when we asked about buying MUNI passes and places to eat and thrift shops to go to in the area! It was nice to have someone to valet park our car too, then we didn't have to worry about it for two days!","Apr 25, 2007","2","2",4,4,6,5,5,4,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_2181","charming I took my mom to SF and stayed 3 nights at the Stratford and found it perfectly acceptable. We didn't notice any smell in the lobby like others mentioned. The room was small but not to the extent that the door opens into the bed. We found it charming and decently clean. We requested a room facing the street because it would be boring to stay at the back. It was noisy the first night but we quickly got used to the city buzz and slept like babies for the following nights. We didn't find the elevator *that* slow but then we don't understand what was the hurry. Location-wise, it is definitely convenient. Cable car is only steps from the front door and a short walk from the Powell station.Breakfast consists of sliced bread, muffins, granola, yogurt, jam, juice, coffee and hot water. Far from ideal for a vegan like me. But it's a minor irritant. My mom who is a vegetarian, enjoyed the muffins and granola with yogurt.The interesting part was -- someone set off the fire alarm early in the morning one day (before day break) and the fire alarm sent us running up and down the stairs some 3 times before the issue was resolved. We were up anyway and found the unintended morning exercise amusing. But some elderly in wheelchair was stressed, trapped on the 6th floor without a working elevator. Not at all the hotel's fault. Just such things happen.","Apr 18, 2007","2","2",6,4,6,5,5,1,5,"4","$148"

The Club Room was nicely furnished, modern and had a large bathroom. It looked exactly like the photo on their website. My only complaint was the tolitries were never replenished. The complimentary breakfast was basic, but plentiful - yogurt, granola, pastry, juice, coffee. Overall, it was a fantastic deal for the location.

This hotel is more in the European style - the room is not where you will be spending most of your time, so why bother making it huge?Everything was clean enough that we were comfortable.

We loved the Stratford and will stay there again!When we arrived at the Stratford, we unloaded and parked the car and did not get back into the car until we checked out of the hotel! Everything we needed was at or around the hotel! We walked everywhere! We walked to ATT Park, Fisherman's Wharf, to the shops, bars, and restaurants. The room was very small, but nice. We loved the comfortable bed, earth tone decor, yellow walls, and roomy bathroom. The view from our room was fantastic! We saw the cable car, shops, and food venues. I was a little concerned about the noise from the street below, but the windows kept all the sound out. The second night we actually slept with one window open!The only downside is the slow elevator, but please remember this building is very old.

"hotel_133","hotel_8571","Excellent Hotel !! Located in Reno, a visit to San Francisco is just a few hours away. As I visit the city frequently, I have my favorite places to stay. Before making the trip I decided to surf the internet and see what hotel options were out there. If you have ever been to San Francisco, you will know that hotels are either affordable (and you wouldn't send your worst enemy their way) or extremely overpriced (and you wouldn't have enough money to enjoy any of the amazing things the city has to offer). Rarely does a hotel come along that has an excellent location, great amenities and affordable ~ until the Stratford. Upon arriving at the hotel I was quite suprised. You could not find a better location in Union Square. I was checked in right away and was quite pleased with the room. Although small (as every hotel room is in San Francisco) it was very clean and modern. There was in-room internet access, an I-Pod docking station and a stand up shower. The room had recently been remodeled and was much nicer than I ever expected. I was in room 701 and had an excellent view of Powell street. As this is one of the most lively areas in San Francisco, the nightlife was bustling right outside the window. It was great to open the windows and listen to the street musicians and the bells of the trolley's passing by. In the morning you can smell the fresh air of the city as the fog is rolling away and hear the laughter and relaxed conversaion of other visitors as they go about their visit to this amazing city. At the Stratford, you are within walking distance to premier shopping, China Town, the Muni (Underground subway system that will take you anywhere you want to go) and a huge variety of restaurants and entertainment. After my visit to the Stratford, this has become my hotel of choice. I will not stay anywhere else in the city ever again. If you are looking for a quiet out of the way restful vacation, this is not your place. If you want to feel the pulse of the city and be amongst it all, try the Stratford. Price, location  personality all make this a perfect hot spot. Previous posts mention the slow elevator. There is only one, and it is quite slow. The wait is not extreme, however, I found myself using the stairs during busy lobby times and was not inconvenienced in any way. To me, the small, slow elevator was just another piece of rustic charm this great boutique hotel has to offer!","Nov 21, 2006","4","4",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$148"

"hotel_133","hotel_7155","Great Value First let me say, I was traveling on a budget and alone! I found this hotel on hotels.com for approximately $100.00 per night. I checked other reviews here on TripAdvisor and decided to go for it. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very accomodating in finding me a room that was in a main hallway so that I would feel comfortable in the fact that I was a female traveling alone. The breakfast that was included was not gourmet, but certainly a luxury that we Americans do not see very often. The room was very clean. Yes, it was small and the comforter wasn't down filled, but you should expect that if you are paying $100.00 a night.The decor' of the lobby and the sitting area was nice. There were three computers and a printer available with a swipe of a card. I found this particularly convenient the day I was leaving. I was able to check-in online for my flight and print my boarding pass. Finally...I was right around the corner from Union Square and plenty of desireable restaurants. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that doesn't feel the need to spend $400.00 per night for a room.","Oct 19, 2006","6","6",5,4,5,5,5,5,5,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_4574","Not Impressed Although the location is great if you want to be by Union Square, and the rates may be competitive, I was not happy with my stay.

Was supposed to be at the Adante Hotel but they were booked and sent me to their sister hotel, the Stratford (thankfully! The Adante is not close at all to Union Square and is in much seedier part of the neighborhood). - I didn't find the staff that helpful or friendly; too busy to acknowledge me at the desk; had to wait to get my suitcase from the luggage storage; got attitude whan I asked them to hunt down the guy with the keys so I could catch my plane.- My TV did not work; the clock radio did not work; the sink (in the bedroom) leaked; no ironing board in the room; didn't allow early check-in or late check-out (I can live with this becasue they were booked up, but fit trend of being inflexible and not too concerned about customer service); elevator does take forever; no free WiFi (Tip: Union Square has free public WiFi); no A/C, which in San Fran is okay, but no ceiiling fan in the room). - On the good side, I thought the Tea Room was okay for continental breakfast, coffee etc.If you're going to stay there it better be for the location and the value.","Sep 29, 2006","0","0",3,4,6,4,3,4,3,"4","$148"

Whilst the room contained a double bed and a small desk there was barely enough room for one adult plus one suitcase let alone two adults and two suitcases. The bathroom was basic and functional.

You can not beat it's location especially if you are new to the area it is right on Powell street next to shops, transport links, restaurants etc. We had a room at the back of the hotel as well as on the end of a row. After reading past reviews of the hotel we weren't expecting much and we knew we hadn't paid a huge amount; however we were pleasantly surprise the room was plenty big enough and had a decent size bathroom. The sink was in the main room with a nice mirror and space to store your toiletries.  The breakfast was a nice touch and we filled ourselves up on toast, muffins, cereal etc. If you don't fancy this there are plenty of options for other food close by.  As I mentioned the location is excellent right by the shopping centre, Macy's and the lovely Union Square is a few strides away. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful; even making a phone calls to our tour providers to sort out some problems we were having. There is a small lounge on the ground floor at the back as well as two computers where for a small charge you can access the internet. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a first stop off in the city; it is a budget hotel so if your staying for more than a few days you may want some more luxury; but for what you pay you get a good service and stay.Tips: request a room at the back of the hotel. The smell you may experience as you enter the hotel is  only coming from Lush next door.

I woke up at 3 am in the morning and complained that the heater wasnt working. The person I talked to said the heater conked out. They told me we could not do anything about it. The breakfast option is simple...sometimes getting a donut across the street is better. The location is great as it is in Union Square, they have one computer below with free internet.

"hotel_133","hotel_4547","False Advertising My daughter and I stayed at The Stratford Hotel last week for two nights. While the location is wonderful and the staff polite, there were problems. Our room smelled strongly of chlorine when we arrived, and the carpet was moist and moldy. We had to have the window open all night, but still my daughter had asthma attacks both nights. The lights went out in the bathroom and over the sink (circuit breaker?) twice. The bottled waters for sale for $4. were insulting. We went out the second morning, returning at 10:30 to collect our luggage and check out. Our door wouldn't open. When we asked we were told that our keys must have been de-magnetized. Very annoying to be locked out before check-out.The worst disappointment was breakfast. On the website the picture shows tablecloths, baskets of fruit and assorted rolls, etc.- a very lovely-looking meal. It wasn't like that at all. There were loaves of bread still in the wrapper you could toast yourself, over-sweetened granola, day-old muffins, a juice dispenser and self-serve coffee which was often empty. No fresh fruit. No rolls. No tablecloths. Awful.With better management, this hotel could be a really lovely place to stay in San Francisco.

Tip: to get a multiday pass for the cable car and buses (a big moneysaver), go to the Visitors Ctr., don't wait in the line at the nearby cable car station. We arrived from the airport by BART ($5), no hassle, and an easy walk even with luggage. The hotel itself reminded me of the kind of little place you will find in a European city. Staff was friendly enough. The room was tiny but cozy, clean, shower large with good pressure. The breakfast is VERY basic, but with SF prices, might as well wolf down those muffins to fill up! Coffee and orange juice were both decent. Would definitely stay here again.Some tips: 1. Don't hesitate to use BART to get to this hotel, it's close. 2. Union Square has a booth selling half price theater ticket. We went to 2 shows within easy walking distance, and they were great. 3. Just up the street and around the corner is a place called Lefty O'Doul's that has meals and sandwiches served cafeteria style - good, filling, and very inexpensive. Same place is also a good pub, and has a piano bar every night - it was our hangout!","Apr 20, 2006","7","7",5,4,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_3435","Okay The location is really great and the breakfast is not bad (it also has granola and orange juice). Lots of europeans stay here and it is possible to make friends. The room is small (but not that small for SF patterns). The shower works great. The two problems I found were that the room was very smelly and that the hotel has no common areas at all (there is just one sofa in the back of the elevator in the first floor) to seat outside the room an relax. Since it was rainning a lot I missed that kind of area to spend some time (and did not want to stay much in the room because the smell was bad).","Apr 13, 2006","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_4694","Ideal location My girlfriend and I stayed at the Stratford March 7th through 9th and found it perfect for our needs. During working trips I've been placed at the Hyatt, Argonaut and several other 4 and 5 star SF hotels. I've always thought it was a shame someone was paying $300 TO $800 per night for my rooms when I was only there to sleep and shower. This recent trip to SF was for fun and we both agreed we'd rather spend our money on nice restaurants and shopping. We took a chance on the Stratford and found it absolutely ideal location-wise. Approaching the hotel we noticed the outside sign was parially removed and frankly it had a sort of skanky ramshakle look to it. But inside it smelled nice and the furnishings were rather hip. The clerk was courteous and helped us store our luggage since we arrived early (10:00am). Check-in is at 3:00 but he recommended we return about 2:00 pm and we did. At check-in I asked for a room away from the street. The rooms are small but clean and totally adequate. The room away from the street was probably a good idea since the street is very noisy. In the evening there was a full drum set and electric guitar set-up on the corner across the street from the entrance of the hotel but we heard nothing of it in our room. It must have been hell for rooms facing the street.Getting thereWe arrived at SFO and took the BART to Powell station in downtown SF ($5.15) which is only two blocks from the hotel. If you hate traffic and parking hassles the ease of getting to the Stratford from SFO is a huge relief. The one problem however are the lame and confusing BART ticket machines. Tokyo, NY, Rio and other big city metros are so much more visitor friendlyUnion Square is literally seconds from the hotel's front desk. The cable car runs in front of the hotel and Chinatown is a ten to fifteen minute walk away. We never needed a car but did take a taxi once.The free continental breakfast wasn't fancy but if all you need is some coffee or tea and a muffin or toast you'll be fine. If you need more there are dozens of places to get a full breakfast near by.I read from one reviewer that the elevator was very slow. Maybe that reviewer drinks too much coffee. It's slow but nothing to burst a blood vessel over. Just for fun I timed it and on the average it took 3 to 4 seconds per floor. I can deal with that. Of course if you want to take the elevator during peak check-out time or when people will be going out for dinner you may find yourself waiting a bit for the elevator to reach your floor or the lobby. Actually, we took the stairs down to the breakfast room to avoid that busy time.The bottom line is the Stratford is in a perfect location and suits travelers who don't need frills. It's clean and safe and in a way sort of hip. I would definitely stay there again! Maybe we should keep this place a secret!","Mar 30, 2006","8","7",5,4,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$148"

We were given a room on the 7th floor, it faced away from the street which i assume is a distinct advantadge as it can get quite noisy with trams etc. Room was small but the bathroom was large but for the money who cares, we went there to visit the city not sit in our room. Everthing seemed very clean as well. Staff were helpful. Breakfast is limited to toast and muffins with plenty of choice with drinks though. Again for the money who can complain, just so long as we had something to keep us going. We walked around a lot, San Francisco has a lot of distinct neighborhoods (and hills!) so be prepared. People were great, very helpful and laid back.

Room was very clean and bright - no a/c but not needed. Room was perpendicular to Powell and very quite.Serve a continetal breakfast on 2nd floor which looked fine - we ate at Lefty O'Doul's again! Liked Lefty's.Absolutely would stay at the Stratford again - paid about $ 120+ for Sir Francis on line and less than $ 60 on line at the StratfordLocation was great - if we return we will stay on Powell and not off Powell - not sure I would want to be more than 2-3 blocks either side of Powell.","Nov 23, 2005","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$148"

Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. One small elevator for 8 floors, so patience is required there. The complimentary breakfast is barely adequate (toast and packaged muffins), but the breakfast room was nice with big windows on Powell Street. Took advice of another writer and stayed at back side of hotel, away from Powell St. Think a room with windows over Powell St. on upper floors 7 or 8 would be fine.

We spent $91.20 (including taxes) for one night and it was fabulous. The rooms are small and furnished in IKEA decor, but it was clean, comfortable and felt very safe. The front desk clerks (both at check in and check out) were courteous and patient with some of the non-American guests we observed. We couldn't have been more pleased, especially after following a fellow TripAdvisor's advice and asking for an inside room away from Powell Street.

Parking was a couple blocks away at an affordable $20 per 24 hours. That included in and out service which is a good deal at a San Francisco hotel.We stayed on the top floor and had no prblem with noise. If our window was open, we could hear the bells of the cable car, but it was more charming than annoying.The rooms are on the small side, and the sink is right across from the bed. But it's not really much of a problem. They were in the process of repainting the lobby, so it looks like they are taking pride in the hotel to keep it looking nice.I would definately recommend staying at this hotel. The front desk staff was nice. The hotel includes a continental breakfast, though we were not up in time to take advantage of that. You really can't be the location. For the price, it's a great deal.

"hotel_133","hotel_3300","Best Value at the Stratford My wife and I just spent 3 wonderful nights at the Stratford. This is the place if you are budget conscious and just want a clean, quiet place to sleep after a long day of sightseeing. It's superbly located in the heart of Union Square district, steps away from shopping, theaters, countless restaurants and bars, and public transportation (buses, BART). We found the staff to be very courteous and helpful. A simple breakfast of toast/muffins, juice, and coffee is offered in a small dining room - it's all we needed.Yes, there is no air-con, but none was needed, even during the warm month of July, since the temperature cools down drastically at night. The only minor irritation was the slo-o-ow elevator that carries only 5 people at one time. But the pluses far outweigh the minuses. It's simply the best value in town for hotel accommodations.One tip: ask for a room on the inside, away from Powell Street.","Jul 20, 2005","9","9",6,4,1,5,1,5,1,"4","$148"
"hotel_133","hotel_4697","Great find for the money This hotel is a great find for people on a budget who still want to be in the heart of it all. You can't beat the location one block from Union Square, and five minutes walk from Chinatown. The room I stayed in (second floor, right next to the tea room) was small (not a problem for one person, might be limiting for two) but very clean (the sheets had a very pleasant Snuggle smell). There was no coffee maker in the room, and no glasses (I didn't ask, they might give you some if you do) but they had enough towels, tissues, shampoo, soap and a hairdryer. There's also a TV (didn't even turn it on) and a cityguide waiting for you.I found the room to be very quiet (someone was playing music very loudly on the street, but I couldn't hear a thing), probably because it didn't face the street but an interior wall.The complimentary breakfast itself is a great plus, they even had croissants!The staff was very pleasant, they even knew where I could get a new memory card for my camera!One more note - there's a strong incense smell in the lobby, not at all unpleasant, but if you are highly sensitive you should be aware of it.I wish I knew they give you a parking discount to one of the garrages around - the hotel doesn't have parking, and regular fees run around $25/day. To sum it up, if you are looking for plush amenities and a great view, it's probably not for you, if you just want a clean, pleasant place to crash at the end of the day that would be close to everything, I recommend the Stratford.","Jun 12, 2005","4","4",6,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$148"

I knew the hotel was going to be basic, but when you're booking Dec. 30 for New Year's Eve, you're just hoping for clean, basic place to sleep that is not scary. I don't know what floor the smelly carpet people were staying in, but we had a fine room. We got a queen bed with private bath in room 606. I could tell the room and carpets had been newly redecorated. It was a painted a cheery yellow, modern, simple furniture, a botanical print on the wall and ... (you can tell I'm a gal) tasteful, box-pleated dust-ruffles that I'd put in my own home. Anyone who pays that much attention to details in a budget hotel scores points with me. The bonus, for those of you who need to sleep during the day, are room-darkening curtains. Staff was nice and accomodating. The clientele, as is often the case on New Year's Eve, was young, so there was noise in the hallways that night. Other than that, I'd recommend it to my budget-conscious friends. It's right on the Powell-Stockton, Powell-Hyde cable car line, the 38 Geary bus, Union Square, close to Muni Metro, and so much more.","Jan 2, 2005","13","12",6,6,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$148"

I'm wondering if not all the rooms have been renovated since some people seem to complain about things that were not at all an issue for my friend and me. We stayed on a pretty high floor, towards the street, where the noise died down way before our bedtime so it was great for looking outside and seeing what everyone's wearing. The room looked bright and cheerful. The decor was minimal but modern and new. I would count it as a no-frills, clean (I can't figure out those carpet complaints from other people...), super reasonably priced, smak-dab in the middle of it location.

"hotel_134","hotel_1751","Mediocre at best Stayed here for 5 nights with my husband in December 2008. It's clean, no frills, and comfortable, yet pretty close to being run down and outdated (looks like it was built in the 60s or early 70s and was was remodeled in the early 90s). Pros: central location, affordable (we booked a package on Travelocity and the hotel was essentially free, but I wouldn't pay more than $50 a night) quiet, and staff was friendly and helpful. We asked the front desk if they could store our laptops for the day while we went sight-seeing (no safe in the room) which they did and were very accommodating. At the same time, the decor and fixtures are pretty dated and, as others have said, no frills. There is also a charge for internet and parking. (A parking fee I can understand--it's San Francisco, but not offering free internet is usually a deal-breaker for me). All in all I don't feel ripped off but I wouldn't stay here again.

It still has two-pronged electrical outlets by the sink, with an adaptor in between the outlet and the hairdryer.Despite being old, and not particularly loved by its ownership, it was clean and served the purpose that we were looking for--a clean bed at a cheap price in the City.","Nov 19, 2008","0","0",5,3,5,5,1,5,1,"3","$204"

"hotel_134","hotel_7715","Very Nice Experiance I recently stayed at this hotel for my 24th birthday. I was skeptical about it because of the reviews on here but to my surprise I found most of them to be wrong. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS HOTEL. We stayed in one of the one bedroom suites, which had an amazing view and tons of room. The carpet looked like it was new and the room was really clean. The suite had two bathrooms in it which was a nice surprise and they looked like they had been remodeled recently. The seating area had a pull out double bed, which was really comfortable for my guests. The room had a very elegant feel to it, with wrap around windows to create an amazing view of the city. The hotel staff was very accommodating. I went down and asked for two more blankets and they brought them back up to the room for me. In the morning I asked if we could have a later check out and they gave us two more hours, without chargeThe lobby of the hotel was really nice and check in and out was a breeze. Parking is extra but only $20 which is amazing for this city. The location of the hotel is really nice also. It is walking distance to Union Square, a $7 cab ride to the Marina. My only complaint is that the walls are thin and you can hear people in other rooms but that is typical of a lot of hotels and something that you just deal with when staying in a hotel. All in all I really enjoy this hotel and it is a steal of a deal when you look at the prices of other hotels around the area.

The night hotel staff was personable and friendly, even when I had to come back to the check in desk, as my electronic room key did not work (quite a trek hauling luggage and waiting for the elevator to come up to the eighth floor). The elevators were extremely slow and out of the three, I only saw two that were actually running the time that I was there. The room was very, very small (two doubles), and in a state of disrepair鈥攑eeling and scared wallpaper, peeling paint and mildew on the bathroom ceiling and poor lighting period (bath  room). Lots of noise from the hallway and street, even on the eighth floor. The beds were hard and the pillows were hard and flat; I did not sleep well at all. The conference rooms were also in disrepair, but the catered food was good. For the price that I paid ($129.00/night) plus parking, I do not feel that our large conference group got our money鈥檚 worth. I will not be staying at the Cathedral Hill Hotel again unless it is after a major and complete renovation of all of the rooms鈥攊t was a huge disappointment to say the least.","Nov 8, 2008","0","0",2,2,4,3,3,2,2,"3","$204"
"hotel_134","hotel_6275","Overall Nice Hotel We needed a room at the last minute, I booked the room, then read the reviews, I was a bit worried, but pleasantly surprised upon arrival. For the price of the room, free parking and a free buffet breakfast for everyone, not just a continental breakfast, a nice bacon, eggs, sausage, potatoes, french toast, danish, cereal, juices, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and more, it ended up being an extremely reasonable rate. The room was not beautifully decorated or freshly painted, but it was clean, big, and had computer access, showtime and a very clean bathroom. We needed help with the heater, a maintenance person was there within minutes to help. Service was excellent and staff was friendly. Basically if you are looking for a nice place to stay for a reasonable rate, this is a nice and clean place stay. The room smelled a little of smoke, but they have asked that no one smoke in the rooms, either they are still trying to get the smell out from past smoking rooms or people smoke in the room anyway. I dont think they want to decorate, paint and put a lot of money into it if they are just going to replace it with a hospital someday, that is what we were told is going to happen.","Nov 4, 2008","0","0",6,3,4,4,6,6,4,"3","$204"

"hotel_134","hotel_6696","Fred Flintstone has a softer bed Very disappointed with the room. First thing I noticed were the three huge stains on the carpet, next wal paper peeling from walls, then torn curtin in the room, and finally the mildew around windows in restaurant (great if you are trying to diet, guaranteed to curb your appetite), The elevator seemed to have a problem stopping on the 3rd floor. Had to wait over 5 minutes for one of the three elevators to stop on the third floor so I could board. I could see it going past the floor without stopping. Was beginning to wonder if I would ever be able to get on the elevator. Not good for disabled people who can't use stairs as a backujp.I have never slept on a bed so hard, my coworker described the bed as a Fred Flintstone bed, only Fred's bed is probably softer. Unfortunately I was there for a day business trip and spent non work related hours in the room. The room lacked adequate furnishings. The only chair in the room was an office chair, not very comfortable for watching the tiny television. Only good thing about the chair is that it could easily be moved close to the small television to see it better. Lack of an adequate chair to relax in forced me to spend 12 to 14 hours on the rock hard bed. The room was stuffy, it had an air conditioning unit, but even with my hand over the vent I could barely feel the air movement. Did not feel safe leaving the window open while I slept as it would have been too easy for anyone to walk along the roof and enter the room through the open window.Even though I was willing to pay for Internet access, the wireless access was not configured as a router, so I was unable to obtain an IP address to get onto the Internet. Hotel staff were unable to help with the situation. This was a critical feature for me as I needed to stay in contact with students enrolled in my online classes. The room service was quick and friendly and the food was good. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was good and reasonably priced, although plan to spend $4.50 for a class of orange juice, service was prompt and friendly.","Oct 25, 2008","0","0",2,1,3,1,4,5,1,"3","$204"

At that time we were treated very nice and was very understanding. The person at the desk asked that we stay at Cathedral Hill the next time. And because we were treated so kindly and with understanding we were. We arrived at a family member's house and told them what happened. They loaned us the money until we could work things out. Immediately I called Cathedral Hill back. They kindly rebooked the room and stated we could pay cash. On our arrival the next day, we were treated like some one from the tenderloins and asked to stand aside while they help other customers. After we paid cash we were given a room with the wallpaer peeling off, kept awake by our toilets as well as the neighbor's because they sounded like torpeedoes being deployed and there was mold in the shower as well as all over the curtain.

"hotel_134","hotel_10043","Room for improvement We arrived here after spending the previous night at the marvelous Bay Landing Hotel close to the airport and soon realised that we were not going to have it so good in SF central!We had sat nav so not too many problems finding the hotel, it's always tricky when you're in a new city but it stands out on a major road and is a big hotel.Once inside we checked in without too many issues. The place is a little dated and appeared to be undergoing a bit of a makeover. No free parking in the large underground car park but it was something like $12 a day which is not that bad in SF and when there is a group of people chipping in.The hotel room was fairly dull and had a bit of a strange smell, sorely in need of decoration and new carpets etc but not dirty. The bathroom was also very dated but bearable. Sliding doors didn't seem to lock properly either. I think some rooms had been refurbed, maybe if you complain they'll upgrade you but we are all fairly laid back and were eager to see the city rather than argue with hotel staff.The pool looked OK but the sun didn't seem to shine out there too often so we didn't bother. Cathedral Hill is a big hotel but only has a small bar/restaurant in the lobby and a small shop and coffee shop.Right across the street is 'Tommys Joynt' which is a good bar/carvery/diner. Open til very late, friendly staff and good value food if you don't want to search for a restaurant plus loads of beers. Opposite is a 50's style diner. Much nicer than IHOP. Hotel is probably about 3 miles from the Fisherman's Wharf area and 15min walk from city centre shopping etc, you can walk (long) or use public transport if not driving.We often walked through the area late at night and although there are some shady characters in the area they gave us no problems at all. I felt safer here than walking past drunk chavs in UK town centres but still, be alert and don't go down any dark alleys...I think Cathedral Hill is a little pricey and you should shop around before staying here. Staff on the whole were ok, not the happiest I've met but they weren't miserable either.If you're not too fussy and not a clean freak you'll probably be ok here, otherwise dig deeper and pay for something better.","Oct 7, 2008","1","0",3,3,4,3,4,4,1,"3","$204"
"hotel_134","hotel_2500","Great service, Fair price, Tired rooms. The Cathedral Hill Hotel was significantly less expensive than other hotels in the same area. The service was outstanding, with friendly, efficient staff and a reminder email when our reservation date was near. Online booking was easy and there were no problems with the reservation.We ended up staying in two different rooms because of a very loud pool party that was going on directly below the first room we were given. Management was extremely accommodating about changing our room and even let us check out the new room to be sure it was quiet. The lobby and restaurant areas are very nice, but the rest of the hotel is showing its age, though everything was clean. The floor indicator lights in the elevators didn't work. The first room we were given was in desparate need of at least a new coat of paint to cover all of the scuff marks. The second room looked as though it had been painted more recently, but both rooms had stained carpet, old-looking electrical outlets, and outdated tile and fixtures. The rooms also do not come standard with refrigerators. Rooms with refrigerators are available at an extra charge.While priced about $100 less than the Holiday Inn down the street, the Cathedral Hill was still below expectations for its $124 per night price tag. With some rennovation, it would be a great value. Of course, then they would probably have to charge more, so it may be this is what a reasonably priced motel in downtown San Francisco looks like.","Sep 30, 2008","0","0",3,3,3,4,6,6,1,"3","$204"

"hotel_134","hotel_2731","Not a bad place to stay Date: September, 2008Reviewer: Vicki and Tony, Sydney Australia We have just returned from 3 weeks in the United States. We started our holiday in San Francisco and stayed at the Cathedral Hotel located on Van Ness Ave. We found the best deal for San Francisco hotels on LastMinute.com.au. The hotel was clean and comfortable, the staff courteous and friendly. The noise however from busy Van Ness Ave was incessant and intrusive, so if you need something a little more quieter, then you should consider somewhere else or a room towards the back of the property. We were offered such a room on checkin for an extra US$50 a night, which we declined.The Cathedral Hotel is reasonably located, especially if you want to be near Union Square. It was an easy bus ride (or cable car if you wish to walk the 6-7 blocks) down to the Pier 39 and Fishermans wharf area.The hotel has a pool and a fitness area, but there is so much to do and see in San Francisco that we didnt have time to make use of these facilities and we got plenty of exercise walking around. One lesson that we learnt booking our accommodation on the internet and not knowing our way around American airports, is to enquire about shuttle services from the airport to the hotel, before you travel. We made this mistake and consequently spent a lot on taxis, on arriving at each destination. Once at the hotel we were able to organise a shuttle back, a much cheaper option.","Sep 21, 2008","0","0",5,5,4,5,5,5,4,"3","$204"

The 7th floor ice machine never worked and we had to go to the 6th floor to get ice, The elevator was scary and closed on my fingers at one point and it took so long I mean so long to go up or down.

I chose the property because it was one of the only choices (combining air  hotel) that had a room with 2 double beds as an option for a good price. Front desk staff were very efficient. We arrived in the early morning and they had us in our room by 11:00am. Our room, on the 5th floor, was just fine. A little dated perhaps, but clean with comfortable mattresses and pillows. No problem with the location as we purchased 3 day MUNI passes and the hotel is on the corner of 2 busy streets (Van Ness and Geary). We took the BART from the airport to the Civic Center and walked the rest of the way (about 13 blocks). The beginning of the California cable car line is close and easy to get on without waiting. We walked to Union Square the first day. Had one dinner at the hotel and it was nicer than expected. Staff throughout this hotel were pleasant and helpful (front desk, bell boy, cleaning staff, waiters) and our checkout took seconds. Took the shuttle back to the airport as it was reasonable. Cathedral Hill Hotel delivered as a good budget choice. (I have stayed in the tiny rooms around Union Square on previous trips.) Shopping in SF is fabulous and I would rather spend my money that way!

This hotel appears to have been built and decorated sometime in the 70's and has never been updated or improved. The staff were helpful and courteous. But, the carpet in our room was dirty and smelled. The linens were worn and all the fixtures were old and worn. It is a place to lay your head down at night only.

From check-in to check-out there is nothing to commend it. Check-in itself took over 20 minutes, and then when we got to our room it had not been cleaned from the previous occupants. We spent the whole day away from the hotel, and after a wonderful meal at Scomer's on Fisherman's Wharf, when we got back we decided to end the evening with an Irish coffee. It was 10:45pm and the first thing we were told was to hurry up with our order because they were closing at 11pm. The Irish coffe was bitter, cold, and I'm certain they forgot the liqor. The night was punctuated with noise, and at one point at around 4 am some errant person was shouting profanities right outside our door, leading my wife not being able to sleep for the rest of the night. In the morning, check-out took 30 minutes whilst it seemed all of the front-desk staff were chatting and partying in the back office.

"hotel_134","hotel_1445","Truly Awful Experience Had been looking forward to my time in San Francisco following 4 weeks in New Zealand. Sadly my expectations were severely let down. Following a 25 hour trip from my hotel in Christchurch (NZ) to Cathedral Hill I was greeted by a surly receptionist. I may have blinked when he smiled, certainly an unwelcoming check in experience.On entry to my room i was greeted with a bottle of wine from a friend who'd contacted the hotel prior to my arrival, a very nice thought, however was slightly tarnished when the bottle which was chilled on ice with glasses had not been privided with a corkscrew!!My room, like the rest of the building felt out of place for 2008, run down and shabby. An old a/c unit that could be hard to switch on for those guests who may have problems with gripping things. The shower had no proper mixing ability so it was hit or miss whether you had a scalding or freezing shower. There was no form of sound proofing and the room was loud 24 hrs a day, not condusive for relaxing. The concierge's inabillity to help or actually organise anything is truly astounding. Everything I learnt came through experiencing it for myself or through taxi drivers and local bar or restarauntuers. One prime example was being bundled into a limo to a shopping centre a couple of blocks short from Fermans Wharf. This journey was assured to be the same price as a taxi, yet was $17 as apposed to the $12 it costs from the hotel to the wharf.The ability of the staff is not the highest, a prime example occured when trying to change some sterling travellers cheques, the receptionist did not understand until i explained that sterling is Great British Pounds and therefore required an exchange rate. They were only able to offer an exhange rate that was over a week old. Another example was when enquiring about wireless internet I was advised the process. when i pointed out that giving your credit card details over an unsecure network was ridiculous and risky i was greeted with a blaze attitude. Since my return to the UK I have seen other reviews of this hotel that draw attention to my biggest concern, the location of the hotel. Cathedral Hill is on the corner of Van Ness  Geary. The location felt intimidating and seedy, several adult shops and massage parlours within an extremely short walk from the front door. There are also a large ammount of beggars in the area some of whom are agressive or intoxicated. I did not sample the bar or restaraunt because i felt less than inclined to give this hotel any more of the money I'd already paid to stay there, however was glad of the hotel's proximity to Mel's diner, a true american diner with great food  service.I would not recomend this hotel in the slightest and would expect more for the price and rating.

We just thought we should write to let others know that we enjoyed our stay more than any time in recent memory thanks to the outstanding service we received.The professionalism that staff posed from the first day was beyond excellent customer service. The first contact was with the gentlemen that assisted with the luggage. These gentlemen were very helpful with maps and directions around the city throughout our stay. The lobby was clean and very receiving. The rooms were clean and housekeeping was very adaptable to our needs. The pool and Japan area was immaculate and inviting. We had the opportunity to enjoy your dining area of the Jack Tar Restaurant. We arrived 15 minutes prior to closing and ther staff treated us with the upmost courtesy. We did not feel rushed they were very courteous and professional. The food was excellent. We ordered the clam chowder which was the most delicious that we have ever tasted. We must recommend it to anyone who visits the area. The presentation of the soup was wonderful we really enjoyed the Laughlin soup bowl. As we write we would like to know where to purchase them. We have been searching on the internet since my arrival. The hotel was in walking distance of many of the cities attractions. There was a bus stop located in front of the Cathedral Hotel that would take you to the warf and North BeachOur stay was the most pleasant and we will let our friends and family know of how well we were treated while staying at your establishment.

"hotel_134","hotel_3668","Pricey and could be better Just returned from San Francisco where we spent (4 of us) 5 nts at the Cathedral Hill Hotel. I had read some negative reviews before leaving and was very nervous about staying here. As previously pointed out it is a very large hotel and the area is most definitely awful, the only complaints we really had in our family room was that there were only ever enough towels left out for 2 people. Also we were unable to open the window. On the plus side the beds were very comfortable and the room was big enough for us. We had also stayed in LA the week previously and compared to that we found CHH overpriced for what we got. The pool area was nice, though we didn't actually get to use it which was another bone of contention, as we arrived back early on our final full day in order to have a swim and relax only to find there was a private pool party and we could not be admitted. I do feel guests should have been advised of this in advance. Not the sort of hotel you would pick if you want a quiet hotel either as it was very noisy, there was something going on every evening but we didn't mind that, there's plenty to look at, you may even bump into Elton John!! As someone previously recommended, 'Tommys Joynt' across the street was a big hit , not everybodys cup of tea but it definitely worked for us.","Jul 1, 2008","3","2",3,3,2,4,4,4,3,"3","$204"

Upon arriving I thought I'd see Cecil B Demile filming an old movie. The lobby was right out of old Hollywood, and I took a 'Gloria Swanson' picture of my wife cascading down the huge staircase, ready for her 'closeup'. It was a lot of fun. I believe the rooms have been recently updated because ours was very nice and showed no signs of wear and tear at all. The shower was awesome with great water pressure and unlimited hot water.

Overall it was ok but its position is not ideal as some of the streets surrounding are rather suspect and you wouldn't want to walk round the area after dark. The main problem we had was with the barman. Despite the information in our room, the hotel bar does not open after 11pm. We rate this as fairly pathetic for hotel guests and complained to reception the following day (in room info quotes 1am). We were told that the bar closes if no customers are there. However as there was a tour group of about 20 people it should have stayed open. The following evening (our last) we wanted a farewell drink with our fellow travellers but again the barman refused to serve us after 10.45. His arrogant reply was that our name was not on his pay check! Excuse me, as the customer I expect I am his employer! They obviously don't understand the saying that 'customer is always correct' in the US.

There were not really sufficient towels and the flush on the loo was *very* suspect!The computer gave 60 mins for $8 and it loaded quickly which was good.The pool was lovely and tranquil, set in nice gardens but no-one from the hotel around.I like a swim every day and when I went I felt intimidated with a large group of young people doing somersaults, back flips etc and taking over the whole pool.Their language was dreadful and they spent much time loudly discussing which drugs to take to the evening's party!Whilst this is not obviously the fault of the hotel I felt that a person seen to be about might have made it nicer for others.Once this group moved on then it was fine and everyone else felt able to return to the pool.There's not really enough sun loungers and the pool towels are small and rather threadbare.This hotel is a long walk from anywhere particular and the cable cars etc are also not nearby.I would definitely avoid it if I went back to SF and would most definitely stay on the Wharf.Mel's Diner over the road was quite nice, we daren't walk too far in this area looking for an alternative!","Jun 21, 2008","1","1",4,4,2,5,6,5,5,"3","$204"

"hotel_134","hotel_8255","Cheap rack rates, spacious, stingey, does the job The rack rates (about $119) are as good as discounted hotwire or similar rates in other hotels in SF. You can stay at a lot nicer places for the same money if you use a discount booker like hotwire. BUT - that's not always an option, plus it's nice to know in advance where you are staying. So their rates are pretty fine for SF if you don't have the time or inclination to go searching hard.The rooms are spacious and fine. Nothing special. The usual - TV, bathroom with tub, desk, large - VERY firm bed.The location is superb - better than in the main shopping/cable car area in my opinion. We stayed off Taylor / O'Farrel the previous few days, and whilst it's near the cable cars, Van Ness in our opinion is far better located (the cable cars are next to useless - too long a wait). Van Ness runs right down to the Fisherman's Wharf and there are cheap ($1.5) busses running all the time. It;s not a bad walk either - especially the downhill direction :-) - It;s also a 10 minute walk back to the main shopping district on Market St.Also a short bus or walk to the Cow Hollow area for superb restaurants and shopping - very upscale.My major gripe with the Cathedral Hill Hotel is their mean / stingey streak. They really need to get up to date with charges. The extras they charge for and should not do:$12 a day for Internet access (no free hotspots in range) - this should be FREE everywhere now, and mainly is.Room service - Mandetory 15% tip plus $2 extra. This wouldn't be so bad if their menu was not so mean. For example - if you order their burger you pay Extra for onions!!! Extra for cheeese, Extra for pepper - Extra for anything. I mean, come on, paying for onions on a burger.This just reinforces the old reputation hotels had for stitching you up the moment you stepped foot inside. Needless to say we have paid for nothing - ordering food in from outside etc.A small but important thing they need to change.

I could feel the springs thru the hard mattress, so it wasn't a great nights sleep. Customer service was fine, no problems there. Would I recommend or stay there again, absolutely not.

"hotel_134","hotel_6300","Never again My family and I stayed at this hotel which is owned by California Pacific Medical Center and the American Cancer Society when a relative had a kidney transplant. The reservations agent was less than hospitable when I booked, but that could be overlooked if the guest room wasn't shockingly filthy. The first room we were assigned had food reminents and dirt on the walls and the bathroom floor is one I would never walk on without shoes and would rather not walk on with shoes. We asked to switch rooms. The second room had less dirt on the walls but there was scummy dirt on the hair dryer and once again a frightening floor in the bathroom. The website says the rooms have been renovated but a new bed spread, chair, and cutains is not the place to start. The carpet needed to be replaced, there was a brown mystery substance on one of the curtains, an exposed electric socket, the wallpaper is hanging and there was rust all over the bathroom-including a rusted mirror that is bolted to the counter and has seen God knows what in terms of use. I would not recommend this hotel until they actually renovate it. The location was good and the package rate ($89 which included parking, and breakfast buffet) would have been good if I wasn't waiting to catch something from the room. It's appalling to me that a hospital and a nonprofit could allow such filth. I also noticed that comments have been left about the ac units not working back in October 2007-there still not fixed! Stay somewhere else even if it costs more. One more thing-the shuttle to Cal Pacific does not run on weekends and nobody informed the family of this. In fact, the reservations person gave me the times for it and didn't bother to mention that it doesn' t run on the weekends. A couple of family members were waiting for it to come Sat morning. It's @ $7 cab ride to the hospital.","Feb 11, 2008","0","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$204"

The rooms are perfectly clean, even if it needs renovation, but the bed was comfortable and clean, so was the bathroom... both essential to a good stay. Besides, while in SFO you hardly spend too much time in your room! The location was way better than we thought, a nice walk to Pacific Heights and the Civic Center, a 5 dollar cab ride to Union Square (you could walk but I don't know if you run through seedier areas, but at least the hotel area is quite safe), and buses right there that take you anywhere in the city. Also, the parking lot was a big plus in San Francisco, and quite a reasonable daily price ($20), we parked the car for our stay and walked everywhere.I would definitely come back, it's a great value and we had an amazing time in the city!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Nov 23, 2007","3","3",6,5,6,6,5,5,1,"3","$204"

I had to plug the laptop into the bathroom and use it sitting on the floor because the power cord wouldn't reach the desk. Moreover, the wireless connection is not free and it's terrible.

The location of the hotel is ok, but it's still a good distance from Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square, the main attractions in San Fran. On arriving at the hotel, I checked in at reception and the guy who dealt with my check-in was very unhelpful. We had pulled up in our car right outside the door and did not know where to park it. The guy at reception barely told me where the car park was before shouting next in line having already taken my credit card details and getting paid up front for the accommodation. The car park is a nightmare to navigate, one of the worst I've seen and as for trying to get to the hotel lobby from the car park, it's like a maze. We ended up on the 7th floor of an adjoining medical centre, with our heavy luggage in tow, which no-one had offered to help us with and which we had to carry out of the car park up stairs as there were no lifts from our level. The room was adequate for what you pay for, small but sufficient, but the noise is terrible. There is constant street noise, the hotel is located on a block, so there's no avoiding it. The air conditioning is an old-fashioned fan/radiatior which whirrs all night and can't be turned off. The worst thing about the hotel though is the noise. At 5.30am some big-rigs pulled up on the street outside our bedroom window and proceeded to load and unload cargo...beeping and banging for at least an hour. The pool is small and the fitness centre has only 1 treadmill. When we asked to change to another room, a second guy at reception was not very helpful and said It's a hotel in the city...what can ya do...it's noisy, everywhere is noisy...great public relations skills there. All in all, it's a big hotel in the San Francisco city and people will be tempted by its location, but pay a bit more at a better hotel, it'll be worth it in the end.","Oct 23, 2007","3","1",3,2,3,4,2,4,4,"3","$204"

Also on arrive noticed wet carpet by both beds, informed desk and was told we could not have another room as the hotel was full. I assume hospitality training is not essential to acquiring a job in American Hotels. Next day still no rollaway and a dreadful musty smell coming from carpet. Complained to desk and was finally moved to another room, this time with a rollaway bed that was lumpy and very uncomfortable. I should have saved my $20 per night as my son crawled into the bottom of my bed anyway. Fitness centre had one bike and a weight machine that was useless as the cord was broken, water machine was empty and room smelt.

The ac didnt work very well and we were on street side so it was too noisy with the windows open. I would request a nonstreet room if possible. I wasnt too thrilled with the area the hotel was in either, but we didnt stray too far from the immediate hotel area at night. The bus stops right in front of the hotel so that made it convenient not having to have a car in the city. We did rent a car one day and there is an Enterprise location below the lobby in the parking garage.

"hotel_134","hotel_6578","Clean but scary... and it is not just the hotel. My husband and I were going on vacation to San Francisco and read some tough reviews on this hotel. I decided though, for the price of $164 US/night, that I would stick it out and make up my own mind as well (something that other reviewers also said). In addition, I thought that the area would still be a prime spot to be in where it was supposedly close to Union Square. All these presumptions were proven wrong when my husband and I arrived. The hotel is indeed in need of a lot of work. You can tell immediately that they are trying to keep it intact for as long as they can without sinking too many funds into overhauling the hotel. The hotel is very outdated and although the rooms are very, very clean, the peeling wallpaper and questionable brown-grey carpet truly show the age of the hotel. The biggest test we placed on the hotel though was taking a walk down to Union Square in the early afternoon going east on Geary. From Van Ness Ave. to about Jones St. my husband and I had 2 thoughts: move fast and MYOB. Now, I'm a seasoned traveler. It's not like I've never seen a homeless person on the street before or someone sketchy that I should walk around and avoid. I have to say though, in this situation we raced through about 5 blocks of complete slum where we saw some pretty scary people and actually felt nervous enough to want to walk fast. After these few blocks the neighborhood finally changes up and does a complete 180 where you start to see some nice art galleries and business folks around. This was the last test before we decided that it was time to switch out to another hotel in Union Square. Truly, the walk from Cathedral Hill Hotel to Union Square was not long (approx. 9 blocks... 15 - 20 minutes) and we would have continued to stay at the Cathedral Hill Hotel for the location and reasonable rate however, given the slummy area we had to cross to get to Union Square and the old looking rooms, it was not worth $164/night. If anything, the rooms are only worth $99 at best and that's already pushing it. We ended up moving to the Hilton on 333 O'Farrell the next day where it was only 5 minutes away from all the shopping you can imagine in Union Square... and the area was much more comfortable to walk in! Overall, if you don't care about the scummy area and can put up with the old rooms then by all means stay at Cathedral. For all of you who are think like we do, take your money elsewhere where you know you will be happy for an extra $70 a night. My husband and I decided that we would truly hate our vacation in San Francisco if we continued to stay at Cathedral Hill Hotel. The last thing we wanted to do was to wreck our own vacation. Sometimes, money isn't everything and all of you should keep this mind if you are about to book at Cathedral Hill Hotel.","Sep 28, 2007","5","5",1,2,2,3,4,1,4,"3","$204"

To be fair the tour should not use this hotel and use one either at fishermans wharf or union square. i will never use it again and advise my friends to avoid it.

The hotel at one time was probably in the same category as the St Francis but has not been kept up in all areas. The lobby was very dated but you could tell it was still a very elegant place. Carpet and furnishings were all outdated but not threadbare and certainly everything was VERY CLEAN. The bed in the room and the towells and linens were all new and could not have been cleaner.

Just one word of caution: if you're arriving from SFO, the nearest BART station to this hotel is Civic Center Station (Very scary, especially at night, not kidding! locals all know this). So get off in another station before or after and you should be fine. The hotel is about 6 or 7 blocks from the Macy's Building in Union square which really isn't so bad.

We checked in for three days in February and stayed at room 304 which was a huge room (non-smoking) with a nice comfortable king size bed. The carpet looked new, our windows looked out into Van Ness and the front of the hotel. The heater worked. We had plenty of space. The bathroom was fine.I knew that the hotel was near the Tenderloin district, so don't take the #38 bus which runs along Geary, it's always crowded and there always seems to be so many homeless taking this bus. Take the the #2 or 3 to Market Street instead or #47 or 49 along Van Ness to get to the Wharf.The location of the hotel is not central, you really need to use the public transportation system if you don't have a car. If you do have a car, there's no problem as they have parking available. Overall, for the price and the hotel's amenities, it's fine.","Feb 12, 2007","5","5",4,4,3,4,4,4,1,"3","$204"
"hotel_134","hotel_1855","Brilliant room This hotel was magnificent, the friendliness of the staff on reception and the pleasantness of the roommaids, made for an totally enjoyable visit.We had booked a double room on the internet directly with the hotel. This room was enormous, it had all the necessary furniture to please not only the traveller, but the businessman as well. When we arrived we had two bottles of wine on the table to welcome us. A touch that not all hotel use to make the traveller comfortable, but it gives a real good first impression.The bed and pillows were really comfortable, and at last an airconditioning system that actually workedWe ordered two meals via room service during our stay and both times these turned out to be exceptional in presentation and quality.We found this hotel to be close to all the sights that San Franscisco is famous for. This was an added plus.There was only one negative point, and that was the plug in the bath did not work correctly, so when we took a bath we had to either try to keep our foot on the plug to make sure it stayed down or surround the plug with a flannel. This minor problem did not in anyway detract from the enjoyment of such sumptious surroundings.I would definately stay at this hotel again.","Jan 16, 2007","7","7",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"3","$204"

"hotel_134","hotel_8379","No, No, No to the Cathedral Hill We booked a room at the Cathedral Hill Hotel as part of a package. We had been in the lobby a couple of years ago and it looked fine. My husband and I ended up in three rooms in 24 hours. We arrived at midnight. We did notice that night the carpet was filthy. (I wore socks the whole time we were in the room.) In the morning, we saw the toilet was leaking on the bathroom floor. That was room number one. For a thirty dollar per night charge we upgraded. Number two was a large room with a couch and 2 queen sized beds. It had been renovated but the carpet had wine stains and the back of the couch looked as if a cat had ripped the material. But the toilet didn't leak. We were out for the day. On our return, my husband went to wash his hands and discovered something disgusting had backed up into the sink. Room number three was directly above room number two. The couch was only stained not shredded but nothing leaked or backed up the rest of our stay. The room was supposedly cleaned but there was a pretzel stick under the desk. For the next two days, we checked to see if maid service got rid of that pretzel. They didn't. So in our first 24 hours, we packed and unpacked three times. Upon complaining to the management, the $30 /day upgrade was dropped. We would never stay there again. If only we had checked with Tripadvisor first.","Dec 14, 2006","7","6",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$204"
"hotel_134","hotel_3152","Nothing resembling a Cathedral... We wound up here because our booked hotel had a mishap. The history of the hotel is somewhat interesting - many famous people have stayed here, but you will note that none very recently and for good reason. It is actually a newer hotel - less than 50 years old - but more resembles a hospital on the outside. It isn't incredibly close to anything - Union Square is 10 blocks away (and not a nice walk down Geary Street at night) and Japantown is 7 blocks the other direction. Chinatown is 15 blocks away and the Wharf is an hour walk - but manageable. If you can't walk, avoid the main bus line, it is over crowded and nasty. A cab is your best bet but be aware that most of them take about the least direct route as possible. The hotel caters to business travelers.Our room was tiny and on the third floor. The outside temp was about 55F, but inside it was near 85F. The AC was running full tilt but a 90 year old granny with a walker could create more breeze. (Not to mention the air was warm...) The only option was to open the window and on the corner of two busy streets, the traffic noise was almost too much to deal with. The staff was not especially courteous - but neither were they rude. The only good thing is that we got to stay for Free - thanks to our other hotel. They do appear to have started some rennovations - but with the size of this hotel - looks like it could be a long time in the making.","Nov 16, 2006","0","0",3,3,3,3,4,4,5,"3","$204"
"hotel_134","hotel_10094","A 3-star hotel, just adequate rooms, probably a fair price for SF Our rooms were clean and adequate, and smallish. We booked the premier queen rooms. These are supposed to be their best rooms they have next to a suite. Well, I think some are better than others, but if our rooms were just adequate I'm not sure what the standard rooms would be like. It's located a few blocks further from the main shopping and dining attractions than other downtown hotels and as such is price a little lower than similar hotels. The best deal of all is that parking, which can be very expensive in San Francisco, was only $10 a day with a promotional package. The regular parking is $20/day which is still cheaper than many. When you compare hotel room costs in San Franciso, if you need parking for a car, be sure to find out how much it is at each hotel. One hotel we liked alot charged $42.50 per day.

I was worried about the whole Tenderloin thing but that wasn't an issue. This hotel seemed like it was nice in 1970 or something. Then when we heard it was being torn down we assumed that is why they haven't updated it. The bar area was really nice and they had a great little coffee shop but that was it. The room was horrible. I wish I had read the prior review first that said to change rooms because we must have gotten the low class room with stains on the carpet and the hardest bed in the universe. It was just dingy.

The hotel is given a 3 star rating by some sites and I think that is stretching it a bit. I'd call it a pretty good 2 star. We booked on priceline expecting a 3* in the downtown area. When told the result and checking the reviews, we became concerned and called the hotel and priceline. My wife can be calmly assertive and the manager moved us up to a 'superior room'. The room was clean and beige with a nice view of the Japanese pool area and a little balcony. The bed was bad and we had a hard time with the springs. Again we calmly and assertively spoke to the manager (Scott) who moved us to a 'premier room' on 7th floor. He told us it was a 4 star room. It was very nice (still beige!) and the bed was amazing. Here are some pros and cons for this hotel: Pro: Good location-NOT a scary area, great restaurants in the area- Mels,Johnny's, Kyoto Sushi, friendly staff and very helpful, (a toast to Scott), very convenient transportation, plain but clean rooms. Con: noisy (old windows), big range in room quality, stair wells need a major cleaning, little things like burnt light bulbs, hair dryer didn't work, glasses weren't replaced, yadayada.

Unfortunaly for my husband this hotel and the area surrounding it ruined his experiance of San Fran. Im not really sure why the tour company decided to put us in this hotel being so near the tenderloin area and we were very dissapointed-something i shall be taking up with them. On our way from Sacremento the tour guide told us to be in the hotel by 9pm, not something you really want to hear when your on holiday! On getting to the hotel and to our room we only had one case, they had put the other one in the another room, lucky for us they were honest enough to take the case to reception as i was going down to complain.The room its self was horrible, they had stuck things back on the wall with tape, the bed was uncomfortble and small by American standards, there were lots of Ants (friends of ours had to be moved rooms because of the ant infestation) and the shower was very questionable and noisy.My husband and i are not fancy travellers and had just spent the previous 12 days in budget accomodation which was fine by us but we were seriously unimpressed with this.The only good thing i have to say about this hotel was when we wanted to get a taxi the bell man was very helpfull and got us a very good deal.I think we were lucky to have good company with us and 3 nights was certainly enough at this hotel.This has put my husband off from ever going to San Fran again but i loved it there (besides the hotel) and if i get the chance to go again i would stay down by the Wharf.

"hotel_134","hotel_7126","More than adequate I first stayed at the Cathedral Hill -- it was then known as the Jack Tar -- nearly 40 years ago. I stayed in it again for two nights this month. The hotel was OK in the 1960s; it's still OK.Rooms are large and well kept. Bathrooms and closets are tiny (as were those in most hotels decades ago), but clean and supplied with the essentials -- including abundant hot water -- as well as an automatic coffee maker. A good-sized television set sits in a large cabinet with three or four large drawers.The Cathedral Hill has a good enough restaurant and a nice bar. On the patio (4th) floor there's a large Japanese garden that is a nice place for snacks, drinks, and just lounging about. (Some fourth floor rooms open directly onto the garden, or patio.)The hotel also has a newsstand and other shops. Parking is available; at US$22 a night -- not expensive by San Francisco standards (and the price allows unlimited ins-and-outs).Being at Van Ness and Geary, the Cathedral Hill is not located near San Francisco's main attractions; but the city is small enough that most are within a (somewhat long) walking distance. There are several decent restaurants in the area and Japantown, with the most reasonably priced sushi (and other dishes) in the city, is a five-minute drive away.","Sep 19, 2006","0","0",6,5,4,6,6,6,1,"3","$204"
"hotel_134","hotel_8376","It's the pits! Sorry we didn't move to a different hotel. This hotel was foisted on us by RCI time-shares, and was presented as an up-scale establishment. When we pulled up, I was very worried, but the lobby was in excellent shape, and seemed promising. What a disappointment! When we checked in, I specifically asked for a quiet room, as we have a kid with sleep problems. So, of course, they put us on the Van Ness side of the building which is incredibly noisy. Everything you read in the negative reviews is true. Frankly, the people who say this place is okay for the money are dreaming. After we got to our room, we had a lengthy discussion about checking out and moving to the Courtyard, where you at least get free internet. Cathedral Hill has Wi-Fi only, at a cost of over $15 per day. Even the Holiday Inn up the street had free internet service.Negatives: Rooms and hallways are filthy. We asked housekeeping to at least take care of the mildew mural in our shower. Was never cleaned up. Last 2 days of our stay one of the elevators was out of service and consequently had extremely lengthy waits to get downstairs. Absolutely NO amenities beyond a blow-dryer, iron and coffe maker. No refrigerator, no free internet, absolutely THE MOST uncomfortable beds I have slept in in 20 years of traveling for business. I want to know who the people were who posted the review that said they had wine in their rooms! What hotel was that?! And the icing on the cake: I heard people requesting refrigerators, so we asked for one to be sent to our room. Bien sur! Only $5 per day to have a refrigerator in your room. Outrageous. I'm surprised they didn't charge for the air we were breathing.Also, because of the proximity to the Tenderloin, there really are a tremendous number of homeless people around the hotel, and some of them are pretty aggressive about working the tourists.Positives: 1. Hotel security and the guys working the garage were very nice and very helpful. 2. It's across the street from Tommy's Joynt restaurant, absolutely the best meal buy in town. Tommy's Joynt consistently ranked as Best Cheap Eats in town by SF Chronicle. Van Ness Bakery across the street is a great bargain for breakfast. 3. You can get the bus to ATT Park right in front of the hotel.Net/net, no way is this a 3-star hotel. I have stayed in Super 8s that were far cleaner and better appointed.P.S. Mel's Diner is over-priced and over-rated.

"hotel_134","hotel_9183","our experience was just fine! We also were skeptical after reading some of the reviews for this hotel, especially since it was a new addition to the RCI Point system. We had a week long reservation for a queen room (all that was available at the time) and needed one night before our week started. Having looked at the photos on the website we noticed that the beds seemed really square (in our experience that means hard) and the pillows very flat in the standard rooms so we upgraded for our single night stay. Our king bed was the most comfortable we have slept on, the pillows great and the room had a pool view with a balcony (this was a premium room for $60 upgrade). I wouldn't say the staff isn't friendly, they are just job focused and not people focused. They don't make conversation easily, but after a week we managed to get smiles and a few sentences out of them. If you ask for information about the city, you do get it in a concise sentence which is what some people may consider the rudeness, but really, most people we ran into in San Francisco were the same way-not very conversational. When it came time to check into our real room with RCI the clerk asked if we would just like to stay where we were (bed upgrade and room upgrade) and that it would just be the same $60 extra per night. We agreed, paying 60 a night for a hotel in San Francisco was unheard of. Sure we could have moved to our standard room and stayed for free, but this was vacation! All in all we liked the hotel, especially the central location and nearness to the California St.cable cars just 4 blocks to the north. One warning, DON'T go walking from the hotel to Union Square via Geary or O'Farrell-this area is very dicey and really looked like the set of a New York cop show. Many homeless, prostitutes and drug users in the doorways. No one hassled us (we obviously didn't belong in the neighborhood) but it was uncomfortable. Walk 4-5 blocks NORTH to California St (and Starbucks!) and get on the cable car to go to Union Square. You MUST eat at Mel's diner on the corner!

As I understand it, the hotel is slated to be torn down in approximately 18 mos  I don't think the day can come soon enough!!! I also think, as far as the staff is concerned, tear down day is tomorrow  they are simply marking time until they find jobs elsewhere-I have NEVER seen such poor attitudes across the board as there is here. I asked 4 people, over the course of 2 days, at the front desk  bell stand, for a list of local restaurants in the area-NO ONE could give me anything. Even a place like Travelodge can do better!!! The hotel itself is very run down  the room I have, which they tried to charge me an 'upgrade' fee of $25/night for, is dirty, plain  simple. The rug is dirty, the walls are dirty (I don't even want to guess what ran down the walls between the beds), the bedding smells dirty...you name it, it's dirty, ripped, or torn. However, you could say it's a perfect complement to the area the hotel is in-dirty  rundown. AC in the room doesn't work, but at least the windows open  it's cool enough that the lack of AC doesn't really matter, however, it is a further sign of the overall deterioration of the hotel.

My 17-year old son and I were taking a college tour trip and stopping off in SF. He had not been to SF before and this hotel did not help the image of the city - on the website, they shot it at night and it looked pretty good for the price. In the daytime it looks pretty bad and it is in a creepy part of town - the Tenderloin district - not an area you want to walk at night. The concierge was never at his post so it was difficult to get answers to questions. I must admit there were some ok things about it - a cute little pastry shop for coffee and danish in the morning is in the lobby. Access to public transportation; i.e., the streetcars wasn't too bad.

But, despite the low price and to me great location (I enjoy Polk St., all the Thai restaurants, and other great hole in walls) I doubt I'll stay there again and pay the extra money to stay somewhere else. I stayed there for 4 days including the weekend. This was my second stay so, I requested to be on the garden view side ... not much of a view but, very quiet since you are not facing Van Ness. But, given the low price, the Cathedral Hill as become known to locals as the Go-tel. On both Friday and Saturday night, once I stepped out of the elevator, I felt I walked into one of the Adult nightspots such as Mitchell Bros or New Century which are a few blocks down from the hotel. Let's just say lots of loud adult sounds (not the TV) and just hope you don't have a child with you. In addition, many parties were going on in the rooms too. In fact, on my floor security had to clear out two rooms due to a fight breaking out. Apparently, both rooms were filled with teenagers; drinking and doing drugs.During the workweek, the hotel was not as booked and it was more quiet overall. Being an ex-resident of San Francisco, I go back several years on business. From what I was told on this visit when meeting with local friends, the site where the hotel sits is going to be turned into a hospital. If true, that explains why the carpet is terrible, the decor is very outdated, and the bathroom is something to laugh at. I am very tall and the shower head did not reach the middle of my chest. I had to do yoga-like moves in order to wash my face and hair. The TV is terrible with a half-dozen channels. The room was pretty much the same as my last stay almost a year ago but, again, I was attracted by the price and figured I'd give it a second try.In fairness, this is what you get for the price being so inexpensive. The staff was very nice and they do accomadate. No issue with the staff. Although many here have issue with the area, that is secondary to me. I actually like the area as it is as real as SF gets but, when in a hotel I want to feel like I've escaped the outside elements; not bring them inside with me. I want to be able to walk into a room and kick my shoes off; not feel I have to keep them on because the carpet is so dirty. I want variety on the TV if relaxing ... I want quietness ... I want a clean functionable bathroom ... I don't want to hear what others are doing in their rooms. It's those reasons why I won't stay there again regardless of price. As mentioned, location is about as urban as SF gets. You do have to cross the Tenderloin to get to downtown. A walk to downtown shopping and the theater district is 15 minutes. So, you will see all the negative elements that SF has to offer (homeless, prostitutes, drug addicts, panhandlers). Polk St. is just one block down which has a mix of everything. The immediate area has everything from cheap good restaurants, small bars, clubs (straight, gay, and transgender), shops, coffee houses, as well as adult entertainment. City Hall as well as the Opera House are close by. Basically, everything is walkable. I say a great location if a single traveler, boyfriend/girlfriend traveler, clubber, nightowl, bar hopper, or couple with no kids who are on an adventure. Not recommended if you are a family with children or a business traveler who desires a quiet area and expect business style or executive accomadations.","Dec 21, 2005","10","10",6,2,1,2,1,5,1,"3","$204"
"hotel_134","hotel_1086","Not the Plaza, but not too bad. After reading some of the reviews on this hotel I was a bit worried. I was traveling with my husband and 8-month old son and was concerned about the cleanliness of the room. Check in was a breeze ... parking was very convenient ($20 extra per day) - right below the hotel. There is very low clearance, though. We were in a Sequoia and it barely cleared. We opened the sunroof and could touch the ceiling with our hands. Parking stalls are also pretty narrow. We were on the 8th floor in a very clean, very quiet room. Of course, it was fleet week and the Blue Angels were performing. That was the only noise we heard, though. TV's had the general cable channels as well as Starz. Pay-per-view movies and games were available. Complimentary (small) bottles of wine were in the room too ... a red and a white.The bathroom is small and the shower is VERY dark once you close the shower curtain. There were nice towels and bathrobes to use. Also, there was a nice vanity mirror with a light for make up. We didn't eat at the restaurants, but probably would have had we not had existing dining plans with family and friends. There is a small espresso/pastry shop in the lobby, a bistro/grill restaurant (menu looked great) and then a more casual breakfast buffet area. There is a 24-hr Mel's Diner across the street. I was tempted to go grab some pancakes when my son woke up at 3 am :). There is also a pastry/donut/coffee shop across the street. There is an area to sign up for tours, etc. or general directions in the city and there is a small store for essentials and souvenirs. I met some friends for dinner that night and the hotel graciously called a taxi for me, escorted me out to the pick up area and told the driver where I was headed. Overall I think the staff was awesome and the accommodations were nicer than your typical Ramada/Best Western, etc., but not quite as nice as Westins/Hyatts. Of course, there could be nicer/larger rooms in this hotel ... we just pricelined it and booked the smallest one. As for the location, it is several blocks ($7 cab ride) to Union Square and a little bit further to the restaurants in North Beach. It worked well for our purposes, though, of visiting friends in different areas of the city.Check-out was just as smooth. We were on our way in about two minutes. All in all, not a bad experience at all. Nice lobby, nice staff and a clean room are exactly what I need in a hotel.","Oct 11, 2005","14","14",5,4,1,5,1,5,1,"3","$204"

Hotel is in a decent location close to Muni stops w/lots of restuarants and stuff within walking distance. Used public transport the whole weekend, never more that 20 min. or one transfer to anywhere we wanted to go. Hotel not the newest, fanciest in the city and the rooms are small.

Street noise on the Van Ness Ave side is continuous day and night. If only the air conditioning had worked even a little, then keeping the windows open would not have been necessary. Thank goodness the weather was very cool. First night there a big time afterhours party got cracking about 2am down the hall with about 50 loud and obnoxious people who had to be shut down by security, but not until 3:30am! The room itself was kept spotless by housekeeping, but the furnishings were very old and Motel 6ish. Room lighting left a lot to be desired. Three lamps but all with those fluorescent bulb inserts that combined with the yellowed lampshades made me feel like I had hepatitis everytime I looked into the mirror. The beds were reasonable good, but the blankets were old and pilled and the sheets had holes in them. The pillows were just plain awful. Put the rooms on the 7th floor on the fast track for renovation! The garage below the hotel was convenient, but very crowded and tight to get in and out.

It's a very good deal for being a budget hotel in the midst of San Francisco citylife. I was perfectly okay having my 4 year old son here, as well as my senior citizen relatives -- all of whom were comfortable enough with the hotel and the rooms to nap during the day! Like the other reviews, it may need a facelift, but the rooms were clean enough (though a bit on the small side), and the staff was very good. Beds were comfy, and as long as you don't open the curtains all the way (to reveal the wall between the windows), the rooms are bright and airy :) The restaurant downstairs has good food. And the LOCATION is GREAT! (5 blocks to Union Square, straight down Van Ness to Fisherman's Wharf, walk to Little Osaka) It's not California glossy style, but it has character and is more on the real side. I would definitely stay here again.","Jun 16, 2005","0","0",6,4,1,4,1,5,1,"3","$204"
"hotel_134","hotel_3410","Old Lady needs a facelift, but she ain't that bad Stayed at the Cathedral Hill, Feb 27-March 5. This old lady needs a facelift but overall it was not a bad place. She is ugly compared to the great architecture SF has to offer. Good location for the Civic Center/ Opera/Symphony. Only about 4 blocks to the California Cable Car terminus. Hotel food was basic hotel food...but being SF, dining out is part of the whole SF experience. Single women travelers may want to use caution as it is on the edge of the Tenderloin area, but Van Ness is a busy avenue. I was there during the week and it was quiet, but I did notice that on Friday more people coming for weekend getaways.

Our rooms were fine, clean, not noisy and room service was good. The kids adored the outdoor heated pool - it's circular, as warm as a luke warm bath and goes from 3' to 8'. The shallow end is roped off. Hotel location is great - there are a few decent sandwich bars directly opposite the hotel where we bought snacks, breakfast and public transportation stops right outside the door.

"hotel_136","hotel_6484","A great little gem for a fantastic price. Every December I meet friends for a girls' weekend in San Francisco. We usually get rooms on Priceline, but this year decided that location took precedence and looked for a good rate on a hotel near Union Square. We found a wonderful rate through hotels.com for the Serrano Hotel, which is a Kimpton property. Knowing Kimpton's reputation and noting the fantastic location we decided to give the hotel a try and are we glad we did!Some reviews here suggest that the area is too criminal or threatening, esp. for women traveling by themselves, but we came and went after dark and never once felt threatened or afraid. We weren't even nervous. The Hilton and Nikko hotel are right around the corner and walking to and from Union Square along O'farrell is absolutely fine. Yes, you might be asked for change by someone along the way, but that can happen on almost any street downtown.The hotel itself was an easy walk from the BART station on Powell. The lobby is very cute and the decor for Christmas cheery. At the front desk, play a hand of blackjack with the clerk and if you win, you pick from a list of daily prizes (we got a bottle of wine delivered to the room). If you lose, donate to their animal charity. Check-in was fast. The elevators are tiny and on the slow side, but not annoyingly so. We had rooms with two doubles. The rooms are very small, but nicely decorated. Love the ipod docking alarm clock/radio, the down comforters and comfy beds. The flat panel TV was a nice touch also. The closet had ample room with iron/ironing board, plenty of hangers and cheetah-print robes for guest use. The bathroom again, was very tiny but well-stocked with Aveda bath amenities (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and two kinds of soap). I love not having to pack extra toiletries, so having nice products is a big plus. There is no counter space to speak of, but there is a narrow shelf running the length of the mirror. Enough room for toothbrushes, etc. The shower is really high on the wall, perfect for tall people. The water pressure is fine. The biggest surprise for us was the absence of street noise. Our room faced O'Farrell St. and we expected it to be loud, but we remarked every morning how quiet it had been the night before. I think we're used to putting up with noisy SF streets, so it was an unexpected surprise to have such quiet nights.We did not eat at the restaurant but did attend the wine reception one afternoon. For 1 hour each afternoon, there is a wine reception in the lobby with a choice of house red or white wine. Check out a board game from the many choices at the front desk and relax. It's a lot of fun and a good time to meet other guests. There is also coffee and tea available every morning.The staff was always friendly and helpful. Everytime we walked in the doors, there was a welcome back. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Serrano and would go back in an instant. The location can't be beat, the staff friendly and the beds comfy.","Dec 16, 2008","0","0",6,5,6,5,5,6,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_2852","Our Favorite Hotel in San Francisco! Visited San Fran in August '08 then husband and I returned to Serrano for anniversary getaway during Thanksgiving weekend. Can't wait to visit again!Love most everything about this boutique-style hotel. Friendly, accommodating, convenient, great rooms. Walking distance from main tourist attractions and popular restaurants. Love the comfortable bed and clean, quiet rooms. If you can, book an Executive King suite. Bathrooms are huge! I counted 7 shower heads in our shower and it even had a TV! Spacious room, 2 TV's, bed separated from living area by curtain, large sofa pullout in living area. Internet available in hotel room and lobby.Coffee and tea available free in lobby in morning. Wine hour late afternoon. Doorman great with directions. Play a quick game of blackjack when you check in and you might get a free continental breakfast. Pet friendly, restaurant on site but lots of restaurants within walking distance not to be missed.They include Taylor Street Cafe and Doris' for breakfast. Trust me. They're good and reasonable. Expect about a 45 min wait at Doris', worth it.Try Max's for dinner. Also Daily Grill is close. Lots of sushi and Indian eateries nearby. Didn't try them, maybe next trip. A few things I think could be improved. Although they offer coffee in lobby, would like a small pot in room, just to get you off the dime while you're waking up. They need a brand of soap that lasts longer. Parking is expensive, valet service about $45 a day. You don't need a car plus there's nowhere to park in city.About the area, yes, there are a lot of homeless. There are also a lot of tourists. This hotel is on fringe of Tenderloin district but just use common sense and you should be fine. It's also extremely close to one of the main cable car stations, Union Square, shopping, food, the Westfield Mall (love the food court there). And no big hills to negotiate. Serrano is just across from the Hilton so there are always plenty of taxis nearby.Overall, where we stay is a big part of the success of our trips. In this case, the Serrano is our first choice. Good value, walking distance to the main sites, quiet and clean rooms and friendly staff. Although it doesn't have the fancy amenities of luxury hotels it has everything you need in this great city. Check rates on Travelzoo and the hotel website.Happy Travels!","Dec 4, 2008","0","0",6,6,5,6,5,6,5,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_3825","Serrano - a convenient haven. The Serrano in San Francisco is a superb hotel - we stayed 4 nights from 8th Nov 2008 and loved it. The location is very convenient for all the tourist things - Union Sq, cable car, Golden Gate(by bus from outside the hotel), China town. Also the drop off point for car rentals is just opposite. The Tenderloin is nearby and I was concerned about that but no worries we did not feel at all threatened. The staff were very friendly and helpful - when we checked in we were given a small room - perfectly adequate and comfortable except that we had been travelling for 3 weeks and had 4 large pieces of luggage. When I spoke to the receptionist about this he immediately got us a bigger room and an upgrade and threw in a complimentary breakfast- excellent service. The beds are the most comfortable ever but I would agree with a past review that the shower over the bath is dangerous - last year in a Spanish hotel in the same cicumstances my husband slipped and broke 2 ribs!! There is a free wine reception each night and this is a wonderful idea as it gives an opportunity for socialising with other guests. My only other criticism is that there is no coffee maker in the room. We arrived about noon having been driving for 4 hours and were gasping for a coffee but had to go out to find a coffee shop. Coffee is available in the lobby in the morning up until about 10 0'clock but not thereafter. In conclusion I would compliment the hotel on the friendliness of all the staff and their willingness to offer assistance and advice.","Nov 17, 2008","2","2",6,6,6,6,6,6,4,"4","$326"

I came home and ordered Frette linens and am trying to find the same bed (for cheaper then you can buy it from them.)A couple of downsides.. all of the staff seemed like they could have cared less if you were there or not. We were hoping for al least some smiles and pleasant conversation when we checked in. You also have no coffeemake in the room and have to go downstairs in the morning for a cup (not a pot). I wanted some tea late at night and was told I couldn't get any. Also the tub/shower combo... the tub is slpoed on both sides towards the middle, making it VERY difficult to stand in taking a shower without falling.. a little dangerous if you ask me.

Complimentary wine fit the experience and gave a great reason to mingle in the cozy lobby.The location of the hotel really couldn't have been better in my opinion. Taking the front desk's advice, take an EASY walk toward Market and you've got everything you need from shopping/transportation/restaurants at your disposal.As far as the rooms, we had to check in early due to the fact we were coming from another hotel (the Serrano didn't have availability our first night).

The door man greeted us each day by name and the concierge was most helpful in giving us information regarding city. The hotel is centrally located to Union square which makes catching the trolley to all other sites (i.e. China town, Fisherman's Wharf) easy, however, if you go 1 block down and to the east of the hotel you will be overcome by Homeless people. This made me feel extremely uncomfortable and is definetely something I'm not accustomed to seeing while on vacation. The rooms are really small. As my husband said, I can't even change my mind in this room let alone my clothes. And the closet smelled bad. We stayed 3 nights and I have to confess that I was excited to move on to our next hotel.

"hotel_136","hotel_9699","Close to Cable Car and Shopping This hotel is ok to stay at when visiting San Francisco. It is only 5 minutes away from the Powell cable car station (by foot) and also very close to Union Square (great shopping, Saks, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, plenty of well-known brands). 5 Starbucks in walking distance. The rooms, at least the one I stayed in, was fairly small, with a very modern TV. The room was ok, nothing outstanding. Donwside: You cannot open the window, the air is quite stuffy and the windows are steamed up from the outside, not possible to get a great view over San Francisco. They do wine-tastings in the entrance hall. The staff was helpful but not over-friendly. The waiters in the breakfast room struggled with English. For breakfast I expected more, no buffet or anything. The bagel I had was rather plain. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice though, Asian-style cuisine with very friendly and polite staff. The food was good. The staff made the dining worthwhile, you felt very welcome. The doorman said not to walk to the direction away from the Hilton (you can see the Hilton from the serrano Hotel), apparently not a nice area.

"hotel_136","hotel_6953","Great Hotel! Aug 9-10 My husband and I decided to get a jump start on our 5 year wedding anniversary, (08-16-03), by staying at SF for one night. We are SPG members and enjoy staying at Le Meridien and Westin Hotels. This was our first time at a Kimpton Hotel and the Serrano made a lasting impression. From the doorman to reception personnel, it seems as though everyone just returned from a weekend long customer service training. Smiles, how are you doing, and may I help you? from everyone. After reading many positive reviews, I found the Asst GM, Antonio Flores. I decided to confirm our stay by emailing him directly and informing him of our special occassion. The only expectation I had was for a king size bed and perhaps some chocolate on the pillows. Boy, was I surprised. Upon opening the door, we saw a small platter of strawberries and chilled champagne. The room was very nice and spacious with a jacuzzi (executive king room). Our plans were to go shopping in Union, eat at a nice restaurant (Ana Mandara) and enjoy the night life of SF. We only completed the first two and enjoy the room instead of night life. We would stay at this hotel again, not because of Mr. Flores recognized our special occassion and went the extra mile, but the overall service from staff. The hotel itself was very nice, of course, cozy and elegant. For future SF getaways, we would stay here versus our usual hotels. Location was great, two blocks from Union Square.

"hotel_136","hotel_6558","Incredible Stay I'm usually very cynical about hotels and don't typically write to praise a hotel. This hotel breaks the mold and has impressed me to the point of writing a positive review.The staff was incredibly friendly and professional: from the concierge acknowledgment to us as we walked in to the bellman remembering our names throughout the entire stay...we truly felt important. The rooms were very clean with plenty of room and plenty of amenities. The staff was incredibly helpful with great food recommendations that were both affordable and close. They also were helpful in general San Francisco information.This hotel bumps up against the tenderloin area, but I would never have guessed that there was ever any danger. My wife and i never once felt that we were in a threatening or uncomfortable situation concerning our safety.My only complaint with the hotel is minor in that the toilet seat would not stay up as I tried to use the restroom...my wife found this trick useful :).The Serrano Hotel was so good that my wife and I decided to call and book another Kimpton hotel when we return to San Francisco...We booked the Prescott Hotel. Nothing but the highest praises for the Serrano Hotel, the staff, and the Kimpton properties.","Aug 20, 2008","0","0",6,6,5,6,6,6,4,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_8847","Very Cool I was a little nervous since my husband was convinced the Hotel would be in the Tenderloin and I was trying to point out that it was close to Union Square. When we pulled up in the taxi the Doorman grabbed our suitcase - asked us our name and escorted us to the front desk. The service was delightful and we were 2 little blocks from Union Square - Ha Ha! So it is a perfect location. It has a very European feel to it and the guests were mostly European. They have a game theme - there are games to play in the lobby + a check-in game which I missed. And they have toys to play with in the room -- cute. We were very satisfied with our stay and we would stay there again.","Aug 19, 2008","0","0",5,5,6,6,6,1,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_3840","Excellent hotel On our recent visit to the Bay area, we decided to try a different hotel every night. I'm partially glad we did this but also wish we had our complete stay at this excellent hotel.We stayed at The Fairmont and upgraded to a Tower Signature Suite, we had a King Executive Room at the Hotel Rex and an upgraded room at Serrano. By far, we enjoyed the Serrano the most. Mr. Antonio Flores and the rest of the excellent staff made our stay much nicer with his personalized service.Our arrival was early, nonetheless, our room was thankfully available. All requested amenities were honored, such as an upper floor with a view, feather pillows, etc. Mr. Flores made sure that there was a personalized welcome item, based on a discussion I'd had with him via email. Nobody else givers that level of service!The hotel is on the cusp of the Tenderloin district but we had no issues and quickly learned to avoid walking in that direction. I felt completely safe in the immediate area around and within the hotel and in the direction of Union Square. The hotel is an easy walk to excellent shopping and transportation (giving easy access to the entire city). I was a bit surprised at the relative paucity of fine dining in the entire area, but this is no reflection on the hotel (and maybe I just didn't wander to the right spots).Our room was large and the bathroom, with jacuzzi, had the best shower of all three hotels. I believe that this was the hotel that had Aveeda bath products, my personal favorite. Our room was clean, had free Internet access, and well lit. Emergency routes were well-marked. The only fault I could come up with is that it's impossible to get to the bathroom if the sofa bed is extended. But, being part acrobat, I was able to get there without waking my family.The concierge was most helpful in arranging a last minute tour for us and ensured that it all went smoothly. He had great suggestions. I really can't say too may good things about this facility and, even without considering the most reasonable room rate, Serrano beat out its competitors...hands down, including the upgraded Fairmont room.I heartily recommend this hotel, regardless of travel budget. A final special thanks again to Mr. Flores.","Aug 17, 2008","0","0",6,6,5,6,6,6,6,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_6709","Consistently Kimpton I often stay at Kimpton Hotels for work, but this week visited the Serrano in San Francisco for fun. What I really like about this chain is that the quality and little perks are consistent. I know they'll have good coffee in the lobby every morning and the New York Times. The wine in the afternoon is such a nice bonus. My room in SF was spotless, as always. The sheets are always crisp and I love the feather pillows of assorted sizes. One quirk that it might be time to address is the cheesy robes that look like they came out of a 70s bachelor pad. Leopard print terry is not tasteful. Let's think about some white waffle weave spa robes. Additionally, I've been pretty impressed with the frequent traveller program. I've been consistently upgraded at almost every stay. Other programs say they'll do that but they never seem to deliver. If I had one gripe it's the astronomical parking fees. $40, even for SF is excessive and seems wrong when directly across the street the garage is charging $10 less. It sends the a nickel-and-diming message to guest and it really stands out since so much is on the mark.","Aug 17, 2008","0","0",4,5,6,6,6,5,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_3607","Good hotel for the adventuresome The Serrano is a lovely old hotel billed as being in the theatre district of San Francisco. The hotel itself was very nice. Interesting old world feel to the lobby. Very helpful staff. Extremely spacious rooms. Nice added touch is the afternoon wine tasting. However, the location, while only 3 blocks from Union Square, appeared to be a little iffy. The theatres I saw were a couple of blocks away and appeared dark. Maybe the area is better when shows are playing.The other downside was the restaurant at breakfast. It didn't open until 8 am on the weekends. Not good for a group trying to catch a tour bus at 8:15! The one day we were able to eat there, it was extremely slow with one waitress constantly telling us I'm not the only server whenever we would ask for something. Breakfast food was average at best.Overall, it was a good hotel with a spacious room and very comfortable bed. Pluses do outweigh the minuses.","Aug 6, 2008","0","0",4,5,3,4,5,5,5,"4","$326"

I emailed Mr. Antonio Flores before our trip, and he was helpful in accommodating our late check-out request. Check-in was fast and professional (no mention of the priceline reservation).Here are the pluses and minuses of our room:+ Funky decor (Kimpton hotels aren't cookie cutter hotels, that's for sure! This Kimpton is fun, although it may not suit all tastes).+ Super Comfy Bed (this is really important to me).+ Impeccably clean (the room was spotless)+ Evening wine/beer reception in lobby (we only made one of these, but it was fun)+ Super helpful and friendly staff- Small rooms. (This is an old building, so space is tight.

"hotel_136","hotel_2179","Cheap and average I was on 3 day break from London to see friends in San Francisco. This hotel was cheap being booked through Kimpton's website, with a discount that you get if you subscribe to their in-touch programme (which is free). The cost was only about 拢60 per night and for that then you really don't get the right to complain about much.The room was fine although on the small side and a little noisy near the elevator and on a low level (I had requested the opposite but the hotel was full). Reasonably clean although the bathroom was tiny and I had to angle my legs to sit on the toilet because the bath was too close on one side.The air con outlet made a strange rattling noise which was bothersome.As a base to go out and party though it's fine, the location is good enough and despite the minor issues this place does represent good value and I would stay here again.","Aug 3, 2008","1","1",6,3,3,4,4,1,5,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_7532","Not one of Kimpton's best... Kimpton has a reputation for having beautiful, boutique-style hotels that offer exceptional service. The Serrano Hotel in San Francisco was a disappointment. The location is fantastic in the most walkable city in America. We were able to get to all modes of transportation easily, great shopping was nearby, and great restaurants were convenient. But the hotel is not run like a typical Kimpton.Be prepared...because it is in downtown, the spaces in the hotel feel squeezed. The rooms are small. I stayed in a double-double with my husband, two kids, and a dog, luckily for just one night. Afterwards, I stayed in a queen room, corner of the building, and the room felt perfect for one person. Kimpton is supposed to be pet friendly. Though my dog was allowed, no special attention was given, as occurs at other Kimptons. Also, next time I go to San Fran with a pet, I need to choose a place that has some grass/plants around so he can do his business!Except for the doormen, all the staff assisted us with a smile. However, they had odd policies. Kimpton places a placard in the bathrooms to let you know what they can provide in case you forgot something. But when my friend mentioned she needed a toothbrush (something the placard says the hotel will provide free), she was told to get one from the honor bar! At $3.00. The hotel provides room service, but don't plan on using it early in the morning on the weekend. We had an 8 am bus to catch, and room service was not available until 8 oclock that morning. Unfortunately, I hadn't seen the fine print on the order form and was counting on a 7 am meal from the hotel. I had to give my money to the Starbucks in the hotel across the street instead.My complaints are all relatively small, but when you expect exceptional service and don't experience it, then the interpretation is disappointing. Won't stay there again...sorry, Serrano.","Jul 26, 2008","2","0",3,4,5,5,6,3,3,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_8370","Nice boutique hotel, would stay here again I won this hotel through Priceline, and felt we got a great deal for the price. The hotel is located right next to the Tenderloin, which leads to some questionable activities if you walk two blocks in the wrong direction, but it is also really close to all the great shopping and eats in Union Square. Since we were pretty familiar with the area, we knew where to walk and where to avoid, so the location was good for what we wanted to do. Parking here is indeed pricey, but there are two parking garages next to the hotel that offer overnight parking for $30. We've stayed in a couple of Kimpton properties before that were more contemporary and modern, but we liked the feel of this hotel nonetheless. The rooms are cozy (which is the case in most hotels here in SF) but clean and well furnished. We liked the wine and beer tasting in the lobby between 5-6pm, even if our anti-social selves just used it to take some free wine up to our room! Only downside was when we called the front desk to ask for some toothbrushes/toothpaste (yup, we are the travelers that forgot) and after waiting in our rooms for half an hour, finally went downstairs to get it. Apparently the front desk person forgot to send it up - he did apologize, and then informed us he only had toothbrushes, no paste. We were told we could walk down to the corner market and pick up some. This wasn't a big deal, but since the room has signs that clearly state a list of complementary items they had available for us forgetful travelers (and toothpaste was one of them), I thought it was a bit discouraging.Overall, I thought this was a nice hotel with a decent location.

From the doorman, front desk staff, housekeeping and maintenance staff we were always greet you with a hello.

We received our room at a rate of $99 (before taxes of course), which we received when we used the hotel website.For our purposes, it was my first time in SF and my boyfriend's 15th, we were total tourists. So this hotel was in a good location. I did find out when we went out one night, that you have to watch out which streets you go down b/c the hotel is located near the tenderloin district, but I have to do that in NYC, so it wasn't a big deal and we had no problems.We liked that we could get coffee in the morning in the Lobby as well as newspapers. Also, there is an afternoon wine and beer hour that is free to guests.

"hotel_136","hotel_7916","Did not meet expectations ...... CONS - Let's just start off with the CONS so you don't waste your time researching for the Serrano HotelFirst, let me start off with the hotel rates. I saw the rates for $104.88 per night on travelocity, so I decided to book via the hotel website itself incase i wanted to cancel for a better rate if available at the Westin. When I called in to request for a rate, they gave me $140+. I then asked why it was so high compared to what I saw on travelocity, and they put me on hold for a quick minute and then responded with we will match that. I think that alone is very decieving as they were able to knock off $40 per night for us within 1 min.Second - although you see all the reviews of this location being in a convenient spot, at night, this street is pretty quiet and so is the intersection where the Hilton is located. There also seems to be more homeless people loitering around this area compared to others. Third - This hotel will charge you $50 (believe this is some insurance charge) each night you stay on top of the room rate. This will be deducted from your form of payment and supposedly will be returned back to your account. Either right after check out or 48 hours after check out. Which is fine if they actually return the money back to you. Fourth - When my boyfriend and I checked in, the person at the front desk gave us two key cards that did not even work for our hotel room PLUS charged us TWICE for our stay and didn't even acknowledge what he did. My boyfriend didn't know either until he looked at his online statement - thankfully for that. When we notified the front desk of this situation, all they did was apologize and contacted their accounting dept who unfortunately told us they couldn't even do anything. So I stepped in and asked, if you are going to return our $50 insurance charge per night upon our check out, why can't you return the second charge as this is not a valid charge? They could not even give me an answer nor did they try to resolve it. So finally, the next front desk person we spoke with said she will try the accounting dept. again and give us a call the following business day, Monday (we left on a friday). At this point - it is now Thursday, no refund was made nor did they even bother contacting us. I believe they are waiting and expecting us to dispute the charge from the bank which is completely insane and the transaction and investigation for the dispute will take weeks compared to just a refund from the hotel itself - we have already notified them of this delay and nothing has been done. This amount was a lot too and he had used his debit card. Fifth - They give you keys for the bar which is located in the tv shelf. They tell you the keys are for the bar and make it sound like anything from the bar is complimentary. I first thought the drinks/snacks were complimentary but they don't mention you have to pay for everything until you ask - nor do they leave a sign anywhere about it compared the other hotels I've stayed at. Conclusion - Hotel was really small, pictures of the hotel gave a much bigger and nicer impression of the hotel until we walked in it. The next time I visit, I think I will stay at the Westin and pay 50 dollars more for just the convenience, safety, security, bigger room and a staff who can provide even an ounce of satisfaction to their guests. PROSDoormen were nice and rooms were clean.Please find a hotel that's either by Fisherman's Wharf or right next to the Union Square park. Spending that extra money per night is worth it.","Jun 6, 2008","4","1",3,4,3,5,3,4,1,"4","$326"

I'm so glad that our first two choices were booked because our misfortune led us to my favourite hotel, hands down! First off, the price was moderate considering how expensive boutique hotels in Union Square are. Then we had the option to upgrade our room to a king sized suite for only $49 extra/night. It was well worth it. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was to die for. The decor of the bedroom was fabulously fun and chic without being pretentious. In fact, I loved the room so much that I was trying to cancel some of the activities I had planned just so I could spend more time lounging in our amazing room! Also, the bed was incredibly comfortable. In addition to all this, the hotel rooms and amenities were well thought out and I found myself discovering little details that made my stay even more enjoyable (board games and such).The decor in the lobby and elevators is a lovely introduction to the hotel and the front desk personnel and door men are very helpful (Pam in particular at the front desk made my trip much easier).Anyways, I could make this already long and glowing review even longer because I loved the Serrano so much but I'll stop here and urge people reading this to book a room here ASAP!

The hotel is lovely, the lobby great, the free wine - a nice perk, the staff, all of them, 100% fantastic.We suffered no problems with noise. The panhandlers seem a common feature of SF and none were aggressive. To be honest, all my memories of the panhandlers are of charming people trying to charm a few cents off you (I went outside for smokes frequently so met a fair few of them lol)The only thing I'd say is that if I'd paid rack rates for the same Queen room I'd have been very miffed at $299 - the room was as small as could be. It was lovely, and worked well, but put it this way, if you have your TV cabinet doors extended, you can't get from one side of the bed to the other. Not a problem, but not worth 300 bucks in my mind. Saying that - it probably is for central SF.I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel if space is not an issue. Oh - free Internet, which is essential for us as we are travelling extensively.We have now moved to the Cathedral Hill Hotel - which has rack rates at the same as the Hotwire rates for the Serrano - none of the charm but the room is twice the size. This counts a lot for us as we are here for 5 nights. But put it this way, we'd have stayed at the Serrano if we could have secured more nights at the same rate.Book with confidence!

For the most part, we really enjoyed our stay. We got in late Saturday night and were upgraded to a suite, which was an unexpected surprise. The hotel was beautiful, had great detail, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The one small problem we had was that the walls are very thin. We often heard doors slamming, and people's conversations, and that was a bit annoying. In addition, there were $20/night in taxes, and the parking was $40/night! There is a safe place to park (I was worried it might not be as safe to not use the hotel's parking) on Taylor right next to the hotel - only $24/night.

Service was good: efficient and friendly. The room wasn't huge, but more than adequate. Good shower, nice amenities, and - most importantly - a great bed. The leopard-print bathrobes are hilarious (in a good way). No problems with noise, inside or outside the hotel. On the downside windows don't open, which can create a bit of a stuffy atmosphere. Unfortunately far too many hotels have this issue. In short, an excellent place to stay if you're visiting SF. The odd interior won me over in the end; it beats the cookie-cutter hotel average.

The hotel was close to Union Square (within walking distance), the BART station and the Powell St cable car line. Lots of dining locations to choose from. If you take the BART from the SF Airport - take Powell St north to O'Farrell and head west to Taylor St. We made the mistake of heading east from the BART and walked through the Tenderloin District - not the nicest area, lots of homeless people. All in all, a good place to stay - love the evening wine service in the lobby and the board games available for playing anytime. Take the cable car to the wharf - about 2 mile walk - but it actually takes awhile with the steep hills.","Apr 15, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,4,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_2922","Great Start!!! Would go again..... Great start to our honeymoon, were a little worried reading some reviews going on about the area. We had no problems, Yes you might see the odd weirdo but lets face it you can see them anywhere. The hotel was more than expected, the room was very clean and comfortable, and as it was our honeymoon we had asked for a high room and the hotel obliged by giving us a room on the top floor 17th or something like that. The location is handy for everything (Dollar rent a car is right round the corner) and if travelling to San Fran again I would stay in this hotel again.

The Serrano sounded so good on Tripadvisor and it lived up to its reputation.The room was absolutely beautiful, extremely comfortable and clean. In reviews it was said that the rooms were small but we found it adequate and spaceous for our needs. The staff were extremely friendly and it was great to come back to the hotel after a day of sightseeing and be greeted with smiles and the use of your name.

"hotel_136","hotel_7020","Great Location--Even Better Bed The Serrano is part of the Kimpton boutique chain. All related hotels host evening wine/beer hours in the lobby, which is a very nice perk.Check-in was unbelievably smooth. I had been staying at another Kimpton (Hotel Triton) earlier in the week and checked out at noon before walking the 1/3 mile to the Serrano. I fully expected to not be able to check in, but I had hoped to at least leave my luggage before heading out again. Much to my surprise, I was greeted warmly and given my preferred room immediately.My room was on the 12th floor and had a so-so view east of Union Square. My room was wonderful--decadently comfortable queen sized bed, sufficent armoire and tv, and decent bathroom with bath/shower combo and Aveda products. The rooms aren't large, but you are hard-pressed to find large rooms in the middle of San Francisco. The room was spotless and was immaculately tended to each morning by housekeeping.I'm a member of the loyalty program with Kimpton, which includes a gift upon each arrival. When I arrived to my room, I found a 16 oz. bottle of spring water and a small box of Napa-produced truffles. Very nice touch.The concierge assisted me twice--once to arrange shuttle transportation to the airport and another time to make reservations for my party at a nearby restaurant. Each time, Chad was most gracious and helpful.My only complaint was with room-service from the adjacent restaurant (Ponzu). On my last morning there, I ordered breakfast and was told delivery would take place within 30 minutes. After 55 minutes, I called to inquire about the order since my shuttle was due to pick me up in 45 minutes. I was told that the kitchen was backed up and my order would not be ready for at least another 25 minutes. I emphasized that I had been conveyed different information when I placed the order and that I would need to cancel the order due to my shuttle. Within 5 minutes, I had a knock at the door and my breakfast was ushered into the room. The restaurant manager had delivered it and then told me it was on the house. In spite of the frustration of waiting, I felt it had been handled very well.One final note: many reviewers have commented/complained about the large number of transients in the area. San Francisco is a large city and the Serrano Hotel is located in the middle of it all. Unfortunately, homelessness is a very sad reality of city life in the United States. I did not encounter one hostile transient during my entire stay. I felt completely safe and comfortable (and spent much of my time alone). Homelessness makes much of us uncomfortable--and it should. But it is not a threatening issue that should dissuade visitors from staying in the Union Square area.It's hard to go wrong with a Kimpton property.","Apr 1, 2008","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"

The room was on the small side, but had lovely decor, the beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. Close to Powell St and Union Square.

I checked in very late on a Sunday night, curb service was outstanding and front desk was efficient checking in (and out.)Only problems were food related: no coffee in room. The service at Ponzu restaurant for breakfast was actually hostile, although we were able to go out into the lobby for the free coffee and bring it back into the Ponzu to drink. Bar is fine in the evening but closes early.

"hotel_136","hotel_7558","Unique decor, nice service good location I stay at Kimpton Hotels whenever I can. First because they are pet friendly and I often bring my small dog and second you can always rely on them to be interesting, well appointed and comfortable. I found the Serrano to be no different. An older building it is attractive and has a decor that is unique. The rooms are slightly on the small side, but the beds are comfortable, there is good water pressure and they are are attractively decorated. The toiletries are nice and the rooms are always clean. The staffs are always friendly and helpful and the concierage service extraordinary. As per a previous reviewer I too have found that as Kimpton loyalty member, the Serrano does not always provide the amenities the you are supposed to get, but that said a bottle of warm water and a biscotti (that seems to be the usual for me)is really not missed. But if say you are going to provide something you should.I would definately stay at the Serrano again, in fact I am booked for this upcoming weekend. As far as the location is concerned I never felt unsafe and it is close to Union Square and Powell Street","Feb 28, 2008","0","0",6,6,5,6,6,6,6,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_2008","Good (not great) hotel if you can catch a deal on Priceline First, let me say that overall, this was a good hotel. The room was cute. It was in a good location and I would stay here again (if I can get it for $80 on Priceline, but I would never pay $200 for the room that we got). Okay, so the hotel's website is pretty misleading. Let's just say that the hotel hired an excellent photographer. The lobby and rooms look many times larger than the actual size. We just decided to pretend that our room was a bedroom, not an actual hotel room and it felt a little better. There was just enough space to walk around the bed and that was it. That said, the room was cute, very cozy and comfortable. Things weren't quite as nice as the pictures - the bedskirt was pretty rumpled and the windows were pretty dirty - but it wasn't horribly objectionable, just not what I had been expecting. Service wise, it was mixed. We arrived early, around 11 a.m., and we were able to check in at arrival and were given a room on the top (17th) floor. Yay! However, strangely, later in the day when we were returning from shopping we saw some sort of employee exiting our room. Seemed kind of wierd considering we were already checked in and it wasn't really time to start cleaning the room. We called and then went to the front desk to try to figure out what was going on. They kind of blew us off, but eventually decided that it was somebody checking the minbar. Hmm...that's the first time, I've seen that, but whatever. Also, unlike other reviewers, nobody happily greeted us upon entrance and exit. Not a big deal, but I think we were expecting a bit more of a pampering atmosphere, and it was more like self serve. In regards to location, it was conveniently located close to shopping and the BART and MUNI. That was very nice and worth quite a bit. As others have said there is a major homeless problem in the area. Normally, I can just ignore them and keep walking but this past trip was a different experience entirely. I was followed, called a [--] and had objects thrown at me. Not entirely pleasant, but I just tried to brush it off. Afterall, it makes a good story. And a side note, in regards to the oft mentioned Dottie's Tru Blue Cafe, which is about a block from the hotel. So NOT worth it. We waited in line for about an hour and a half for breakfast. The experience was interesting I guess...I mean how often do you get to watch crack heads pacing back and forth in front of you or see a drug deal on the corner? The food was good, but not great and definitely not worth the wait. Personally, I would have been just as happy with a muffin from Starbucks.","Feb 21, 2008","2","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_5133","Tres Boutique When proffered about a hotel, boutique usually means old, small and dated. That pretty much sums up the Serrano. Add to that the neighborhood where homeless people play dice just outside the hotel entrance, and you get a less than satisfactory stay for the price.It is not a bad hotel really, but I would definitely not recommend it either. If this were a discount hotel, I would say forgive the problems and give it a try. The beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly. It is certainly adequate. It is just far from luxurious.If you are from Europe, you will be very satisfied with the room sizes. If you are used to U.S. hotel room sizes, you will be extremely disappointed. The bathroom was so small, I kept bumping my head and other body parts just turning around in it. I would complain about the size of the bedroom except that I visited a different room that a collegue was staying in and in comparison to his my room was downright spacious.They have free internet access, which is wonderful. However, despite supposedly being high speed, the speed I got was far closer to dial up. The TV was good however. They actually had quite a few channels.This has been a somewhat rambling review. The bottom line is that at the regular price, this is not the hotel for you. The rooms are clean but small and the location is on the edge of a very bad section of town. If you somehow get a bargain discount, it might be worth it. Just go into it with an open eye.","Feb 20, 2008","1","1",2,3,2,5,5,5,3,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_1606","Repeat customer disappointed this time... Stay Monday, Feb. 4 - Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2008This was my fourth time staying at the Serrano (3 times in 2007, 1st time in 2008). We have kept coming back because the experience is fun, and because as return stayers there is such a nice welcome back. Not this time...The bellman is great, friendly, he knows who you are just by teling him where you are coming from. At check-in we were asked if this was our first time staying at the hotel. I told the man that this was our 4th time, and asked if our Kimpton In-Touch loyalty number was attached to our reservation in the computer (I thought maybe it was not showing up in the computer that we were return customers because the loyalty number was not attached to the reservation). He said that our loyalty number was attached to the reservation.We proceeded to the room. In the past, there has always been a nice note and some treats (cookies, drinks, small bottle of wine) in the room welcoming us back as loyal, returning guests. There was nothing there. I thought maybe something would be coming later. Nope...nothing. So, again, I thought maybe our number is really not attached to our reservation. The following morning I went to the front desk and let them know that we usually have a little something waiting in our room as in-touch loyalty members, and nothing was there, so I just wanted to double check that the loyalty number was in the computer. The woman checked and just simply said Yes, it's there. I guess I have been spoiled, but I was disappointed that there was nothing waiting for us, and no special welcoming feel this time. We were going to head out for the day (around 8 am) and got some change from the front desk. The woman then said she would try to send up something for us, inquired where we were from, made small talk. I thought that was nice and we would have something when we get back. Nope! When we returned, the room was clean, but no goodies were there.Got back around 2 pm and took a nap. Was awoken with a knock at the door at around 4 pm. A woman handed me a bottle of water and a little box with 2 chocolates...not exactly the same touch as before.At check-out the next morning, the same woman at the front desk who the previous day looked in the computer for our loyalty number asked me if I wanted to sign up to join Kimpton In-Touch. I told her we are already members, is the number not there? (She just checked on this for me the day before) She said, oh yes, the number is here. She asked us if we have stayed at the hotel before. I told her this was our 4th visit. The hotel was not busy at all, so I was confused as to how so many staff members at the front desk didn't have a clue about anything.I booked the reservation though the Kimpton website after logging in with my loyalty number, so I was expecting to receive all the perks that go along with that. Instead, I felt like we were treated as if we booked through Priceline or something (I should have done that--I would have gotten a better deal, and the same service).I am normally not a complainer--but I definitely feel like the experience for the return customer is different now than it was in the past. I think the front desk needs some help. There are lots of hotels in SF Union Square and the reason I would return to the Serrano was consistent service where I felt they recognized repeat customers. Even with me giving them many hints, they still did not get it. I was not impressed this time, and I think it is time to try some different hotels when we go to SF.","Feb 7, 2008","5","1",3,4,5,4,3,3,4,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_2329","A Windy Long Weekend in San Fran My wife and I stayed four nights at the Serrano Hotel in San Francisco from January 3 to 7, 2008. We had never stayed at the Serrano Hotel before, but since it is part of the Kimpton boutique hotel chain that my wife and I enjoy, we thought that we'd give it a try. I booked our King Deluxe room via the Kimpton website for $126 per night (plus tax), a rate that I thought was very reasonable for downtown San Francisco.We arrived Thursday night at 10 pm during the worst winter storm of the season (our flight from Canada was delayed 3 hours due to the storm conditions in San Francisco). Unfortunately, after a long trip getting to San Francisco, we did not get the warm Serrano Hotel welcome advertised on many web pages and websites. Don't get me wrong, everyone was decent to us, but there was no offer of a game of 21 to upgrade our room (as mentioned in the bedside book in our room), and the concierge desk person was less than enthusiastic when I asked about any half-decent places to eat on a late Thursday evening in the immediate area (we had missed dinner due to the flight delay).Speaking of the immediate area around the Serrano Hotel, it is less than upscale. In fact, the neighbourhood, despite being only two blocks from Union Square and kitty-korner to the San Francisco Hilton, is what one might call Transitional. That is, by day the neighbourhood is okay, but come darkness, the streets are taken over by homeless people and panhandlers. Furthermore, the streets in the area are very dark, lacking sufficient municipal street lighting. Some people may find the idea of walking alone at night too scary to try...As for the Serrano Hotel itself, it is a three star property (based on the five star scale). Some websites refer to it as a four star property, but it is not! The lobby is nice and clean, with a feeling of the roaring 20s. Our room, a King Deluxe, was also clean and contained the blessed Kimpton King Size bed (there are no Tall Rooms at the Serrano Hotel). As always, we had excellent sleeps in the Kimpton bed, but our room was extremely small with a very plain and basic bathroom. We can only hope that one-day the Kimpton people will hear about flat screen Plasma and LCD television, and start installing 42 inch sets into their hotel rooms instead of the small 20 year old television sets they currently utilize. Other than our first night when we enquired about a local place to eat, we found the staff to be quite friendly, with many staff members going out of their way to say hello to us or to ask if we needed help with anything. The various concierge staff were excellent at arranging dinner reservations and taxis for us, while the cleaning staff did an excellent job of keeping our room clean and tidy.Overall, we rate our Serrano Hotel experience as okay, but not quite what we have come to expect from Kimpton properties. If one must stay in the Union Square area, then the Sir Francis Drake, also a Kimpton property, would be a much better choice. But our favorite Kimpton San Francisco area hotel remains The Argonaut Hotel at the corner of Jefferson and Hyde on Fisherman's Wharf. For just a few dollars more, The Argonaut Hotel is in a far superior class to the Serrano Hotel, and at The Argonaut Hotel you get the bonus of staying in an area of town that is fun, safe and filled with excellent tourist and eating options.","Jan 8, 2008","2","1",4,4,3,5,4,5,4,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_9388","Loved the Serrano! This small boutique hotel provided us with the very personal service (How are you today, Mr.  Mrs. H?) that makes you feel special. We were upgraded for free for our honeymoon. The executive suite is lovely, with large jacuzzi tub, lots of granite tile, and antique furniture. Beautiful lobby, very clean room, and pretty, cheerful decor takes away from the drab rain of the city, and is so much nicer than the generic big-box hotel rooms. Great firm mattress, fine linens and down duvet. Prompt attention to small problems or requests. Concierge got us into a great nearby restaurant (John's Grill) at the last minute for NYE. Ponzu restaurant (attached to hotel) was excellent for a romantic dinner (try the lemongrass steak and fried rice)! Top-rated Dottie's Cafe is just around the corner, and worth the wait for breakfast (awesome berry torte). While the hotel is on the edge of the Tenderloin district, we never felt like we were in an unsafe area, although there are many street people everywhere in SF, it seems. You are only 3 blocks from Union Square shopping, cable cars, etc. Other perks: free ethernet connection, mini-fridge, in-room safe, nice large LCD TV, free games to borrow from the lobby, free evening wine tasting. One caveat: the lobby was quite chilly from the frequent blasts of cold outside air whenever the door opened.One other word of warning--its true, Alcatraz tours sell out a week ahead, so buy tickets ahead or you'll be paying more to get them from a scalper or broker.You really don't need a car with all the transportation options, but the one day we rented a car to drive a little farther out, we took advantage of the free valet parking for hybrids (otherwise valet is $40, and garages nearby are 25-30/day).

"hotel_136","hotel_10459","First Class experience We stayed at the Serrano for 4 nights, from Dec. 14-18, 2007. We booked this hotel as part of a flight/hotel package on Travelocity at a very reasonable price and found it to be one of the few hotels that have an almost perfect rating on TripAdvisor and Travelocity's rating system.Well, we were not disappointed! Serrano is a 4 star hotel amenities wise, but a 5-star in terms of service, overall quality of the facility, cleanliness, location, etc. Highly recommended!Some specific points people might find useful:- Parking if you have a hybrid is free (COOL!) Otherwise, parking is VERY expensive at and around the hotel. Better to take transit or a shuttle to the hotel and rent a car by the day. Car rentals are within 1 block of the Serrano. Cheapest way to Serrano from SFO is to take the BART from the airport right to the Powell station. From there it is a 5 minute walk to the hotel. $5.15 one way per person and 30 minutes. Easy. - Serrano is part of the Kimpton managed chain. It is owned by someone else, but Kimpton does a superlative job managing it.- the hotel is located just 3 small blocks from Union Square, so is very central to the good stuff of downtown, the cable cars, nob hill, shopping, Chinatown, etc. The hotel is central to all the walking areas. I love to walk so this was important.- from 5-6pm the hotel hosts a complimentary wine hour in the lobby, which is very nice.- the rooms are spotless, well maintained, up to date, and quiet. - we booked a King deluxe and when we got there, we negotiatted at the same price for a queen for 2 nights and a suite for 2 nights. Both were excellent. The suite had a 2 person jacuzzi. Both rooms had views of the city from the 11th and 10th floors respectively.- the theme of this Kimpton hotel is games (literally) and they have a range to borrow. We saw only a young family buying into the theme and we did, but it is a nice touch that separates the Serrano from the competition and makes it more personal and fun.- the business center has big screen computers and free internet access. Free internet comes with every room too. The fitness room is bright and clean, but small. There is a dry sauna. Nothing special in this area, but people were using it. There are more expensive boutiques and the Serrano is more a boutique than a big hotel, but it is impressive in that it delivers a really great stay for a reasonable price.

The standard room (double double) is a very good size and immaculate with a good size bathroom, sat tv and minibar. The hotel in general was spotless and the staff friendly and I cannot fault it. The location of the hotel makes it ideal for getting around and the trams for all the routes you need are close by. The major shops you need are all within 2 blocks most notably Old Navy, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Barneys and a fabulous Macy's are all within ten mins walk maximum.If I visit again and can get the hotel for the same bargain price I would definetly stay here again.

When we arrived Saturday night in the pouring rain, our cab was promptly greeted by a doorman with a huge umbrella and a luggage cart. Check in was smooth, and the front desk clerk could not have been nicer giving us maps and a layout of the city. I will admit that the location of this property is on the edge of a bad neighborhood, but the front desk is helpful in telling you where NOT to go to avoid the worst part. Our room is small, but I expected that, so I wasn't disappointed. The bed is super comfortable: fluffy, clean, white comforter and fluffy pillows. The bathroom is marble with a sizeable tub with shower. Water pressure is fabulous. Aveda shampoo, conditioner and lotion is a nice touch. Towels are soft and monogrammed with an S. The one problem with the bathroom is that you can't really sit straight on the toilet since it is so close to the wall.Cheetah bathrobes hanging in the closet and the toys and games they have in the mini bar area are just a fun idea. I goofed off with the etch-a-sketch for a while and my husband is still threatening to walk the dog with the yoyo. There is a safe and free internet access (wired, not wireless) and the items in the mini bar were not as ridiculously priced as some I've experienced in the past. Really good coffee is available in the lobby from 5am to 10am, and we didn't make it to the wine/beer reception, but they have that daily from 5 to 6. We got in late and ate dinner at the attached restaurant, Ponzu which was pricey but good with average service. All in all, it's been a really great experience. Every time we come back in, we're greeted with, Welcome back! and we've been happy to be back.","Nov 13, 2007","4","4",5,5,4,6,6,6,5,"4","$326"

The hotel itself is absolutely wonderful, with the best service I encountered in my month in the US. I had a corner room on the 12th floor with lovely views. The decor was beautiful and the bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The bathroom was small however as I was travelling alone, it wasn't a problem. The wine in the afternoon was a wonderful touch and I was pleased to see that it was Australian wine! I would defintely stay here again and I've also recommended it to all of my friends.","Nov 5, 2007","3","2",6,6,5,6,6,6,1,"4","$326"

There are many restaurants close by.The hotel is very welcoming, and the free wine hour every day goes down a treat. The room had everything I needed but felt a little small (quite common in San Fran). Although an old hotel it has been refurbished with modern rooms, with very small bathrooms, and also has a nice gym area.I would recommend this hotel for people wanting to stay where the action is with great access to Fisherman's Wharf.","Nov 5, 2007","1","1",4,5,6,6,5,5,5,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_3690","Very Surprised Good Hotel When in SF I usually stay at either the Marriott or Hilton. Both hotels just mentioned were booked and we ended up at the Serrano....I was prepared for the worst. Boy was I mistaken. Upon entering they have a very nicely done lobby...they were serving wine and beer free to the guest of the hotel...nice touch...also this is done daily from 5pm to 6pm. Check-in was routine and headed to my room on the 8th floor. I had a corner room. Upon entering it was clean and updated....not very big...but your in the wrong city if you plan on staying in your room too much...there is much to do in SF. The bathroom was clean and the shower head was at least 8ft up the wall.....I notice these things because I am a mid 6 footer.....and great water pressure by the way. I never ate in the hotel....too many great restaurants to go to. Be sure to eat at Dotties when in SF....it is just around the corner to your right....up 1 block on Jones street. Look at Trip Advisor comments about Dotties True Blue Cafe....its a great place to eat. When returning to SFO I will definitely keep the Serrano in mind.....very pleased with my stay.","Oct 18, 2007","7","7",5,5,4,5,5,5,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_8907","Great place to stay in San Francisco We stayed at the Serrano from Oct 4-9, 2007. It was a very enjoyable experience. The staff was so friendly. We had a room with a great view as we had requested, and when we got back to our room after dinner on our first night there was a personal note from the manager along with a small box of chocolates, bottled water, and juice. Anytime we needed anything, from extra hangers to towels, they arrived within 2 or 3 minutes! Also, the bell man was so nice to arrange a taxi for us (without us asking him to) at 4:45am on our last day as we had a very eary flight out. We also had fun at the wine hour each night.The only downside to the room was the bathroom. Like other reviewers have said, there is no place to put anything in the bathroom.The location was convienent . You didn't want to walk down Taylor street, but taking O'Ferrall over toward Union Square area was just fine. Also, between 7-9am the hotel has a complimentary Town Car that will take you anywhere you want to go-FREE! They took us to the Ferry Building to catch our Wine Tour to Napa Valley.Overall, it was a very enjoyable place to stay and we would stay there again!","Oct 15, 2007","3","3",5,5,5,6,6,6,5,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_7284","It did the trick! Clean and Comfortable...but a little cramped. This hotel stay was offered in return for attending a timeshare presentation at another location...ugh! But for an hour and a half of our time it was worth it. The hotel is not in a very savory neighborhood (The Tenderloin for those who know), but it is very close to Union Square and there are lots of hotels around there so it is not likely that you will encounter much trouble. It is in the theater district, and near Nob Hill, SoMa--long story short it is pretty convenient to get just about anywhere in the downtown area and it is near Muni (bus/streetcar) lines that will take you further out towards Golden Gate Park, Haight/Ashbury, etc. This old building has been lovingly transitioned into a perfectly lovely hotel. Nice fixtures and furnishings. Clean. Nice staff. Valet parking is free for hybrid vehicles, but others needing parking might want to try the big garage directly across the street for cheaper parking than the hotel valet offers. We actually took Bay Area Rapid Transit from the Oakland airport, got off at Powell St., and walked to the hotel from there). We did not go to Ponzu (the hotel restaurant), but it seemed to be hoppin' and seemed to draw more than just hotel guests. There is a lot of good food in the area though so that is certainly not your only option. Our room was a double with two queen beds--it was small but comfortable (2 adults and a 3 1/2 year old) and nicely appointed. It was also quiet!!! The bathroom was tiny but nice as well. The leopard print bathrobes were a fun touch. Plush towels, nice linens, ipod dock/clock radio (did not work but was quickly swapped out when they were notified). The room seemed to have the bells and whistles one would want these days...it just was not very big. I would consider staying here again and I think my husband and daughter wouldn't mind either. I am sorry I did not take pix of the hotel--I should have, but their website is representative of what we experienced.","Oct 8, 2007","2","2",5,5,5,5,4,5,4,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_9460","Small, small, small! It was just a one-night trip, visiting friends. I had no choice, since it was booked via Priceline the day before.First off the positives in no particular order: IPOD alarm clock, plush bed and linens, tastefully decorated.Lastly in no particular order: Mini frig, even though it's inside the TV armoire, was particularly noisy. The key for the minibar was broken, so I'm not sure an employee or a previous guest ate or drank something. Room was small, even though I seemed to have one of the bigger rooms on the floor, based on the emergency floor plan. My room number was 709 facing O'Farrell. I had a view of the Columbia Hotel (rundown) and a view of the Hilton kitty corner to the Serrano.The bathroom was small. There was no room to place toiletries. I had to use part of the bathtub and the top of the toilet to place toiletries. The toilet location was awkward. You couldn't close the door to use it, if you know what I mean. The shower pressure was excellent.The rooms along O'Farrell don't have enough sound insulation from the road noise below. I can't imagine what it must sound like on the lower floors.Room service selections sparse for a supposed 4-star hotel and you must order between 5-10pm for dinner.The area isn't too bad. Just don't go west or south (Tenderloin). Go north, and you hit Nob Hill. Go east, and you hit Union Square.If you need parking, park across the street at the California Garage for $32 total. It was advertised as $26 with in and out privileges, but there is a 25% tax on parking (RIP OFF). But it's better than paying $44 at the Serrano.What else? The fitness center was well equipped. It had 2 treadmills, a recumbant bike, 2 elliptical trainers, and I think it was one of those ski things. Anyways, the cardio equipment were equipped with personal cable TV's. It had a small area for free weights, had one multi-purpose lifting machine, and a weight bench. It was satisfactory.The business center was pay per use.Check-in was friendly; however, checkout was not after expressing my dissatisfaction with the outside noise on the O'Farrell side of the hotel.Overall, NOT a 4-star. I would maybe rate this as a 3.5 star. I would only stay here, if it was priced under $100 a night.","Sep 6, 2007","0","0",5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_6020","Nice For the Price Flew into Oakland, then took the BART to Powell Station. Walked to the hotel which was about 3 blocks. Checked in, went up to the room, walked in and found it was small for what we reserved, a King Deluxe. Went back to the lobby and the desk person, Artem, was very apologetic. Sent up a bottle of wine and it was there before we made it to the room. Upgraded us to a suite with a huge walk-in shower with stereo and t.v. in it. 7 shower heads, one of which was about 10 inches in diameter. Talk about not wanting to get out. The room was on the back side of the hotel, Room 401, no view which was fine with us because there was almost no road noise. One word of caution, this area is a little iffy. If you're not comfortable with homeless or panhandlers, its probably better to take taxis or stay at Fisherman's Wharf. We rented a car for one day, with a GPS navigator for an extra $12. Best $12 we ever spent. Don't rent a car without one. It's especially great because of all the one way streets in SF. The rest of the days there we used the public transportation. If you don't mind buses, this is a good deal. We spent $18 each for a 3 day muni-pass which allowed us access to all the buses, cables cars, and old time trolley cars. We went all over the city. It took us a little longer, but we didn't have to worry about paying for parking. If you like Thai food, try the Osha Thai Noodle Cafe. It's the best Thai food we've ever had. Corner of Leavenworth and Geary. Two blocks from the hotel and its open late.","Sep 5, 2007","2","2",5,5,4,4,5,5,4,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_2171","Horrible Experience I recently stayed at the Hotel Serrano for Labor Day weekend, along with my boyfriend and another couple. We had a horrible experience with this hotel and it's staff. We not only made a reservation, but had Pre-Paid it in advance. We originally booked 1 room with 2 double beds. We also arranged for a late check-in, since we would be driving up from Los Angeles after work. We had confirmation online, as well as over the phone a few days earlier. When we arrived at the hotel at 2 in the morning after an extremely long drive, we were not greeted by any staff. We then proceeded to check in at the front desk, when the staff member simply looked at us and said, Nope. There's 4 of you, but we only have you down for a single room with 1 bed. We disagreed, and explained that we had Pre-Paid for a double room. We even showed him the itinerary and invoice we had printed online. He just shook his head and said, Nope. He told us that all of their double rooms have been booked. He never apologized, and even got defensive saying that this was not the hotel's fault. He did not try to accommodate us at all for their mistake. When we were about to leave, he hesitantly offered us 2 separate smoking rooms. We definitely did not want to take the smoking rooms, so he then offered a suite..but we would have to pay the difference in price. Why should we have to pay more for a suite after they gave up the room that we had already reserved AND paid for?! So fine, we were so tired, we just agreed to stay in the separate single rooms for that night. The next morning, after talking to the manager of housekeeping, we were moved to a double room with 1 bed and a sofa bed (which we had to call down to the front desk again because we had no blankets/pillows for the sofa bed). For our inconvenience, they also gave us a voucher for a continental breakfast for 2, even though there were 4 of us. Whatever. When we went to redeem our voucher in the morning, their restaurant had closed early without any notice, so we were not able to get our breakfast. Lastly, upon checking out, we noticed that they had charged us an extra $120 for a late check-in! We had already arranged for a late check-in prior, and had already paid for everything in advance, but they still tried to charge us when we were leaving!! Our stay was a complete disaster, and not a single staff member was at all apologetic for their mistakes, or friendly at all for that matter. DO NOT STAY AT THE SERRANO. They treated us as if we were trying to get something for free, when all we wanted was what we had paid for! They did not want to honor our PRE-PAID RESERVATION, and we had to fight to get a mediocre room without paying extra.","Sep 4, 2007","5","5",2,4,3,4,2,2,4,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_5780","Wonderful Hotel This is a wonderful hotel - excellent service from the time of check in till check out. We stayed for 4 days in August and had no problems. Rooms are typical for boutique, but you are there to see the city/area, not to hang out in the hotel room. Very clean, comfortable beds, Aveda bath products. Daily excellent coffee, wine at night. They make you very comfortable and I only paid $140/night, which I thought was an excellent value.

"hotel_136","hotel_6705","Wonderful place to stay I enjoyed my stay at the Serrano. I was there on business and had a wonderful three night stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. I had a suite and both the bedroom and the sitting room were nice sized, and nicely decorated. The only drawback to the Serrano was the bathroom. It was clean, but there was no place to put anything--no counter at all. I had to keep everything in the bedroom on the table and carry in my toothbrush, etc. for use in the bathroom. The restaurant in the hotel is fantastic. Great service and asian fusion fare made from the freshest ingredients. I ate there two nights of the three I was in town. I really like old buildings and converted or restored hotels, and the Serrano is a great example. Every morning there was fresh coffee and every evening a wine reception. One other reviewer said not to turn right--that to the right was the red light district. Respectfully, I disagree. If you turn right, after a couple of blocks you'll find yourself in the tenderloin district--a bit seedy and populated by the homeless. I wouldn't recommend walking alone through the tenderloin--I did it once and decided discretion was the better part of valor. But, I wouldn't worry at all if I were with someone else.","Aug 12, 2007","0","0",5,5,5,6,5,6,6,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_6778","Nice Room, Poor Service Overall, our stay was fine but the hotel made various promises that weren't met and some of the staff demonstrated really poor customer service. Upon arrival, we could not check in 15 minutes early...and then we weren't able to check in at the advertised check in time...we finally checked in a half hour late, which was somewhat stressful because we had to get to a wedding.The room was beautifully decorated, though small. Our reservation said king room but we were given a room with a queen bed. We had to order extra pillows since we were only given two. I am a member of the Kimpton frequent sleeper program and am suppossed to get some kind of welcome amenity but that never appeared either. The room was extremely quiet, with very little street noise.The worst part of the hotel is breakfast at the attached restaurant. We thought it would be easier to just eat at the hotel, which was a mistake. The staff there provided the worst customer service i have ever recieved at a restaurant in the united states. The food was overpriced and average. We were seated by a huge group of people with several small children. We had to ask repeatedly for coffee and then we had to wait and ask repeatedly for refills. We had to ask repeatedly for a glass of water. Several parties arrived after us, and recieved their menus, coffees, and food before we did. What breakfast place doesn't keep their diners' coffee cups refilled? I could have gotten better service and the same food for $4 at a greasy spoon. There are a lot of breakfast places in the area, so I strongly encourage you to plan to eat elsewhere.Overall, the room was great but the hyped customer service and special frequent stayer's club failed to a high degree. I don't recommend.","Aug 12, 2007","0","0",2,5,5,6,2,2,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_1903","Great boutique Hotel This a lovely hotel restored to it's former glory after this area went into a long decline and was skid row for a few decades. Now it's around the corner from the theatre district and a couple of blocks from Union Square. It's a block from it's sister hotel The Monaco(which is dazzling) but a bit less expensive. We got the usual warm reception for our dog that is typical of Kimpton properties. Our room was lovely, on the 14th floor. The closet was minuscule but the rest of the room was well decorated with luxury touches and a view of the east bay and roof tops. The evening wine reception from 5-6 pm was fun and we met several lovely people from the US and overseas because of our icebreaker dog. The staff went out of the way to be friendly and helpful. They were professional but unpretentious and seemed to love working there. The 24 hour parking is absurdly expensive ($49.00) but directly across the street is an 24 hour lot with in and out privileges and high end customer service for half the rate. This hotel is close to all the main attractions and transportations. Don't miss the SF museums which are easy to reach via public transport, taxi or car. Favorite neighbourhood is the North Beach and Coit Tower area (wild parrots in the Eucalyptus trees) and wonderful, inexpensive Italian food at the bustling but comfortable Pasta Pomodoro on Market near colorful gay Castro district.","Aug 12, 2007","1","1",6,5,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$326"

I got into some terrific conversations. Location is excellent. Walking distance to most of the theatres, close to all the major bus lines, and a couple of streets away from the cable car line if you are inclined to ride a cable car.The view from our window was excellent.Every day we came back to a very clean room, and the bed (especially made for Kimpton hotels) was amazingly comfortable.

North of the hotel the area is very nice, leading to the main square. However, south/east of the hotel it can get pretty frustrating, having to walk among a bunch of drugged out homeless persons. The hotel itself has a sort of 'games' theme - the lobby personnel will lend you your choice of some 30 board games that the hotel has on stock (some however, are missing a lot of pieces, etc). The rooms are tiny, although the bed is really big and comfortable. Bathroom is also quite small, but is well stocked with nice Avena toiletries. We got an upgrade and a breakfast package - the breakfast at the Ponzo restaurant was however disappointing and I would have not liked to pay for that.

"hotel_136","hotel_5973","Displeased with overall experience Had we realized the location of this hotel, we would not have stayed here. Unfortunately we walked through the tenderloin area to get to the hotel after staying a couple of nights at a 5 star hotel. If you are not familiar with the tenderloin area, there are many homeless people there and some appeared to openly be using drugs After walking past a couple of police officers who directed us into the safe area, we got to the hotel. The hotel was not surrounded by great establishments and right next door was a massage parlor.The staff was pretty nice and we checked in. The room was extremely small and the bathroom was very small and not very easy to use. The showstopper for us was the strong smell of bug spray in the room. My husband and I noticed it immediately and woke up several times during the night bothered by it. It was overwhelming. As we have limited vacation time, and were uncomfortable with the location (and the bug spray smell), we cut our vacation short by two nights and got an early flight back. Unfortunately, since we booked through on online travel service, we were unable to get a refund for the last two nights ($440)! But it was worth not having to sleep in a room that smelled like bug spray. And---we were worried---if it smelled that much like bug spray, is there a big problem with bugs?In any event, most of the staff was very nice it was just the size, smell of the room, and location that was a turn off.","Jul 26, 2007","1","0",2,2,2,4,4,4,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_7377","So charming! My mom and I booked a room here for the weekend of a family gathering and to see a show at the Curran Theatre. The hotel makes a great effort to add charm and warmth to an already-welcoming space; the lobby is filled with comfortable chairs in small groups and low tables featuring classic card  board games. Some here have mentioned the well-attended wine tastings in the evening, but there is also a nice coffee service in the morning. When we returned to our hotel after the play, people were still relaxing around the fireplace with a glass of wine, playing cards. The secret, I think, to this homey feel is the extraordinarily friendly service. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel was helpful and engaging. The room was not huge, but it was much bigger than I had been led to expect from the reviews here - in fact, the room featured a well-sized bathtub. The only complaint I have is that they charge for computer access in the much-publicized business center. For a hotel in this price range, with keycode access to the biz center, it seems insulting to tack on a usage and printing charge.

"hotel_136","hotel_7787","Unhelpful staff, small room My husband ,two dtrs and I stayed here for 4 nights .The hotel is stylish but its position is rather suspect as adjoining the Tenderloin, consequently it was often a battle to walk from Union Square to the lobby door at night without being approached by homeless,druggies , drunks , itinerant folk etc. A reality check for the kids but all rather depressing after a while .We booked a double double room on a high floor which was quiet and very clean and well furnished but as stated by previous reviewers very small. Once our 4 cases were brought it there was hardly room to get around the beds. The bathroom had insufficient storage / shelving for a mum and 2 dtrs !! There is a bar/ restaurant attached which does great cocktails but this was not very well publicized by reception staff who were polite but not that helpful.My husband left his credit card in a nearby ATM just before we checked out. When he went to pay he realised and had to use my card . He explained to staff what had happened and then spent 45 mins trying to get through to cc company in UK on his mobile to cancel the card , he was very stressed as the calls were being frequently cut off. The reception staff did nothing to help, did not offer him the use of their phone or a private room as he had checked out. Leaving him to call from a very public lobby area.Their attitude seemed to be that the bill was paid so job done  Very dissappointing service , very impersonal ,overall it sullied our view of the place which we thought was slightly overpriced anyway for a boutique hotel .","Jul 23, 2007","3","0",4,3,3,6,3,3,6,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_4316","It's ok, but mjuch better in San Francisco Having stayed at multiple Kimpton group hotels over the past 6 to 12 months overall this hotel was a disappointment. The service is fine and the lobby is indeed beautiful, the downfall is the rooms even by San Francisco standards are small. In fact the bathrooms on most cruise ships almost seems spacious as compared to the room. The loo is within 3 inches of the outer wall making using it almost an experience. As with all Kimpton group hotels the rooms are quite comfortable and definitely live up to the boutique standard. The location is also suspect as it borders the start of the tenderloin district. Make sure to get directions when you leave because walking in the wrong direction even a block can lead to a potentially dangerous experience at night.","Jun 26, 2007","2","2",4,3,3,6,4,5,5,"4","$326"

Very cramped, with toothbrush, etc., fit along the narrow edge of the sink. If not for this I would have given it 5 stars.No breakfast, but good coffee in the lobby and I appreciated the selection of newspapers: SF Chronicle, WSJ, NYT.The beds are all new - they were still in the process of replacing some on the day that I arrived.The airconditioning was a pain. If it gets too cold, and you adjust the temp up, the air never turns back on. I had it at 70, but it went to 76. Twice, I had to turn it off, wait 5 min, and then turn it back on to get it to cool again.The location was great.

It is only 2-3 blocks from all the shopping in Union Square, Chinatown, and a few more blocks to the SF MOMA. If you are up for a challenge, it is along a very long walk to the Pier . For breakfast, as suggested by the hotel staff, try Dottie's True Blue Cafe (1.5 blocks away, but long line) or Maxwell's (reasonable city pricing for a hearty breakfast).","Jun 11, 2007","2","2",5,5,5,6,6,6,4,"4","$326"

But the staff was very friendly, nice, and helpful anyway. I stayed here twice in December. It's a boutique hotel, so the small rooms and tiny elevator is to be expected.

The bathroom was cramped at best. There was no place to set or hang cosmetic bags, except on a towel rack that was right against the toilet. One had to shut the bathroom door by backing into the toilet or sink. Good things about the hotel was the coffee and tea service in the morning and the wine reception in the afternoon. The staff were all extremely interested in the welfare of all the guests. Friendly, as welll as accomodating. They allowed us to extend our checkout until 1 when his meeting was over. The hotel was a couple blocks from Union Square. The theater district had a number of homeless sleeping on the street. We found a number of small breakfast cafes in the area, trying a different one each morning. All were reasonably priced.

"hotel_136","hotel_6647","nice boutique in america's most fantastic city I just returned from a great weekend stay at the Serrano in downtown San Francisco May 11-14.The hotel is a very cool boutique property, part of the Kimpton chain. It's located in the Union Square West area, about 2 1/2 blocks from the square itself and about the same distance from the Powell Street cable car turnaround and BART/Muni station.The lobby is small, warm and boutique-chic, with ambient music playing in the background and pleasant sitting areas. The staff, from the doormen to the concierge to the front desk people, are warm and friendly, always greeting you when you walk through the door.There were only two elevators, but given that the hotel has only about 200-something rooms on 14 or so floors, that was rarely a problem.My room, a queen, was compact, but well-equipped and the space was well utilized. The Serrano is decorated in a more traditional motif than the modern minimalism that's more typical these days, with quirky light fixtures and an attractive burgundy color scheme.The bed was very comfortable, perhaps a little firmer than I like but that was a minor gripe. The armoire contained the television, minibar and closet, including two faux leopard-skin bathrobes. The bathroom was small, but with an ample shower and tub, and niceties such as Aveda bath products.The room also contained a few offbeat extras, such as a yoyo and mini Etch-a-Sketch. I didn't try the room service from the onsite restaurant, Ponzu, but the menu looked innovative.The hotel offered a daily wine reception in the lobby at 5 p.m., and there was free coffee (of good quality) in the lobby in the mornings.The location was great, close to the Union Square shopping district and lots of public transit - BART subway, MUNI buses and streetcars, and the famous cable cars. (Although you'll spend all day waiting for one at the Powell Street turnaround - best to take the Wharf trolley around to cheesy Fisherman's Wharf and take the cable car from there back to Powell Street). Yes, the seedy Tenderloin is a couple of blocks away, but the immediate area around the Serrano is your typical downtown commercial district, full of restaurants, fast food joints, offices etc etc. Dining options within a few blocks are legion, including a 24-hour Indian restaurant, Thai, Japanese, steakhouses and so on and so on.The Serrano is a nice place to stay in a great, great city. And for $75 a night on Priceline, it was a steal.","May 16, 2007","3","3",6,5,5,5,5,5,1,"4","$326"

The service was very helpful and nice too. When we arrived we asked for a different room and they immediately gave it to us. The location was excellent for sightseeing.

I chose it for its proximity to the Hilton, as I was attending a conference at the Hilton but prefer to stay at small boutique hotels. I thought the hotel was ok. Service was generally friendly but unexceptional. We arrived in the early afternoon and the first room they gave us was tiny and faced a brick wall. They gave us a much better room (1106) later in the afternoon. The room was small but manageable by SF standards. The bathroom was very small and awkward, easy to bang your elbows on irregular walls. Decor a bit cheesy and uninspiring, although admittedly we prefer modern design. Morning coffee and evening wine reception were good. We got a parking package which was good value. Last time I attended the same conference I stayed at the Adagio which was much nicer. for similar rates Next time I would return to the Adagio, or spend a bit more for the Nikko or Clift.

Skip the hotel restaurant however especially for breakfast since there are many coffess shops withing a block or two of the hotel.We'd definately go back.

"hotel_136","hotel_2886","Overrated And Overpriced! The Serrano is overrated and overpriced. The exterior and interior of the building are old, dingy and overall unimpressive. When I first saw the hotel, I was actually a bit shocked at its nondescript, old looking exterior. In addition, the room was nothing special and the bathroom had problems.On the phone when I was confirming my online reservation, I specifically requested a room on the highest level possible with the best view possible and I received the exact opposite--a room on the 5th floor with the worst view possible of the fire escape and ugly building walls. Hotel staff claimed they never received my telephonic request. What poor service! To compensate, staff subsequently offered to give me a suite for the price of a regular room on my next visit. However, I do not care to stay at the Serrano again. So, that compensation is meaningless.The bathroom was very small and a lot of water leaked from the shower whenever we used it. The bathroom was very old and reminded me of the bathroom in my grandmother's 100+ year-old house in L.A. The location is central and good for walking to Union Square. But, so what! Better hotels can be had in that general area for the same or lower price. For example, I stayed at GROSVENOR SUITES on Nob Hill for a lower price than at the Serrano and was much, much happier with the spacious room, extremely generous closet space and great customer service.","Apr 4, 2007","6","1",3,2,5,5,4,2,4,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_1929","Small but nice. Surrounding area is so-so. Like everyone else says, the hotel room is small. Not small enough that you feel cramped, just small. The bathroom has a small counter, which is already filled up with the shampoo, soap, tissues, and complimentary make-up remover pads and cotton swabs. There is barley enough room to put down your makeup bag or your toothbrush.The bed was very nice and comfortable. The I-Pod clock was a plus, but it was never updated for the time change. The staff was very nice, and the complimentary coffee/tea in the morning was nice to grab on your way out to town.I was not impressed by the breakfast at Ponzu. They did not have a wide assortment of food, nor did they serve ice tea. We had to get up and ask for our check after sitting there for 10 minutes waiting. Ponzu's bar was expensive, but we expected that. Our sever was extremely nice and we had a fun time.The area does have come shady characters. If you smoke, be prepared for a rush of people asking to bum or buy a cigarette from you. If you go down to the BART and hesitate at the ticket machine, someone will offer to help you, but then ask for money.The F-line trolleys are all historic cars, and they will jam as many people was possible into them. Be prepared to be very close to your fellow travelers and watch out for the bumpy ride.We bought the City Pass and it was great. You never need to worry about buying trolley passes (BART not included), and you get tickets to wonderful things like the Blue  Gold cruise and The Aquarium of the Bay. Both are at Pier 39.We parked across the street at the California parking garage and it was $28 a day for hotel guests. I did not see any place cheaper near by, and the staff there was nice, so I would recommend it.We did not get to try the complimentary wine tasting but we did walk by when they were setting up and it looked very nice.

"hotel_136","hotel_7924","good for tourists, great location  We stayed in a standard queen for 4 nights while on vacation in Feb'07. Good points: Hotel's location is within easy access to Union Square, where you can start your day in great style. Serrano had some really friendly and courteous staff and also offers complimentary wireless internet access.On the flip side, the size of a standard queen room is very average and they are comparatively small for 4-star standards. For SFO city tourists, it doesn鈥檛 matter too much as there is plenty of options outside the room for a quality vacation time, leave alone the colour of carpets or interior wall paintings. Rooms were clean and kept nicely at appreciable standards and we had no problems at all with the room service. Hotel has an integrated restaurant (Ponzu) and offers a selection of oriental mix menu and is definitely worth trying once, though' priced a bit on the high-end. Continental breakfast offered is good but I would suggest skip that after your first day and there are plenty of options in Geary/Post Street a short walk just around the corner towards union square.Overall, quite handy hotel for tourists and of course bear in mind that it offers less space in their standard rooms.

"hotel_136","hotel_3478","Not Kimpton quality After staying at several Kimptons elsewhere, I was looking forward to my four nights at the Serrano. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my previously stellar Kimpton stays (Monaco and Burnham in Chicago; Muse in NYC).Many of my comments echo those of another recent reviewer. The staff, though cordial at check-in, essentially ignored my existence from then on. I was particularly surprised when, on two separate occasions, the doormen suggested that I catch a cab at the hotel on the next block rather than hailing one for me (not fun when it's cold and rainy). Desk space in the room was extremely small for the business traveler, and there is absolutely no shelf/counter space in the bathroom - though this is often true of city hotels. However, the lighting was about the worst I've ever encountered in a hotel - only one lamp on the desk and another beside the bed, leaving the other side of the room completely in the dark. It would have been impossible to read while sitting in the armchair.However, what bothered me most was the condition of my room. The carpet was absolutely filthy, turning my white socks grey in no time. The windows were horribly dirty as well - making me wonder if the place ever received anything more than a very superficial cleaning. This is quite a contrast from other Kimptons, wihch I've found to be impeccably clean. Also suprising was the fact that housekeeping didn't leave any new bars of soap, or replenish other toiletries, or empty water from the ice bucket, during my four night stay.To be fair, there were pluses: the location was great - a very short walk to Union Square and Market Street (Nordstrom/Bloomingdales); several restaurants within walking distance, including two Starbucks within a two-block range. I did not feel at all unsafe walking in the neightborhood. The room was quiet; I did not hear much street noise (though admittedly I was on an upper floor). The morning coffee and evening wine were very nice, and the lobby was as fabulous as it appears on the website (providing a very nice place to sit over coffee).In summary - not a horrible experience, but a disappointing one. I don't plan on staying there again.","Mar 7, 2007","2","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_3388","Style and Location Best Assets I stayed here for two nights on business travel. This is a stylish hotel and I liked the playfulness of the ambience. Lobby is very nice. Staff (front desk, bellmen) were very solicitous and attentive when I was checking in (late night, slow) but then the same staff didn't even acknowledge my presence the rest of my stay, e.g. open the front door, offer to help with my bags when checking out, etc. I couldn't get a hold of the front desk or operator by phone to set my wake up calls either of the two nights. It's good I brought a little travel alarm. The inconsistency re service was disconcerting. My room was nicely decorated like Kimpton hotels usually are but it was very small. The desk was cluttered with a lot of things (wine glasses, brochures, hotel information, etc.), so my laptop and business files were crowded in. Nowhere else really to put stuff. The room and bath were clean but generally pretty small. I had to put my toiletries kit and make up bag on the floor outside the bathroom since there was nowhere to place them in the bathroom since everything was so small. The one thing besides style that was in abundance was mirrors! Location is a short three-walk block from Union Square - very nice. If you have a car, park in the parking garage across the street for $28 overnight or right next door for a little less (although the latter is often full) rather than using the hotel valet for $44 overnight + tip. Restaurant was not great. Overall the size of the room was inconvenient for me as a business traveler, so I probably won't stay there again.","Feb 27, 2007","0","0",4,4,5,5,5,4,5,"4","$326"

Yes, the room was on the small side and the windows do not open, but for a night out, we were quite comfortable and pleased. After walking around the Union Square area looking at different restaurants, we wound up back at Ponzu, the hotel's restaurant where earlier we had enjoyed an excellent happy hour with cocktails and small bites. Bartender was great fun. Dinner was absolutely stellar, highly recommended Asian-Pacific fusion in a very stylish setting.

We have stayed in many hotels in the city, and were anxious to stay at the Hotel Serrano after watching it featured on Great Hotels with Samantha Brown. We had an executive suite for the four of us which was freshly decorated and bit too cozy with the pull out sofa. We literally had to crawl over our kids to get to the bathroom at night. The gaming theme is fun and we literally spent hours as a family playing various games in the lobby or the room. The wine hour was a nice treat! This hotel does reside on the border of the Tenderloin and you will be approached by the homeless if you head out of the hotel on foot.. We never felt unsafe though. The one mistake we made was parking our SUV in the valet parking, only to note the $55 charge on our bill the next morning! We later discovered that there are two covered garages with in/out priviledges adjacent to the property at half the price. In fact, the hotel parks their cars in one of them.

"hotel_136","hotel_6132","Liked the Serrano We stayed at the Serrano from Oct. 26-29. We liked it. When checking in, we were greeted by friendly people. We arrived early and were given a room right away. Unfortunately, we asked for a King size bed so we had to wait for one to be available. The rooms were small but clean. I knew ahead of time so it was no problem. We didn't spend much time there anyway. It's close to a lot of things, we walked just about everywhere. Conveniently located to the BART system, the cable cars, shopping and food places.There was some wear and tear on the room but it didn't bother us. The drapes had a tear in them and the bathroom door was a little dented but no big deal.Like the wine reception and coffee in the morning. We ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast one day. The food was great!All in all, if you don't like boutique hotels, don't stay here. But if you do, I highly recommend it!","Oct 31, 2006","3","3",5,4,5,4,5,5,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_1109","Enjoyed the Serrano Our stay coincided with Fleet Week in Oct., 2006, so the city was packed. We wanted a 2-bed room, which seem to be hard to come by in downtown SF. Our room was small but nicely appointed. We liked the bathrobes. We were on the top floor and had a nice view.I enjoyed the wine reception each evening and the coffee in the lobby in the morning.It's true that the hotel borders on the red light district, so it is best to walk straight up the street past the Hilton rather than going downhill and angling over if you are walking to Powell. We liked being close to the car rental agencies as we were renting a car at the end of our stay. There are many places to eat nearby, including Indian and Asian.","Oct 13, 2006","3","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_10108","Great hotel, lovely staff We stayed here 3 nights at the start of our 3 week holiday in California and I have to say it was one of the most all round best hotels we stayed in. The rooms are on the small side, but quite cosy and romantic and we loved the leopard print robes!. Ours was next door to the elevator and there was NO noise. Great location for Union Square. Staff were charming and helpful and I was mightily relieved when security retrieved my camera from the lobby and handed it to reception. I thought I would never see it again, so thanks for your honesty guys.The complimentary morning coffee and evening drinks reception were a really nice touch and so was the evening visiting 'entertainment, ( a tarot card reader and a masseur). We loved sitting in the extravagantly decorated lobby, curled up on a sofa after a busy day, people watching, drink in hand.We ate at the Cafe next door a (great casual food and same great service) and visited the Monaco round the corner, also very nice. I suspect our stay was much better value and we were made more welcome than at the Hilton directly opposite.I will definitley stay in a Kimpton hotel again - they have got it sooo right!","Sep 23, 2006","2","1",5,4,5,6,6,6,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_8083","2 Canadians loved their visit to the Serrano We visited the Serrano for 5 nights in August of 2006. It was our first time at a Kimpton hotel and if we can afford it, we will certainly stay at Kimpton's in other cities in our future travels. The Serrano has so much character. It has been beautifully restored/maintained and is very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we met a number of other guests and the manager at the complementary evening wine receptions. Other guests have commented on the proximity to the tenderloin (a less 'upscale' area of SF). I must admit that had me worried a bit prior to our arrival, but we felt safe walking to both union sq area and the fisherman's wharf area from the Serrano. The proximity to all we wanted to do in SF was exceptional. Interestingly, the Hilton is kitty corner from the Serrano - and one wouldn't often think of a Hilton being in a rough area.....Our room was very quiet (I took someone's advice and requested a room away from the elevator) and very clean. I know a number of guests have commented on the small bathroom - but how much room do you really need and I'd much rather it was clean than large. Around the corner (.5 block) on O'Farrell are a number of car rental places, so take everyone's advice and only rent a car for the days you want to travel outside of SF - as the parking is VERY expensive. Just as an FYI, the cable car line ups at both Union Sq. and at Fisherman's wharf are REALLY long.... So, listen to the advice of the locals and catch it at a stop along the way and save yourself some time and energy. It's one of those must do tourist things...SF is a great city to visit. We hope to return and would most definitely stay at the Serrano again if we do. Enjoy and I hope you find this helpful.","Aug 20, 2006","9","9",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_4182","Central Serrano Good reviews on Trip Advisor led us to the Serrano Hotel where we spent three nights in July. Upon our arrival, the doorman was very friendly as was the reception staff. The lobby decor is really ornate 'Casablanca' style, which is also reflected in the rooms. Our room was rather small but adequate, bathrobes hanging in the closet. The bathroom was a bit small too (no shelf to put your things) but had lovely Aveda products.There was a room safe and fridge but tea and coffee making facilities would have been good even though this is available in the lobby in the mornings only. The hotel puts on a free 'happy hour' at 5pm each night in the lobby and it was good to see people mingling and chatting. The concierge was extremely helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The hotels location is only two blocks away from Union Square and Powell Street which was really handy. Shopping, shopping everywhere! The only down side would be that it is on the edge of the Tenderloin district which is very seedy, having said that though, the Hilton Hotel is directly across the road. There is a great little cafe down the street, The Taylor Street Cafe where we had a great breakfast for about $6 each. There were plenty of good restaurants around and the subway system only a short walk away. We got the BART rail system to and from the airport which was only $5 each and fantastic.","Aug 18, 2006","4","4",5,5,5,6,6,6,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_9433","Really enjoyed the Serrano We have stayed at the Kimptons in Seattle and Portland with our 2 cats and I was thrilled when we got to take a nice long vacation and take our cats with us and stay at a Kimpton in San Francisco. It took me a long time to choose one (they have like 12 in SF alone!), but we had a lovely time and were very happy.Both front desk managers were delightful. We stayed 2 nights and I booked the first night in their standard room and then the relax and rejuvinate package for the 2nd night. The package was a deal!! It was $249 and included a plush bathrobe to keep, an hour massage (for my husband - he did most of the driving) and included the spa suite - A huge room with sitting area (large with big sofa, tv cabinet, desk etc..), bedroom that had curtains to close it off and a HUGE spa tub in a giant bathroom. Yes, the regular rooms are small, and the bathroom is tiny (for American standards), but they are well appointed and very nice. We also had a high floor with a stunning view downtown. The spa suite did not have a good view, but the room was such a treat I didn't care. Our cats LOVED the spa suite and both had a delightful stay too!We skipped the wine reception (1st night we were headed to Gary Danko's for dinner and didn't have reservations, so we wanted to arrive early to sit at the bar - fantastic experience by the way - and then the second night we were too tired). Also, we did not order any of the games from their game menu to try, but it was cool to see that they had a nice selection. Also, did not order food there, we did have a late breakfast at the Monaco (another Kimpton hotel next door) at the Grand Cafe and their food was good. They made a nice plum belini which we both thought was yummy.All in all we liked the Serrano very much, although with so many Kimptons to try next time we are in San Fran we will probably pick a different one for something new!","Aug 3, 2006","5","5",5,5,5,6,6,1,6,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_1301","Wonderful stay at Serrano We stayed at the Serrano over the 4th July weekend and loved it. We had booked the room directly through their website, and secured a 'hot dates' rate of $99 per night. We planned to stay in San Franscico for 5 nights as the first leg of our 2-week California stay, so we definitely wanted something not too pricey but hopefully nice. The Serrano definitely fit this criteria. The lobby area of the hotel is interesting  tasteful; I loved the decor of this area (sort of chic vintage Morroccan...perhaps a bit Casablanca-like  old Hollywood), with all sorts of interesting things to look at. The bedrooms had a similar theme and were really quite lovely. Ours was on the fifth floor and didn't have a great view (basically the side of a concrete building) and the room wasn't terribly large, but we didn't spend much time there anyways. Contrary to what other reviews have mentioned, our bathroom was actually quite spacious, although the shelving for toiletries is a little limited (they provided Aveda toiletries, by the way, which was very nice). The tub was fairly deep although I was disappointed because it was a little short for my long legs (I am 5'10)!! The linens on the bed were lovely, I found the bed very comfortable, there was a spacious walk-in closet, terry cloth robes  a huge mirror on the wall by the bed. Although we didn't buy anything (the hotel is less than a block away from a Walgreens), there was a nice selection in the mini-bar.The location of the hotel is actually quite good. Some people have complained about homeless and feeling unsafe, but I think this is a bit ridiculous. This hotel is in a very busy, bustling area of the city, full of shops and restaurants, so as long as you don't stray too far south (and you should be able to tell immediately when you have done so because things start to get shady), you'll be fine. There are always lots of people around, even at night. For breakfast, I would recommend two places: David's Delicatessen (around the corner) and the Taylor St. Coffee Shop (just down the block.) David's is a Jewish deli with 1950's style diner seating, and cooks up a mean set of Fresh Apple Pancakes and Scrambled Eggs with lox...I am getting hungry just thinking about it! But this place is a bit pricey; my boyfriend ate here several mornings with our bill totalling over $30. More reasonably priced (we saved about $10 each time we ate here) is the Taylor St. Coffee Shop. This place is smaller but very friendly. The kitchen is in the open at the front of the restaurant and every member of staff thanked us as we left each morning. My favorite was a super yummy entre of eggs with guacamole, bacon bits, tomato and hashbrowns for $6.99 - great value. Also serve a fantastic fresh OJ. This place has a retro feel with photos of Marilyn, James Dean  other classic stars adorning the walls. But back to the Serrano - I think the excellent staff and the attention to customer service is one of the biggest ways this hotel is a standout. We were ALWAYS greeted by a member of staff upon entering the hotel, and even the staff taking luggage up or downstairs on the elevator were friendly enough to say hello and strike up short conversations. We missed the wine tasting one evening by a few minutes and the concierge overseeing it (didn't catch his name) was nice enough to bring us up our own bottle!!! This hotel has obviously made customer service a top priority and it shows, blowing most hotels I have stayed with out of the water. We would definitely stay here, especially if we secured another 'hot date' rate.","Aug 1, 2006","8","7",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_9264","Fun  As soon as I entered the lobby I was quickly and enthusiastically greeted by 3 different staff!

Had a room on the 17th floor- great view and very quiet! No idea you were in a very large city. Walked home each night after dinner between 10  11 PM and felt very safe. Door men outside kind of watching over everything. The room was comfortable- the bathroom was sort of small- but didn't really spend much time in there!Would definitely consider satying there again!","Jul 11, 2006","7","6",5,5,1,5,1,6,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_2038","not wild about the Serrano Based on the positive reviews and a good rate, my husband  I booked a room for 2 nights over the 4th of July weekend. I knew the rooms were not large and that the bathrooms were tiny. However, I did not expect the disorganization at the check-in desk. We arrived early and decided to see if we could get an early check in. It took 15 minutes for the receptionist to confirm that there were no rooms available yet. We came back just before 3pm (check-n time) and spent another 25 minutes while the receptionist tracked down a room that had been cleaned. The following day we experienced a similar problem. We left at 9am and returned at 3pm only to find that maid service had not yet cleaned our room. She did appear at 3:45 which meant we had to leave the room while she cleaned. Aside from the bellmen, we did not find the staff to be overly friendly. There was coffee and tea served from 7-9am but the urns didn't seem to be replenished often. Both mornings I came downstairs at 8am to find the coffee urn empty.The location is a bit sketchy. I'll give it high marks for being around the block from Dottie's True Blue Cafe. However, it's also on the boarder of the Tenderloin. Needless to say, it's not a great area to walk around after dark.Overall our stay at the Serrano was just OK. We paid $125 a night and basically got what we paid for. With all of the other hotels in San Francisco I caan't really recommend it.","Jul 5, 2006","6","5",4,4,1,3,1,3,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_5632","Cramped and Hectic My fiance and I stayed at the Palomar Hotel on June 19th, 2006. This hotel was great, and I recommend it to anyone. It is centrally located 3 blocks from Union Square and is clean and quiet. The Serrano Hotel, by contrast, although also a Kimpton Hotel, was very disappointing. My negative experience began with the reservationist who booked a King Room for us, I doubly confirmed this because I knew that the city was extremely booked at this time. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk was thoroughly overwhelmed and seemed anxious. She was very rushed and curt. Also, when we arrived we found our room to have only a queen sized bed instead of a king, and the room felt so cramped we were feeling clausterphobic as soon as we walked in. The bathroom was clean, in good working order, and had nice ammenities and fixtures but it too felt cramped. The room we stayed in was on the 4th floor and it was rectangular in shape, the foot of the queen sized bed reached the wall, not leaving much room around it. The comforter has loose threads and appeared worn, and the sheets looked dusty and had lint on them. It was extremely noisy in the area from construction and the windows did not block out any of the noise. We immediately called the front desk to inquire, and they left us on hold for so long that the line disconnected, and when I called again, another woman said the original person was on hold with someone else and she would have them call us back. However, we did not receive a call back for ten minutes so we decided to get out of the room and go to the front desk immediately.When we inquired about why we were given a queen room, we were told that all the king rooms had been booked. I assured her that we had booked a king room and she said there was nothing she could do about it. When I told her that we would like to check out and find another hotel, she said that was fine but that our credit card would be charged anyways for the stay and that there was nothing she could do about it. When I asked to speak with the original reservationist, he did some research and told us that they had no king rooms available, but that one might open up later, but they couldn't promise anything. I explained that he had not told us this from the beginning and that we should be able to leave without getting charged, since it had been their mistake. He finally said the manager would take care of us and let me go. Pam, the fron desk manager, apologized profusely and I overheard her on the phone booking restaurant reservations for a guest and she seemed wonderfully helpful. She was the only positive experience in the 45 minutes I spent in the hotel. All of that being said, if you are willing to spend $215+ during peak season for a small queen room that has a Victorian feel in the lobby, then these are the benefits:*4 blocks to Union Square*Attentive Bellman (At least the one who was there at the time, he was the only one who asked if he could be of any help)*Game tables in the lobby, a fireplace and a restaurant (we did not eat there)*Some of the higher rooms may have nice views, we were told that they did by the reservationist because they have more than 17 floors*Pam, the front desk manager, who seemed very interested in making everyone's stay a great one*Updated bathroom*Victorian feelI would definitely recommend the Hotel Palomar over Serrano, we paid less for more space, better customer service, and awesome amenities. Definitely join Kimpton In Touch before you book a room, it gives you great benefits and a better rate.","Jun 23, 2006","6","6",3,3,1,4,1,3,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_8964","Amazing Experience The Serrano is a great boutique hotel part of the kimpton brand. I stay here often for business, and everytime I get out of the cab I'm greeted very respectfully by the entire staff. Being a small hotel they all remember you and pay attention to details. Pam, Terresa, John, and Abdul (front desk and door men) are fantastic and know the area and hotel very well. I agree that some of the rooms have very small bathrooms. With my kimpton status i generally get upgraded to a suite so it's not a problem for me. The hotel restaurant has marginal food at best. I think the Ponzu needs a renovation, it was great when it opened in 99, but menu/chef need updating.Overall, a great hotel, a great experience.

"hotel_136","hotel_8195","Nice suites with decent view Stayed at Hotel Serrano for 5 nights (Jan. 06). Location is a block or two off of Union Square--ideal for first-time visitors and returnees like me. The suites and exec. king rooms(we peeked in a few) were well laid out, not huge but not small. Our suite had a decent sized living room with a view of the city and a peek of the bay far, far away, very nice to wake up to. The bathroom tub was large, but the bathroom was small and had no counter space (we moved a table in from the living room). This hotel is part of Kimpton chain, with fun bathrobes and Aveda bath amenities in our room. The 24 hour dry sauna was delightful (there's also a small gym and 2 computer terminals for web browsing. Wine was served at 5pm in the lobby, but only pretzels to nibble on. Morning coffee and tea was a nice touch. Staff was helpful and accomodating. We had a BB package that provided an OK (not exciting) continental breakfast at the adjacent restaurant. The only drawback is that the cost of parking (adjacent to hotel or at a different lot across the street) is very costly ($30 per 24 hours). THere is no available neighborhood parking so if you are driving there, be forewarned .","Jan 22, 2006","8","8",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_6144","Nice hotel...but needs to change its parking policy Just got back from the Serrano with my girlfriend. Here is the good:-Nicely decorated room-Helpful Staff sans a rogue bellman :)-Decent location, I know some people were wary of the neighborhood, but everyone we met around the hotel could not have been nicer. -Good view from our room. 16th floor was cool!-Extremely easy check-in and check-out process. The lady checking us out was very patient with us as well.-Honor bar prices actually somewhat reasonable!Now, the bad:-If it had not been for the parking charge, I would have given the Serrano 4 stars. First off, we saw some of the other places were a little cheaper then the hotel...until the bellman made it seem like it would be about the same price to park at the hotel. Silly us, we work in the industry and should not have been hosed like we were, but oh well. Long story short, we ended up paying a total of $44 (Bellman didn't mention the tax or anything, of course) to have the privilege of parking. Oh well, it happens.-The rooms are SO small. I'm certainly not a prude by any means in terms of room size, but this was kind of ridiculous. They make phenomonal use of the room but the size is just unacceptable. Plus, the whole time I was there, I did not see another guest anywhere in the hotel. Again, I work in the hotel and if it is a slow night, open up a couple of your suties and try to get some repeat business. It certainly would have taken the bad taste of the parking charge out of my mouth. Anyway, if you do not have a car and need a decent place to stay for the night by yourself I would recommend it.However, if you have any sort of vehicle or need a room with any sort of size, do not bother with the Serrano.","Dec 27, 2005","10","9",6,3,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_7908","Awesome Service! I visited SF for a conference in May and was looking for a Kimpton hotel that was close to Union Square and reasonably priced. The Serrano exceeded my expectations and the expectations of my fiance, who had stayed at the nearby Kimpton Monaco and was expecting the same level of quality. We stayed in the Executive King suite and unlike many of the other reviews, I felt that the size of the bathroom was fine. The whirlpool tub is wonderful, especially if you have a chance to purchase some Lush bath bombs or bubble bars. The Aveda products were a plus. We were upgraded at no extra charge and given a later check-out time because of the Kimpton policy that states that if you find a cheaper advertised price they will match it as well as give you those perks (upgrade based on availability:-).  One of the nights we stayed there, my fiance called to have flowers delivered on short notice--much to my surprise--and had them delivered before I left for my sessions in the morning. They only charged him the cost of the flowers. The staff was extremely helpful and the business center came in handy when I had a deadline for some paperwork. The gym is fabulous and the overall decor of the hotel engaging. If you get a chance, ask about Dottie's. It is by far the BEST place to have breakfast and is around the corner from the Serrano (ask a doorman for directions). The neighborhood may not be the best, but the hotel more than makes up for it. I will be staying at the Serrano again for the LoveParade and will seriously consider staying there again for all of my subsequent visits to SF.","Sep 2, 2005","8","7",5,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_1754","Good, not great We stayed at Serrano for 2 nights and overall, it was a good experience. When we checked in, hotel's computers were down and they had to unlock the door for us. In the morning, we were supposed to ask for card keys at front desk-- we did that just to end up going back to the front desk twice before we could open the door again. The room was nice and clean but SMALL-- we had hard time finding place to open our suitcases. Free internet was a nice touch (we're geeks and bring laptops everywhere). Valet parking was more expensive than I expected-- $42+ tax, so it was about $45 total. I would not specifically seek out to stay at Serrano again but it is a nice safe bet or a back-up plan if other hotels are taken.","Aug 23, 2005","8","7",3,4,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_9038","June tour visits Serrano We stopped here on 13th June 05. It was a lovely hotel, beautifully decorated and well thought out. We had a standard room which was reasonably sized and well furnished. It was very clean and in an excellent location only 5 minutes walk from Union Square. It really was no problem walking into town, it felt safe and in a popular area.The hotel offered free coffee on a morning and free wine tasting in the evening if you can tear yourself away from the shops for 5pm! The staff were helpful and friendly and there was free use of a business room for internet access if required. Parking was next to the hotel at $22 a day. Turning right out of the hotel entrance and opposite the Hilton is the 'Taylor street' coffee shop that was independently highly rated for its breakfasts. If you like Indian food, we found the Merla next door is also a good place to eat. We would definitely stop here again and would definitely recommend it. To put our review into context, this was part of our June tour of California and New York that included the following hotels, also reviewed on tripadvisor.Sofitel - Los Angeles, Best Western O'cairns - Lompoc, Travel Lodge Monterey Bay, Serrano - San Francisco, Wuksachi Lodge - Sequoia Nat park, Yosemite View Lodge - Yosemite Nat park, Furnace Creek Ranch - Deach Valley, Aladdin - Las Vegas, UN Millennium Plaza - New York","Aug 8, 2005","8","6",4,6,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_7458","A Good Value We are just back from 3 days at the Serrano. Since we go to S.F. 3-4 times a year, we are always searching for a hotel that is a good value and is clean with a polite, courteous staff. The Serrano does all of these things quite nicely. Yes, the rooms are a little small and the bathrooms are tiny. But for the price ($99/night), we didn't expect the Four Seasons. San Francisco is one of the towns we visit where there is so much to do that the hotel really is just a place to lay our heads at the end of the day. We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. For one reason or another, we twice asked that our room be changed. Each time, our request was received and granted in a most polite manner. And as some of the others have pointed out, we also ran into the homeless on the streets, but we usually run into them no matter where we stay in S.F. All things considered, The Serrano Hotel is a good value.","Jul 7, 2005","8","7",6,4,1,5,1,5,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_9908","great stay I stayed at the Serrano in early June for 5 days. I had a wonderful trip.To be fair, the stay started on a low note when I arrived for a late check in to find that they didn't have a room with two doubles as I'd requested. Instead they put me in a room the size of a large walk-in closet with a promise to move me the next day. I went back to the front desk and they promptly switched me to a larger room and arranged to have my bags moved the next day while I was out, with a comped breakfast for the inconvenience.On to the good part - its a great hotel. The rooms (that I ended up in) were a nice size, with a funkier decor than the average chain, and most importantly - very, very clean. The service is excellent - quick, polite and personable. The afternoon wine tasting and tarot readings are a fun touch.As for the area - yes, the hotel is on the border (not in the middle of) one of the less nice areas in town. On the other hand, two blocks in the other direction - along perfectly reasonable streets - puts you in Union Square. What more could you ask for, especially at this price?I highly recommend the Serrano and plan on staying there again.","Jul 4, 2005","6","6",6,5,1,5,1,6,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_6107","Quaint and cute We'd just completed a 5 night stay at the Serrano Hotel. The doorman and concierge were polite and enthusiastic at first, but as the days went on, it diminished. The room was clean and the housekeepers did well making up the room each morning. My only complaint would be that they are a bit stingy on the soaps and shampoos. I had my little dog with me on this trip and she had no trouble adjusting. If you do bring your dog, ask for a room that's not near the elevator so that your dog doesn't get irritated everytime someone comes through. There's wine hour at 5pm each day. Although I never joined in, it seem quite popular with the guests. The neighborhood to one side of the hotel is a bit rough, but if you only walk towards Union Square, it's pretty much ok.All in all, for the price I paid ($110US/night), it's a good value.","Jun 27, 2005","4","2",5,5,1,6,1,4,1,"4","$326"

It has a good location, friendly staff,clean and quiet rooms (our room was on the side facing another building) and comfortable bed. Free internet in the business center is a nice plus as is the complementary afternoon wine reception and chair massages.The only negatives would be the small bathrooms with minimal counter space (pedastal sink) and a shower curtin that tend to blow into the shower giving you an unwanted massage! The pillows are strangely smaller than standard. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Serrano and we would stay there again.","Jun 12, 2005","4","3",6,4,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_4638","A Jewel! My husband and I had a 5 day stay at the Serrano and enjoyed our stay immensely. We mentioned that we were honeymooners (shhh...we always do, that's our little secret tip) and we were upgraded to a suite at no additional charge. The suite was FABULOUS with a separate living area and a humongous bathroom with a jacuzzi tub big enough for two(the tub was a life saver after walking the hills of Frisco!) They also sent us a bottle of wine, which was a very classy touch. The decor and ambiance, both of the lobby and the suite was exceptional. We LOVED wine hour and made sure to never miss it! As far as the negative reviews of the staff, I can say that we never had an incident, and were treated with courtesy and a smile on all counts. The concierge staff, including John and Chad, were also excellent. Restaurants a plenty in the area, we loved Muang Thai next door, next to it was a smaller place that had great breakfasts (cheapest in the area) The only drawback to this hotel is the area, as mentioned in so many previous reviews. In case you do not know, Frisco has a big homeless problem and it seemed that the beggars concentrated in the area immediately surrounding the hotel as well as Union Square, which is close by (4 blocks). There are also several asian massage parlors in the immediate area, and in case you've never run into these, they are simply store fronts for brothels. We even saw a street walker or two, also in the immediate area. Ahem. We never felt threatened, but it definitely was a big turnoff in a otherwise lovely city. TIPS: 1) No need for a taxi from the airport, save $35 and use the BART, it is amazingly clean (UNLIKE our subways in NYC), easy to use and only $5.00 per person. It leaves you directly next to the cable car line in Union Sq and is a 10 minute walk to the hotel. 2) Do NOT rent a car! Parking is insanely expensive and public transportation is very good; I promise, you will not miss having a car (xcept at the end of the day when your feet ache from walking those HILLS!) You can even take a free shuttle bus to Muir Woods and over the Golden Gate bridge! If you must rent a car, rent for a day and do all the things you need a car for (Napa Valley, Carmel, Monterey, Sausalito, etc) 3) Rest up and do the cable car thing EARLY, the lines can be an hour long (Make sure to take the Hyde line, it is the most scenic). You can do Ghiardelli Square, Hyde Pier, Fishermans Wharf AND Alcatraz all in one day, if you get out early enough. WEAR YOUR WALKING SHOES! 4) Book Alcatraz in advance, it sells out quickly. Get the audio tour for a few dollars more, it is well worth it!Have fun and enjoy!!","Jun 7, 2005","16","16",5,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_1149","LOVED IT! We LOVED this hotel- the bathrooms are VERY small which is why I give it a 4 and not 5 but at least it has personality, the staff was FABULOUS and we would go again- If you are looking for spacious and posh, this isn't for you. If you want quaint, well run, clean and can deal with no counter space in the bathroom, this is the place. Wine hour was terrific although crowed, we chose to take our wine to our room- we got an upgrade to a two room suite which was terrific. Be sure to ask when you check in, they gave it to us for 40.00 more than our super low 99.00 hot rate fare we got on their website. Enjoy!","Jun 1, 2005","5","4",6,5,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_8266","Quaint, but crowded. Firstly, we enjoyed our stay at the Serrano. The evening wine reception is a nice break in the day. The rooms and main area are pleasantly furnished and finished. But... The rooms are very small. Our's was a corner room and we really had no extra place to put a thing other than on the bed. Our closet was only slightly larger than the door and not quite as deep as a hanger. We each had 1 small drawer in the cabinet under the TV. Also, O'Farrell Street is on the edge of the Tenderloin which can lead to a large flow of street people. More than that, the garbage trucks use that area for clean up at 7 am on Fri. and Mon., making it even louder than usual. This is not a cookie-cutter hotel, but it has some detractions from ultimate comfort. 5/17/05","May 18, 2005","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_5809","A good boutique Hotel with pluses and minuses The Serrano Hotel is a boutique hotel that is nicely decorated and furnished in a good location with competitive prices. I have some serious reservations about the hotel but overall would recommend it.The location of the Serrano hotel is remarkably mixed. Its immediate surroundings are parking lots, run-down convenience stores, and seedy massage parlors. However, just a block away are several luxury hotels and a small theatre district, so clearly this is not a bad neighborhood. And despite the surroundings I never felt unsafe during my stay here. Also, the Serrano is an excellent location for staging forays into the city. In one direction is Nob hill, about six blocks away (although I warn you, that is six blocks UPHILL) while the Powell street transportation complex (Cable Cars, Surface Street Cars, BART, and City Subway) is about five blocks in the other direction. Also at the Powell street complex is 鈥淪an Francisco Place鈥? which is a gorgeous, very upscale, suburban shopping mall, with a Norstroms and the other usual suspects.The d茅cor of the foyer is elaborate and confused. It seems to be a cross between ancient Egypt and baroque Venice. I found it amusing eye candy when I first entered. Three days later it struck me as a bit labored and depressing. The important thing is that the lobby is bright and clean and pleasantly laid out. There is a bell captain inside to deal with your bags, and valets outside to hail you a cab. Every day there is a happy hour in the foyer. Wines are nice (although, I鈥檓 no connoisseur, just a gleeful alcohol consumer), the food is not鈥攋ust a step up from pretzels and chips.Two elevators plus a service elevator (which I used often) only adequately cover the building. Two very highly recommended features of this hotel is the exercise room and business center. The exercise room has an excellent selection of tread mills and other stationary exercise equipment. It is thoughtfully furnished with ample clean towels鈥攏ice touch. The business center features three web-ready PCs plus a printer and fax machine. Incoming fax are free, and computer usage and moderate paper supplies are free. Outgoing long distance fax charges apply. Note that with only three PCs you might have to wait, but it is better than the no service at all that many other hotels in this price range offer.While the d茅cor of the foyer is quite questionable, upstairs everything is first rate. The corridors and rooms are modestly and elegantly decorated. Everything of course, very clean and well-maintained. As for the rooms themselves, they are small. I had a room with a single king or queen-sized bed and even though I was by myself it felt small. Part of the problem is that they cram a full complement of furniture (chair, desk, wardrobe-entertainment center) without any thought into a small room. The closet was also not full sized. If you鈥檙e looking for a good way to test a relationship, you could do worse than share this room with your significant other.But the real problem with these rooms is the washrooms, they are very small. For those of you who have to have a full-sized tub (and why do you have to have that, huh?) your tub is there and is perfectly fine. The problem is that there is very little room left for the toilet. It is squeezed almost under the sink and mirror. Also, the hotel has made a very serious mistake in placing only a small shelf to set your toiletries on and in selecting a sink that has a banked perimeter so you have to very carefully set anything on the surface of the sink or it will fall off. I鈥檓 warning you, close the toilet seat before you brush your teeth or change your contact lenses. I had a decent view looking North up towards Nob hill. Based on the surroundings, I don鈥檛 believe any side of the hotel is going to offer you great views.The staff was generally helpful and pleasant although not overwhelmingly so. Not a significant positive or negative for the hotel.There is a restaurant on the first floor which serves contemporary cuisine. It is nicely decorated with a helpful wait staff. I had one meal here, vegetable stir fry, which was excellent.Overall, I would stay here again. It is a good location, and a nice place to come home too and the end of the day. The small rooms mean I wouldn鈥檛 want to stay longer than three nights, and I would give serious consideration to sharing these rooms with someone else, even my wife.","May 4, 2005","10","10",5,3,1,6,1,4,1,"4","$326"

My colleagues (at the Hilton) were quite envious when they heard of my complimentary car service, wine tastings, business office and view.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The bell captain wanted to know if this was my first stay and proceeded to explain the hotel to me; wine tasting in the lobby from five to six each evening, a business center and gym (which I didn't visit), high speed internet in the rooms.My room was not large, but well appointed. Even though it was a corner room it was high enough above the street to shut out all by the harshest street noise. Linens were clean and changed regularly, towels were deep and thirsty, and there were complimentary terry bathroobes in the closet, the large kind that embrace you after a shower.I would recommend the hotel to any traveler.","Mar 1, 2005","5","5",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_10250","A Lovely Hotel in the Heart of San Francisco We spent a lovely night at the Serrano. The room was as as nicely decorated as the lobby. It was quiet and dark, even though it was almost adjacent to the elevator. We requested a high floor room and the desk clerk managed to get us a interesting south facing city view on the 11th floor of this 17 floor hotel. The beds were comfortable, maybe a trifle hard. The wine reception actually brought a bunch of people into the lobby, which was fun. At $125 AAA it was a good deal--no place better (rated) was cheaper, and no place cheaper was better. We'd wanted to avoid bringing a car altogether, the best policy in this area. As it was, we brought a car, but were able to park it on the street and leave it there--taking a cab, transit, and walking to get around. Our back up plan was parking in a City garage, which I think would have cost us about $20.This is a good place for those who appreciate pretty older hotels downtown.","Feb 27, 2005","4","4",5,6,1,5,1,5,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_2235","great stay We had a great stay here for the last two nights of our honeymoon. (Oct 11-12, 2004) We chose Serrano b/c we love Kimpton hotels and we had stayed at their Argonaut on our first night in SF. After being in the wine country for a few days we wanted to stay somewhere downtown for our last two nights that was a little cheaper than the Argonaut and more centrally located. The Serrano was just PERFECT for that! When we arrived we noticed that a hotel across the street had some labor union strike going on and the picket line was really LOUD with bullhorns, drums, yelling, etc. We had requested a room high up with a view, but that would have meant we would have been on the side of the hotel facing the picket line. We made a request to change to the opposite side and they were very willing to accomodate. The room was on the small side - but that was not a negative at all in our minds. We loved the complimentary wine hour in the lobby (even after tasting wines all week!). We also just loved the location. So convenient to Union Sq and the theater and restaurants. The doorman and concierge were both fantastic. They arranged for us to get a van shuttle ride to the airport that was 1/2 the price of a taxi. We really had a wonderful stay.

Asked for and received a single smoking room up high, on the 14th floor. It was a corner room with a good view of the skyline. When I asked at check-in where I could watch the telecast of my beloved Steelers, the clerk said someone would call my room. Five minutes later Chad called, told me, and when I saw him in the lobby, he directed me to the sports bar a block and 1/2 away. Thereafter, I was referred to by name. The room was well appointed with a good view, plenty of room for a single person,immaculate bathroom with LARGE towels,and impressive soaps and lotions, bathrobes for use, two papers every morning...The S.F.

"hotel_136","hotel_7595","Overall and enjoyable stay My husband and I stayed here the weekend of Sept. 25 - 28. We checked in at night and headed in the wrong direction to the restaurant where we had reservations. You'll know when you're walking in the 'wrong' direction - more liquer stores, vagrants, sex parlors etc. Walking in the right direction feels much safer. Perhaps we were spoiled by the brand new Onyx hotel of the Kimpton chain in Boston, but the Serrano just seemed a bit worn. From the lobby to the worn carpet, to the room. Our room was clean, small - with the brick wall view (we'd asked for a view). What I like about the Kimpton hotels are the quaint happy hours that allow you to mingle with other hotel guests. There was a massage therapist during one happy hour and a tarot card reader the next. We may try the Monaco next time - also Kimpton but looks a little fresher.","Oct 2, 2004","3","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_136","hotel_4158","Serrano, Quaint, Clean, and Convenient I travelled to San Francisco right after Easter and stayed a week at the Serrano. I loved the experience! As we approached the front desk, the bell boy asked if we wanted white or red - wine, that is. We arrived during their happy hour which is 5-6 pm daily. They serve snacks and wines in the lobby area. There were also free chair massages and a tarot card reader in the lobby.We got a corner room on the 15th floor. Not a stupendous view, but good for the location of the building. The bathroom was stocked with Aveda products and lots of towels. The bathroom does not have a separate vanity area and only one small shelf. The bedding was generous, with blankets, comforters, and a duvet. Several pillows and throw pillows. The king bed was very comfortable.The room was small, and it was difficult to unpack because we had one small closet and only two drawers under the armoire. There are individual thermostats in each room. We liked the fact that we had internet access, but had problems using this service. After helping their corporate people figure this out, we got a complimentary fruit basket as an apology. The hotel has a sister hotel, the Monaco, right around the corner, which has a spa, small pool, sauna, and steam room. Serrano guests can use it free of charge (except for spa services, of course!)Not far from there is Millenium, one of the best gourmet, beautiful organic vegetarian restaurants I have visited. It also has a full bar, featuring organic alcoholic beverages. I took several pictures of the restaurant and even the food (well after most people had left and we had gotten a little tipsy on the organic vodka).I was not put off by the location of the Serrano, it is in the theatre district. We walked to restaurants and the like at night. One budget conscious strategy we employed was buying water, soda, and snacks, taking out some of the honor bar items (temporarily) and stocking our own mini fridge. I so hate to pay more than I have to for common items like that!There is also a sushi restaurant on premises, which was busy most nights. There are plenty of restaurants to walk to and the trolley service is not far from the hotel. Down by Union square there was also a very good pizza walk in/dine in place that had great, cheap pizza, just in case you get the munchies. The concierge recommended it.I would recommend the Serrano to those who would like to visit a smaller hotel with friendly people and nice rooms.

The staff is friendly, and loan out cords for the high speed internet. The gym is serviceable, modern, and clean. There is a computer with networked printer for use.

We got a lovely room on the 15th floor, maybe not huge but also not small. Maybe we got a room upgrade as well, wouldn't know as I have only seen that one room. Yes, the bathroom is a bit on a small side and we could have done with a bit more shelf space but hey, we can survive a few days without. The room itself was immaculate and very clean, it was nice for a change to be in bath/shower area with no black mold marks as are found even in the best hotels. When we arrived, the Lady at the reception, Pam, was busy and a bit dour. In no time though, she cheered up responding to our excitement. It was the end of long working day for her and even I think it is hard to look cheerful 24 hours a day. I don't know where the 'young not white people', who gave a review about them being racially biased were, most of the staff were people of colour, asians or new immigrants. The clientele we could see, was in all shades of colour and age. Maybe our young couple have just encountered a bad day, happens to the best of us. The location was also excellent (if you ignored the seedy direction), we walked everywhere i.e. DO NOT rent a car, besides the parking fees are huge $40.00 incl. tax a day for a taurus. If you must rent or drive up, left on O'farrel street is a much cheaper place, I think about $18.00 for 24 hours.

"hotel_136","hotel_5233","Mannequins staring at you in bed!!!/Creepy Neighborhood I normally stay at the Palomar but it was booked so I stayed at the Serrano since it falls under the Kimpton Group. The lobby was beautiful, the employees were all very pleasant but my room was freaking me out. I stayed in the A.C.T. Geary Theater Suite and it was bizarre to say the least. An old lady mannequin in the bedroom, a garish black and white lifesize photo of some creepy looking actress leaning over my bed which was set up to look like a stage and get this, movie theater seats at the foot of the bed. Too strange. I will admit when I first saw the bedroom I burst into laughter and wondered if I was on some kind of hidden camera show. On a positive note, the Bathroom had a huge bathtub which great. The living room was the Green Room. Lots of theater props and stuff in the living room.I suppose if I was into the theater or smoked alot of dope I would have appreciated this room; I didn't.The neighbordhood, the Tenderloin is downright creepy. Crackheads, crack ******, homeless galore, garbage on the sidewalk, in the streets.Wouldn't recommend it due to the area for women or the elderly due to safety reasons.","Apr 16, 2004","4","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"
"hotel_136","hotel_2642","Nice Hotel, Okay location... I liked this hotel, the beds were very comfortable, the staff was very nice and accommodating and the bathrooms (and bathrobes) were great. The location of the hotel is okay for daytime sightseeing - you can walk to the cable cars and downtown shopping. Night time is slightly different. The restaurant attached to the hotel seemed somewhat pricey and there are few options to walk to. If you go in one direction (east I think?) it starts to get a little seedy. That said, we found a perfectly reasonable irish style pub a few blocks away for drinks one night, that was great. Overall, I liked this hotel. Sure the rooms arent extra large but I would rather have quality over quantity any day. I would defintely stay here or in a sister hotel again.","Jan 13, 2004","0","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$326"

"hotel_143","hotel_6451","Beautiful views, lacking details.. Had I been traveling for business, this would be an excellent place to stay. The rooms and hotel have really been designed with the business traveler in mind. The hotel is very modern and stylish and has a comfy bed. This hotel does call itself 'financial district', but it is really more Chinatown/North Beach. It is pretty much the end of the financial district, so you may want to see if it really is close to where you need to be.Pros: Nice room layout, good bed, GREAT views, newly renovated with all the standard amenities of a 4 star hotel, complimentary Internet and large desk/work spaceCons: Ridiculous parking charges ($50, I lived in S.F. for years, this is NOT standard, park across the street for HALF), slow valet (call way ahead to get your car), not convenient to many financial dist. areas, bathroom was more 3 star (standard), had free soap, etc and pay choice...at a 4 star? tacky!, missing light bulbs, broken iron, unplugged lamps and old TV. Oh, and a rude and unfriendly desk clerk who gave me a double (after asking for a king), and rolled her eyes at me when I returned to switchI would stay here again, but would park elsewhere and arrive early enough to inspect my room before bed to be sure I had proper lighting and a working iron.

"hotel_143","hotel_5111","Nice digs Super nice accommodations. Remodeled less than three years ago, the Hilton's got a luxurious, clean, contemporary feel now. The outside still looks like a Soviet fortress, but who cares? The beds feature beautiful linens, feather beds, down comforters and pillows, and European-style duvets. Everything felt clean and new. Great service all around, from the parking attendant to the concierge. I thought I was in a major jam when I realized I had forgotten to pack a couple basic personal care items and I didn't have time to run to the drug store before catching a ferry. A quick flip through Hilton's guest book revealed their Forgot to Pack service, which offers dozens of toiletries at no cost. Room service delivered my items in five minutes!My major complaint: *tons* of street noise. Even on the 10th floor we could hear conversations from the sidewalk below, the trash collection early in the morning sounded like it was right outside our window, and when a Harley went by it felt like we were inside the tailpipe. Maybe there is something going on with the outside acoustics here...Here's a tip: hotels in the business district aren't busy on the weekends. We went on priceline and bid $99/night for four-star hotels in this area; priceline counter-offered at $120/night and we were in business. Compare to $300/night on hilton's website.","Nov 18, 2008","0","0",6,6,5,6,5,6,6,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_5219","Great hotel This is a great hotel. Any hotel in San Francisco is going to be a little loud. The cars always seem to be honking at something. Yes, I could hear people in the next room. It didn't bother me. I always sleep with ear plugs at any hotel. I stayed on the 25th floor which gave me access to the concierge lounge. Breakfast was great every day. Not alot of variety from day to day, but plenty to choose from; cereal, bagels, muffins, english muffins, lots of fresh fruit, orange juice, cranberry juice, coffee. In the evening they had some vegetables, dip, cheese, bread, crackers, coke, sprite, water,  a hot appetizer. Enough for a light snack dinner. My room was very functional and clean. The beds are VERY comfortable. Even though this is literally right next to China town it is really in a great location. Columbus street is just a block away with plenty of public transportation and GREAT food. A great bonus was that the hotel offered a town car for transportation in the morning - free of charge (of course a tip is generally expected). I would definitely stay here again.","Nov 1, 2008","0","0",6,6,5,6,5,6,6,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_2084","Location and Decor Trump All Stayed here for a conference, and came away with a positive feeling about the hotel. The hotel is located right next to Chinatown, so if you like Chinese food, you'll be in hog heaven here. Be sure to try the Dim Sum for lunch at the Imperial Palace - we had it two days in a row. Also went to the Empress for dinner... about a block away.I took the Super Shuttle to and from the hotel from SFO for $17 plus tip. Never needed a car during my three day stay... plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance.The room (813) was nicely furnished and decorated, with good use of relatively small square footage. A picture window spanned the entire wall, and a desk ran the length of the window. My room had a great view of Coit Tower and occasionally San Francisco Bay off in the distance. This room still had an old style TV, instead of the flat screens which seem to be more and more common. There were a few relatively minor maintenance issues with the room, but nothing I couldn't live with. These included a black-out curtain that was ripped and repaired with a Band-Aid, a phone that didn't work (the other one had assorted single call buttons, none of which were functional), and some struggles with the heater, which seemed locked on an unusually cool 70 degrees. The shower took a little getting used to, since the shower head was only shoulder high (I'm six feet tall).I'd characterize the front desk service as competent, but not overly service oriented. No valet greeted me upon arrival... I got the impression they were really busy with conference attendees (ours and others). Room service for dinner was very good the first night (Pacific salmon), but only so-so the last night (a parsimonious club sandwich). The folks who delivered it, though, were very pleasant and efficient. My room had a single cup Lavazza coffee maker, and each day I was provided with a single supply of caffeinated coffee and one of decaf. One cup just isn't enough for me in the morning... I needed more. Despite the relatively minor problems, the location and decor trumped all. I'd have no problem returning here next time I'm in San Francisco.","Nov 1, 2008","1","1",5,5,6,5,4,5,1,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_3791","Fantastics views in San Francisco Good Hotel. Advertised as a business hotel which I guess means small lobby. My Hilton Honors card must have worked, because I was upgraded to top floor (27) which has a balcony and great view of SF harbor and Coit tower. Room was well done, nice amenity kit, and this floor had free internet (I do not think it is free on other floors). Front desk was very friendly. Housekeeping left thank you note for pillow tip. Close to China Town, and public transportation is easy, but not short walk to much else. Avoid bringing a car into SF because it will be a hassle. Overnight parking in the hotel is $48, and $24 in the public parking structure across the street. If you get a good rate, this is a good hotel I would recommend, even without floor 27.","Oct 30, 2008","0","0",6,5,4,6,6,6,1,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_4245","Not Your Uncle's Hilton The drab architecture of the building itself is the only evidence that this used to be a Holiday Inn. The rooms and common areas have been completely redone and now look more like an upscale boutique hotel.The rooms have been redesigned in a very modern but warm decor. The best part is the long desk that lines the window so that you are easily distracted by a great view. I usually prefer wired internet access as I almost always have signal strength and consistency problems with wireless, but not here. Good strong signal at all times. The Japanese style sliding door to the bathroom was one of the best I've seen as there was almost no space along the sides - a common problem that hampers privacy if sharing the room. A comfortable bed was complimented by a stylish chaise lounge.I did not spend much time in the hotel itself but was impressed with the design of the lobby and the food and retail outlets. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Room service breakfast was pricey but tasty and on time.One of the best things about this hotel is it's location. It is sandwiched by Chinatown and the Financial District, and only one block away from RG Lounge and House of Nanking - two Chinatown favorites. A short walk takes you further into Chinatown or to North Beach.Lastly, all the reviews I read about excessive noise had worried me, but I was not disturbed - by internal or external noise - one iota. I did notice that the ice machine was very loud so had I been in the room next to it I might have thought differently.","Oct 26, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,5,5,5,5,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_5849","OK, nothing more nothing less Visited San Francisco at a busy time of year so booked the Hilton as it was a good deal.I've stayed at the O'Farrell St Hilton before and was really pleased with it. This Hilton is not so good.To begin, it is on a run down street on the edge of Chinatown and the Financial District. The street is pretty grotty with some closed down shops nearby. On a positive it is only a couple of blocks from some of the trams and one block to Chinatown and the business area.The building itself is pretty grim, grey concrete. Reception is OK but obviously not a high end Hilton.We received a welcome note advising that should we choose to check out early a USD100 'admin' charge would be applied. I don't know if this is a new Hilton policy but it's not one I've seen before.Room was OK, small but OK. Bathroom tiny but again OK and clean.Beware the light sleepers, the sound proofing is not great.Overall the hotel was OK, pretty bland but OK.On returning I noticed a USD6.50 charge on my card (interestingly the cost of a bottle of water in your room). I have queried this (I know USD6.50 isn't much but hey it's still money I do not owe them). They have promised to refund the money but it still leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.Would I reccommend this hotel? It depends, as I said it's OK but there are certainly better hotels out there, including the Hilton San Francisco.","Oct 25, 2008","1","0",4,4,3,5,4,5,1,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_10565","Very disappointed.... First time of my life booking through priceline. I requested a king, non-smoking room. Upon arrival, the man who checked us in said in a very arrogant voice, Even though you prepaid for you stay through priceline discounters, I still need a credit card for incidentals. When I asked if we had a nice room, he said, Since you booked through priceline, you will get our run of the house.....When we arrived at our room, we found out that he put us in a double/double room. My husband  I were on a romantic weekend away  we really didn't want to end our first-ever trip to CA in a double/double room. I called downstairs to talk to the same man. He said, We are completely booked. Not one room to spare. And because you booked through priceline, there is no guarantee of a king room. I hung up and called the hotel (not their 800#, but the hotel #) directly from my cell. I asked for the reservations department. The lady told me that they had both regular king rooms and club king rooms available for that night.I hung up my cell  called the manager of the hotel from the room phone.After 3 conversations, she finally agreed to move us to a king room. At first, she wanted me to pay $40 instead of the usual $50 to get a king. I refused. She finally gave in  moved us without charging us an extra fee.Well, the first toom wasn't spectacular.The king room was horrible. It had a small window in the corner. Even with the lights turned on in the room, it was very dark. The TV worked for a bit, then stopped altogether.I will NEVER, EVER stay at a Hilton again after this negative experience.","Oct 16, 2008","3","3",2,2,4,3,2,2,1,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_9630","Great location, comfy beds The hotel is in Chinatown more so than the financial district and just a couple of blocks away from little Italy which is great! The rooms were quite nice, the beds great! The bathroom was unique with a sliding door. If you're sharing with someone you don't know well this could get tricky, there's no lock on the door and it doesn't always close well. Other than the bathroom door, the ony other complaint I have is the elevators. I went as a member of dragon boat team and tons of other teams were there as well. Having only 4 elevators for 20+ floors did prove to be challenging for the number of people coming and going on a regular basis. I walked the stairs a few times to the 9th floor and actually made up there before others who took the elevator.I stayed 4 nights and enjoyed the hotel. We got a good rate since it was a large group. I stayed 4 additional nights in SF at The Donatello which was quite good as well, very different location.

"hotel_143","hotel_4887","Mixed - good and bad I stayed at the Hilton Financial District (actually Chinatown) for almost a week while in SF for a conference. Hotel was nice and clean. I'm a Hilton Honors member and had a non-smoking bay view king room reserved. I checked in at 3:30 and was told there were no more bay view rooms available. That's fine, I wasn't going to be in the room very much. The person checking me in put me in a tiny room next to the maid's closet and it wreaked of cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. I went back to the lobby, waited 15 minutes, was told no one had smoked in the room, but finally convinced them I was not going to stay in a smokey room and demanded a non-smoking room. He gave me another room, telling me it was their last non-smoking room, and luckily it turned out to be fine, though being on a low floor looking over the parking structure wasn't exactly what I was expecting. But, it was clean and fairly quiet. Ironically, people checking in after me, going to the same conference, got non-smoking bay view rooms on high floors and they weren't even Hilton Honors members. They did check in w/ a different person so maybe the guy I got was just being a jerk or having a bad day. For the most part, their staff was pretty friendly though the waitress at breakfast acted like bringing us juice and water was inconveniencing her. I'd recommend the small Chinese restaurant next door for breakfast, nothing frilly, but good food for a great price. The food at the Hilton is way over priced, especially for the breakfast buffet w/ it's cold stale waffles and no cooked to order eggs, just scrambled eggs. Overall, it's an ok hotel. I probably would not stay there again though due to the initial room problem I had and because they allow smoking in some of their rooms, better to go w/ a smoke-free hotel if you are a non-smoker like I am.","Oct 14, 2008","0","0",3,3,4,6,3,4,5,"4","$236"

This has to be one of the noisiest hotels I've ever tried to sleep in. There is no such thing as a good night's rest in any of the rooms. You are surrounded by noise... your neighbors (As the previous posters stated, you can hear EVERY sound! The walls are paper-thin.), the elevators (There are four and they are constantly in motion.), the street noise, the car alarms, the school across the street which has recess continuously throughout the day (Try taking a nap between the bells, basketballs, and jump rope chants!), the police/fire station, and the homeless and drunks that continuously patrol the streets. Oh, and let's not forget the protests that happen across the street almost every time I've been here.Not only that but the management just doesn't care. At least, not when it comes to crew members. I thought their rudeness was only directed at us until I read numerous other postings online. Now, I feel a bit better. Also, as for amenities, it'd be nice to have the option of a refrigerator in my room or the ability to store my cooler in a walk-in refrigerator (Hotels I frequent are more than accomodating.) Once, I inquired about a pool or hot tub and they mentioned the car wash in the basement. I thought, well, that might be fun but, apparently, you're not able to cool off in that, either! lolAll in all, there are many, MANY other options in the neighborhood that are in the same price range that offer a sound night's sleep.

"hotel_143","hotel_3933","Avoid at all costs On arriving at the Hilton Hotel, Financial District in San Francisco, it seems perfectly situated between touristy Chinatown and the Financial District. With on-site spa, roof pool, restaurant and friendly consierge, one would think that due to price you'd gotten yourself a great deal, but just wait until you attempt to put your head on the pillow and get some sleep....The windows in this busy downtown hotel have not been upgraded since it was a Holiday Inn in the Sixties, so guests, regardless of how high up they are in the 28 floors are treated to the drunken screams, car alarms and emergency vehicle wails until at least three in the morning.Our personal experience did not end there- we were in a room that had the possibility to be adjoined- we heard every peep, every bowel movement, every pillow wrussle and cell phone discussion about the occupant's brother's STD. UNTIL 5.30 IN THE MORNING.If and when they moved out into the hall it was just as loud, and accompanied by the precussive noise of their door slamming shut due to poor maintenance. When I finally complained, the only solution they offered was to move us to another room- so we can wake up, pack up our stuff, and settle in to a new set of equally noisy neighbors? This was supposed to be a romantic getaway, and so when my fiance refused the new room, the night desk clerk suggested I take up the offer for a new room myself. It's supposed to be a romantic getaway, you idiot!I demanded from the desk clerk that the moment that we checked out, I wanted a word with the manager- not only did they not bring forth the manager, they didn't even bother to ask how our stay was when we did. There wasn't enough time to make a stink about the situation, so I pass this logic on to you, the good readers of tripadvisor.Conrad Hilton, the founder of the Hilton Group, said that above all, the credo of his company was Be Hospitable. This is was the opposite of hospitable. Let 'em have it with both guns and don't give up until you get all your money back. After reading the comments on this site, I'm skipping the management who obviously don't give two figs about their customers, and instead and going straight to corporate. I'll keep you abreast on how well I do getting my money back.just do yourself a favor- by all means, don't stay here.

"hotel_143","hotel_6166","Nice but you may not sleep much I brough the wife and kids here for one night (a friday) on our way to another destination. The pros: great location (across the street from chinatown, walking distance to union square shopping, you can catch a cable car to fisherman's wharf). The room was nice, clean and modern w/plasma flat screen. As a Hilton Diamond member I was upgraded to a concierge floor with free continental breakfast, which was nice. Staff is friendly and attentive.The cons: the room was a bit small and cramped, the afore-mentioned steam problem from the shower, the bathroom door is a modern japanese-style slider so no real visual or sound privacy (you can peek in on each side of the door (1/4 opening). But the biggest con of all was the lack of sleep due to sound disturbances. The walls must be paper thin as I could hear a businessman yapping in mandarin in the next room starting at 5am, as if he was in the bed with me. This - after being kept up by the sound of a DJ and people partying from some nightclub until 2am (the sound echoed all the way up to the 26th floor due to the close proximity of the buildings). Needless to say we did NOT get a good night's rest. I would recommend this hotel for a couple without kids who plan to stay up late partying (and hopefully you won't be woken up by the sound of mandarin at 5am). :)","Sep 22, 2008","0","0",4,5,5,5,5,5,5,"4","$236"

The room was exactly as the photo on the Hilton website, modern, immactlately clean, well decorated, with the most comfiest king size bed, with crisp egyptian cotton sheets. Bathroom was compact but it had everything you need and was topped up daily. Tea/Coffee making facilities, No mini bar, but complimentary bottled water, and an ice bucket for the ice dispenser next to the lifts on each floor. Free internet access and flat screen tv's, Front Desk  Concierge service was very efficient at getting taxi's etc. The hotel Bar was very expensive for drinks.Location was great for North Beach and China Town, lots of great restaurants, try Momma's on Washington Square for breakfast - amazing! its a short walk but well worth it. Try the Stinking Rose for Dinner on Columbus Ave, closest to hotel was Francis Ford Coppola's Restaurant Zoetroupe one block up from the hotel - amazing food and wine, and reasonably priced.Short walk 20 mins to Union Square and all the big stores, on the bus route to the Marina district and easy reach walking to Pier 39, Fishermans Wharf etc. I'd recommend it to anyone.

The room was smallish, but pretty nicely upgraded, with flat screen TV, etc. As a previous reviewer already mentioned, the windows are still single pane, so there is definitely traffic and city noise especially during weekend nights.

"hotel_143","hotel_4235","Amazing Staff, Great Room I like both an overall review and details when I use this site, so I'll do both here.HILTON STAFF WERE AMAZINGThe staff at this hotel were wonderful. Scott in reservations was incredibly gracious to us when we were in a bind and made magic happen before we even arrived. He saved our trip.The rest of the staff had the same can do attitude, from checking in to constantly being greeting in the elevators and hallways, all the way to the end when we retrieved our bags.ROOMS WERE GREATThe rooms were also nice, well appointed. The bathroom and closet area is a little tight but a small thing considering all the views. Our friends had an AMAZING view of the bay and downtown. We also had so much fun with the views. I love to people watch down on the street; this view afforded that opportunity. The bed was medium in terms of firmness and the pillows a mix of feather and non. All very nice.There was a long desk area by the window and a chair with ottoman by the bathroom wall so, plenty of places to lounge and store things.We are light sleepers but were a little surprised by the road noise, especially bc we were on one of the highest floors. However, turning the AC unit to on, playing music and/or using ear plugs solved the problem.FITNESS = FUNThe amenities were great as well. Being into hotel fitness centers, I was elated at how nice this one was! Treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, etc. Even apples and water in the room, all with a great view in front of you.LOCATION WAS IDEALThe location was perfect for us. Chinatown is right there with plenty of restaurants. We ate at E Tutto Qua which is .2 miles from the hotel and it was lovely. Not a bad walk to Union Square, the BART, etc. Just enough away from all the big touristy areas. We walked the whole time from the hotel, only taking a cab once and the BART to and from SFO. It's a great location.OVERALL - THANK YOU, HILTON!This was a great stay. All six of us in our group had a wonderful time. It was always nice to go back to our rooms each day after playing hard.

"hotel_143","hotel_6939","Good hotel, location is a bit inaccurate I had a one night stay here before having to transfer to a hotel in San Jose for logistical reasons. My company travel agent booked it for $209. You can't miss the building. Its a large garish brutalist style tower in Chinatown.Location: The travel agent booked it for me based on the price and the 'financial district' location. The hotel is really in the heart of Chinatown. For that reason, if you aren't terribly cost conscious, I recommend the airport shuttles to get to the hotel. They are about $17. BART is less and will get you to Montgomery Street Station, but its a bit of a hike to the hotel especially if you have luggage. Other than that, its well placed for a visit to the city, tourism or business.Check in: Quick and efficient. I arrived early and the hotel was able to accomodate me. I was able to get the room type requested without any fuss.The room: Good. Large work desk area and...free wireless internet! Nice to see there is one hotel that doesn't nickel and dime you for internet service. Bed was very comfortable. TV is a bit dated. Another note is that if you are taller than six feet, you may find the shower a bit of a problem. I am 5'6'' and its a low shower. Overall though, the room was quite nice and relatively comfortable.Amenities: Since it was only one night, I didn't have a chance to try everything out. I asked the staff if there was a place to get a breakfast sandwich in the AM. Nothing in the hotel. There is a sit down restaurant, but that's it. I had to walk down to Specialty Bakery about two blocks away to grab a quick bite before work.Overall, I liked the hotel, except for the location. If I was planning to be in SF for more than a couple of days, I would definitely want easier access to BART and Muni to get around.","Jul 25, 2008","0","0",4,5,4,6,6,5,6,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_8477","Nice stay We moved to Hilton Financial District after a couple of nights stay at Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf. It was a good decision to move to downtown hotel, it felt like visiting a completely new city! There are two Hiltons in SF downtown, and I chose this one based on the financial district addition to its name which is a bit cheeky since it is in fact in chinatown. the hotel is a few blocks away from Union square shopping central, we did not mind the nice walk to and from the hotel. We got a corner room with lovely Coit tower view, but the room was small and we felt a bit cramped due to a very narrow window which makes the room dark and gloomy. seems the hotel was recently renovated, interiors are nice and the bed is very comfortable. Overall our stay was nice but it didn't make a special impression, it's a good hotel of Hilton standard. just adequate for comfortable stay and we'll still recommend it. although we don't mind returning, we'll probably try another hotel for our next visit.","Jul 11, 2008","0","0",4,4,4,5,5,4,5,"4","$236"

Only downsides are the windows are not sealed well, so street noise is an issue; hotel restaurant is lack luster, and room service way overpriced.

As soon as we arrived we knew instinctively that we had made a good choice.Room was large with a huge bed and luxurious bathroom.As soon as we arrived and were happy with the accommodation we walked down to Fisherman's Wharf (a good 30 minute walk) and spent the rest of the afternoon in the glorious sunshine soaking up the atmosphere. The sea lions were adorable but the smell was pretty unique to say the least!The situation of the hotel right on the edge of Chinatown was superb. Most evenings we walked down into North Beach to Vesuvio's, where on our first evening we had a minor earthquake! We ate at tiny cafe's/restaurants in Chinatown for a few pounds.We walked, and walked and walked. Care should be taken not to stray into unsafe areas as this is pretty easy to do. A good map is a must, and it is advisable to know beforehand where you should go and where you should avoid. Try to avoid the Tenderloin and parts of Market Street, but even with our prior knowledge we still managed to find ourselves surrounded by pretty scary individuals in Market Street.We also booked a day trip that took us around the city, over the Golden Gate Bridge and included a trip to Alcatraz. We also wandered up to Coit Tower and Lombard Street, and spent the best part of a day in Golden Gate Park.I wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again.","Jul 4, 2008","0","0",5,6,6,6,6,5,1,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_3147","Decent hotel - great location, but there are better hotels... We booked at the Hilton based on a bargain rate found on Orbitz. While the name notes that the hotel is in the Financial District, it is better to situate this hotel in Chinatown.It's a short walk to North Beach and Market Street, which makes the location hard to beat.The lobby is gorgeous: very modern, Japanese-influenced style. We stayed in a standard king room with a city view. The room was very small, but modern. We spent little time in the hotel, so we did not mind the cramped space. I would not pay the full rate suggested for this hotel, as there are so many options around San Francisco.Bathrooms have no fan, so beware of your showers setting off smoke alarms from the steam!

"hotel_143","hotel_4941","This used to be that nasty Holiday Inn! I visit San Francisco from time to time, and my company has recently relocated our office in the city to a location near this hotel - and I just completed my first stay there.When I got to the hotel I was very pleased with the visual experience - the hotel is lovely, and the bell staff through the entire stay was a pleasure.It was a strange visit though. As I unpacked in my room I looked out the window and saw a view I know I had seen before. I figured it was just deja-vu, because the only time I had ever been in this area before it was ten years ago, and I had stayed at the Holiday Inn - and that place was SO bad that I checked out the second night. It was bad on a grand scale - like huge hotel awful bad. It wasn't until the next night when I was talking to the bell desk guys that it hit me - I was looking at the same view because I was in the same physical building! If you ever stayed at the awful old Holiday Inn, I highly recommend stopping by the Hilton - the renovation is nothing short of miraculous. I chatted at length with the hotel staff during my stay about it - many of them had worked at the hotel when it was a Holiday Inn, and they all found it amusing that I hadn't realized for a full day that I was in the same place.My only ding against the hotel was that the service was a bit off. When I checked in, the front-desk manager asked me why I had requested foam pillows (I do so because I'm allergic to feathers). She then let me know that I should add that to my profile, because they normally don't honor the request unless it is clearly called out that the person has allergies. She promptly called the room staff to rotate my pillows and make my room feather free - but this was never done. Also, the last evening I was there the staff failed to pick up my breakfast card from the door, and I didn't realize this until I had expected my breakfast. To their credit, they had me breakfast in the room within 6 minutes from me calling down - sans toast - but it was a good effort nonetheless.While the service was a bit uneven, it was a very pleasant stay, and I will definitely be back. The staff was very friendly across the board - among the friendliest I've seen in a Hilton this large. The views are still great, and the rooms are fresh, clean, and comfortable.","May 1, 2008","2","2",5,5,5,6,5,5,6,"4","$236"

We had a very comfortable room, with normal Hilton amenities and a nice view over to the harbour.

The rooms are good if on the smaller side - not bad, not spectacular.Unless you have free breakfast, it really doesn't make sense to eat there for $20. The Executive Lounge is closed for the weekend but you get the free breakfast at their restaurant if you're with Hilton Honors.

I did call a few days ahead and mentioned we'd be celebrating our wedding anniversary in SF and requested a bay view room possibly on a top floor--- with 2 beds. Since we book the room via Priceline--- my request was noted, but was informed it may not a sure thing at check-in. When we arrived at the hotel after a very long flight from Massachusetts--- we were greeted warmly by Gemma who quickly checked us in, wished us a happy anniversary, and gave us a beautiful room on the 21st floor with a breath taking view of the SF Bay, Coit Tower, and North Beach. The room was small but modern and compact and comfortable. We had breakfast every morning at the Garden Restaurant next store to the HIlton. It's a Chinese Restaurant that serves a very hearty ( omelet, hash browns, toast, coffee) and inexpensive breakfast option---either Chinese or American breakfast choices. The location of this Hilton made it the perfect location to walk everywhere: North Beach, Embacadero/Ferry Building, or Union Square. We also bought a 3 day MUNI pass that allowed us to take busses or cable cars to explore Golden Gate Park ,the Presidio and Crissy Fields.

"hotel_143","hotel_8974","One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in From the start this hotel was terrible. Check-in was overly protracted and carried out by a man with an attitude who didn't like the fact that I had made multiple bookings over my stay. I was told that I would have to check out and back in again at the end of each booking (service hey!). This guy who has no understanding of customer service ignored my questions and proceeded to answer the 'phone when dealing with me (sure, I don't mind waiting after my 13 hour flight). It got worse when he told me the room was not ready - it was 9.30pm (not am!)! The room was more representative of a 1 star hotel...it was inconceivable that the windows were not double glazed and it was possible to hear all sorts of noises outside from traffic, to screaming children, bottles being emptied from the bar and trash vehicles loading up (all night). Desk staff told me there was no chance of a room change. However, when I spoke to the only human being at the hotel - Kristina from Norway, she said I could change room the next day. I didn't sleep that first night but of course, they don't offer a refund. The second room was better, but still had some issues. There was a beautiful view of the San Francisco bay, but still no double glazing of course, so noise was still quite loud...no as bad as the previous room though and with earplugs (which were trashed by the housekeeping staff the next day!) I managed to get some sleep. I had paid for a room on the club floor. Don't bother! The only material difference is a flat screen TV. Inclusive access to the conceirge lounge means nothing. The lounge is simply a single guest room transformed into something worse than the cheapest Best Western, it was crammed and full of children. As a business traveller I expected better, but ended up eating the horrid breakfast (no choice - just a few croissants) on my lap. I asked the next day if I could have breakfast elsewhere and was given vouchers to do so in the main restaurant. The service was the same as in the remainder of the hotel...took 12 minutes to get a coffee and you must flag staff down to get it...they are so engrossed in their gossip chats that they obviously forget the customer. Many guests noticed this and although it did not take 12 minutes to flag down the staff for coffee everyday, they did require flagging every day!On the weekend, the club floor lounge does not open at all. It seems that the club floor rooms go to just anybody too. I wanted the club room as I have to work. Impossible, it was so noisy with group meetings/music next door and kids running around all afternoon upstairs. Despite 2 calls to the front desk nothing happened and I barely got my work done...A couple of other points to note: no minibar; very very limited room service both in terms of choice and hours of operation; they will not allow you to borrow electricity convertors...you have to purchase for $25 - I have never ever experienced this in any hotel I have stayed in during my years of worldwide travel.My advice is do not stay in this hotel under any circumstance you will only be disappointed....if you do, don't bother to pay the extra for a club room...it's just a label that means very little....chances are if you book a regular room you'll get upgraded to club anyhow, especially at the weekend!I leave tomorrow and can't wait to get out of here. For Hilton I would say it's the worst hotel I have ever stayed in...it offers nothing and gives poor service and memories.","Apr 13, 2008","7","4",2,2,5,4,2,2,2,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_10604","View Fit for a President First, I have to say that up until last year, I lived in San Francisco for five years so I do know the city.We arrived at 10 AM and wanted a king no smoking. Since we were so early, we said we would just wander through Chinatown which is just blocks away and come back after lunch. The concierge is fantastic and friendly. He was helping people check out, giving families with kids great ideas of things to do, and recommending places for lunch. He was right there by the registration desk. No problem with him being unapproachable. I even asked him for a lunch idea. (It was great and had been a Rachael Ray recommended restaurant)After lunch, we returned to the hotel to see if a room was ready. They still didn't and when I mentioned that we had been there since 10, the front desk person said that she would upgrade us since we had been waiting a few hours. Upgrade she did, to the 27th floor. I opened the door and my jaw dropped. Straight in front of us was an unobstructed view of Coit Tower, Alcatraz, Angel Island, North Beach, etc. In all my years in SF, this was one of the best views I have ever seen. You do not have to be that high to get this view either, but if you can afford the upgrade, it is worth it. This hotel is completely remodeled and it is very well done.On the following day, while waiting for a car to take us back to the airport, security tightened, and we were not sure what was going on. Just then, an entourage of people in dark suits started to pass by us. Senator McCann was checking in. He walked by me and we shook hands and I wished him luck in his campaign. I bet he liked his view from his room.","Apr 4, 2008","0","0",5,5,6,5,6,6,6,"4","$236"

Hotel rates are also pretty good, compared to similar hotels in other SF areas.The hotel itself is good. It is a 'normal' business hotel, but still a nice place to stay. The rooms must have been recently refurbished: they looked very good and seemed newer then what you would exepect from the outside of the hotel :-)The room was nicely decorated and was very comfortable. Bathroom was clean, although not too big. Which was ok for me since I stayed alone (business trip).Bar is a great area, lobby is almost non-existing.

The room and bathroom was large enough for two people and the views were amazing from the 26th floor!

"hotel_143","hotel_6139","Terrible Service We were there for three nights. The rooms were over priced for the service we were receiving. We paid about an average of USD350 per night. I was there with a family of 7 and we booked three rooms. One room had no safe at all. When we requested for a change, the receptionist asked us to change within ourselves - as if the rest of us do not require a safe in the room. One room did not even have a chair and when ordered room service, we had to eat on the bed. Another room's amenities were not equipped fully. The customer hotline was not working, and nobody answered the phone when we called the reception. When we told the receptionist that there was no one answering the customer hotline button, they did not even know the button exists! On our last day checking out, we called for the bell service to get out luggages down. We waited 15 minutes and decided to go down to the reception only to find out that the concierge was not informed that we needed out luggages brought down. We booked a cab from the hotel to get to the airport. When we waited and there was no cab in sight, we checked with the receptionist and they answered, Just pass them the voucher. It's not our problem. To which we replied, You didn't even tell us what the cab would look like or the number plate. How should we know which one is it? Generally, the employees there were very rude and unhelpful. I did not enjoy my stay at the hotel at all.","Mar 11, 2008","1","0",2,4,5,4,2,2,4,"4","$236"

Valet parking is $47 a day, which is bordering on absurd. I parked the car myself in the same lot the second day for $25. They did charge me for 2 days of valet parking, but corrected the bill without any question. I didn't fond the rooms to be so small. Every room seems to have a great view.

"hotel_143","hotel_7510","Clean, comfortable, great view We stayed in a deluxe king bay view on the 22nd floor. The room was on the smallish side, but was very cozy, comfortable and clean. The bed was crisp and inviting. Our view was spectacular: coit tower in front with the bay on either side. The bathroom was small and uninspiring, but adequate for a short stay. The shower had good water pressure and was a welcomed respite after a day or evening out in the city. Other posters had mentioned an issue with noise, even on the higher floors. We did hear a quiet hum of city noise in our room, although it was not bothersome in the least. The only annoyances were the occasional sirens and horns blaring in the streets below. For some reason, that type of sound traveled up very clearly and at times, like during the middle of the night, sounded as if they were right outside of our room. The lobby, except for the immediate entrance which had a couple of bright and airy seating areas, was modern but cold and uninviting. The front desk staff were fine, but not overly friendly. The concierge desk was friendly and well meaning but not highly knowledgable. Our most positive encounter with staff, however, was with a housekeeper that we passed in the hall next to our room as we were getting ready to check out. She greeted us so warmly that it left us with a very positive feeling. Overall we would certainly consider staying here again.","Mar 7, 2008","1","1",5,5,5,5,4,4,1,"4","$236"

Great location too...within walking distance of Union Sq. and the Embarcadero/Ferry Bldg. The hotel is practically in Chinatown, so you're near that and pretty close to North Beach (Little Italy) too. Only negative point might be the expensive parking. I ended up using a different lot that was cheaper and literally only a block away from the hotel.

"hotel_143","hotel_7315","Small room, big fun I felt like this hotel was inexpensive for a purportedly 4 * hotel in SF. We had a rate of $149 on a weekend. The room was totally adequate and I requested a view of Coit Tower and got it free of charge, even though they said they usually charge extra for that view. The room was small, very small compared to other hotels I've stayed at in SF, but the view was amazing. The Tv was old and outdated and not in any sort of armoire. It was sitting on a stand in the corner. The bathroom door was a slider that was on the outside of the room (not a pocket door) with a big gap, allowing virtually NO privacy. Something to be noted depending on who you're traveling with. Despite all that we had a great time. Chinatown and North Beach are within walking distance as is the Embarcadero. The lobby is nice with a great lounge and a decent restaurant. Across the street is a great park for kids with replica Chinatown buildings. It was a fine stay, but NOT fancy at all. Also, $50 parking!! Figure this in when deciding on a hotel. And I really don't think it merits 4*'s: inadequate bathroom door, no robes, no turn down, very small rooms, etc.","Feb 11, 2008","2","2",3,4,6,5,5,4,1,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_4677","Better, and $30 cheaper than the union square hilton As title .. was exactly $30 cheaper than the hilton on union sq but arguably better, and its not long ago had a full refit (or so I was told)Bay view room on the 19th floor with a good view of alcatraz- room was immaculate as you would expect. Nice furnishings, quiet, and comfortable. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel which was fast enough.The beds are amazingly comfortable!Location is fine- ignore the financial district tag as its really not a big issue. If you want to go to union sq sort of area its a couple of bucks ride away- no more than a few minutes cab or a few mins drive.Its nice and central for most things in SF, but quiet enough at nite that you will get a decent nites sleep.Staff great, doorman helpful, and the hotel is as you would expect from a hilton.Dont park in the hotel lot (its $45!)- use the one across the st, or go 1 block up onto jackson st (turn right) and there is a good underground secured lot there which won't break the bank.Great irish bar (kels- see my seattle review for mention of their sister bar!) a block away on jackson, as well as a great burger place (whose name annoyingly escapes me..). Plenty of nightlife and restaurants not far away just a few blocks north of the hotel.Myself being a Hilton Hhonors gold card holder has its advantages... access to the exec lounge with complimentary continental breakfast saves a fair amount of cash over a stay- especially if you have more than one guest.

"hotel_143","hotel_8789","Expectations Met for SFO Spent weekend at hotel in very comfortable room - although hotel face-lift did not include replacing drafty windows which means the street noise can be heard. Downtown San Francisco is noisy at the best of times so the hotel really needs to invest in improving this feature to really shine. Room service was good and fast, although like everything else in the City, somewhat overpriced. The most disappointing aspect is the dingy room used as a Business Lounge - this is typical of many Hilton's in the US where this feature is not really taken seriously as compared to overseas Hilton properties. The hotel service was quite good though with front desk and concierge most pleasant. Overall good experience, but hotel is 7 dressed up as a 9.","Jan 22, 2008","3","1",5,5,5,5,5,5,4,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_10567","Very Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel in the spring of 2007 for nine nights while on business. The pictures and description from Trip Advisor were very accurate and the rooms were very nice. Overall the rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. I was given a bayview room which was great except for the fact that it was the room farthest from the elevators which meant that my window wasn't as large as the window in most of the other rooms - the view was a little obscured. I didn't eat in the hotel restaurant or patronize the bar, but both looked very stylish. The parking charges were expensive, but from what I gather that is the way things go in downtown SFO. The hotel staff members were very helpful and the valets always had a smile. The hotel was a short walk to Union Square with all the shopping a person could ever need. With this hotel you are also very close to the BART system, on the edge of Chinatown, and a quick cable car ride to Fisherman's Wharf. I would definitely recommend this hotel for business travellers and tourists who want good value for their hotel dollars.

"hotel_143","hotel_8630","Cleaned Up it's Act! We had to spend one night in San Francisco before heading north and I wasn't going to spend an arm and a leg on a pricey hotel room. I found a good rate at the Hilton in Chinatown and booked it. I knew this hotel, it was the former Holiday Inn Chinatown. This hotel had a lot of wear and tear when it was the Holiday Inn and I wasn't expecting anything. We just needed a room at a good price. My expectations were low.I was surprised at every step of the way. Hilton has spent a ton of money to upgrade this hotel and it showed. The hotel's architecture is 60's concrete and little can be done with the bland exterior. However the lobby has been redone and is urban chic. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. It was late when we checked in and they gave us a tip of calling a great pizza place in North Beach and ordering a killer pizza, the pizza place delivers to the hotel. It was a tip that we took and did not regret - it was great!Our room was comfortable. We had a wonderful city view. The decor was modern and updated. The room was average sized, but had big comfortable beds and nice new furniture.I was only sad that we had to leave so early in the morning. I wasn't expecting much, but was nicely surprised at how nicely Hilton has redone this dump of a hotel. The staff also gets kudos here!","Jan 13, 2008","1","1",6,6,5,6,6,6,6,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_5078","Great Destination I put a bid on Priceline for a 3 star hotel for 90.00 per nite. I didn't know where we were going to stay, but was happy to find our bid accepted by the Hilton Financial District. After reading many reviews, I wasn't sure of what to expect, but I am usually a little skeptical of really negative reviews.We were NOT disappointed! This hotel is a GREAT deal for that price! Was it perfect? No. But it IS a VERY nice place to stay! I would LOVE to stay there again for that price! The downside: The room is comfortable, but not overly roomy. It is however, well appointed with nice furniture, and a very nice bathroom, even if it isn't overly roomy. The bed was VERY comfortable, and we had NO problem getting a good nite's sleep. We were on the 6th floor, and there was no noise to speak of, and we were there on a Friday and Saturday nite. There is not a lot of room to store luggage. Parking is expensive. 50.00 a night for valet parking. You can park right across the street for 37.00 a nite, or you can go up Kearny one short block to Jackson, turn right, and and there is a nice parking garage there for only 24.00 per nite. You can drop your luggage off at the hotel entrance and then take your car to the garage on Jackson. Don't let the valet take it, or you may be charged!Other than that, we had no problems staying at this nice hotel. It is right across the street from Chinatown. 2 of the highest rated Chinese restaurants in San Francisco are barely a block away. The R  G Lounge on Kearny, and the Hunan Home's Restaurant on Jackson. We ate at the Hunan Home's, and it was some of the BEST Chinese food we have ever had! The Honey Walnut Prawns are delicious!Another Highly rated Steakhouse is literally 50 feet from the entrance to the hotel. It's located on the side street (alley) to the right of the hotel entrance as you face it. It is called Alfred's Steakhouse, and has been in San Franciso since 1928. It is a classy place with mouthwatering steaks. The Porterhouse is 32 ounces! My wife and I split that with a couple side dishes, salad, and ended up each taking some steak home with us. This is NOT sizzler. But it IS worth the money! Reservations recommended.

There were times we couldn't see the Coit Tower for the fog, but it was allways magical. We had a meal and a breakfast in the restaurant and both were excellent. We had the same waiter both times, and he was very friendly but didnt intrude. I think some of the negative reviews that have been posted have been from priceline-type guests who may not get rooms very high up or bayside. The single-pane windows do let in a bit of street noise, but complete silence wouldn't be right either. SF is a city!Another nice feature is a pedestrian bridge directly from the hotel to a major park in Chinatown. The hotel is at the very western edge of the financial district and is the nearest big hotel to Chinatown, with its narrow, crowded sidewalks and perhaps the best people-watching in the city.One other thing, we have Hiltion Honors membership, and that may account for our good room location.","Jan 6, 2008","1","1",6,5,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_2865","Great hotel and value! I recently stayed at this hotel in the financial district. Usually, when I go to San Francisco, I stay in Union Square, but I was looking for some last minute weekend deals and decided to try out this area. This is the second time I stayed in this area of the city.The hotel is very nice - the rooms are nice and modern, and a bit cozy. But this is San Francisco - which, much like Chicago and New York, the rooms can be small. But the amenities were top notch, and the free internet access was a bonus. The only things I noticed were that the elevators are slow on the way down - especially during the core check out hours. And the bar staff couldn't be bothered with a few questions. Other than that, it was a decent location. A couple of blocks from Embarcadero Center, it's about a 10-15 minute walk to Union Square, right next to the Transamerica building. I stayed on a weekend, so the streets weren't as busy as it probably is during the week. One plus was that since it was a Saturday night stay, I was able to park on the street. I heard that hotel parking is $48, but I paid $3/hour on the street and then after 6pm, the meters are free, as well as all day Sunday. I would stay here if you don't mind walking and looking for a little more value and comfort. I wouldn't stay here if walking isn't something you're looking to do much of. It gets pretty scarce later at night on the streets between Union Square and the hotel, but there always seems to be someoone walking by. I had no issues walking home at 2 in the morning. I recently discovered this area as a cheaper alternative to Union Square the week before and stayed at another close by property as well.","Dec 24, 2007","2","2",6,6,5,6,6,4,6,"4","$236"

North beach, Chinatown and the financial district are literally a few blocks away. The BART is a bit of a walk, but you're in San Francisco...it's what you do. We flew there, so we didn't have to deal with the parking. But I would recommend that you not use the valet if you are interested in saving money. There are a couple of lots down the street for a fraction of the cost, and they are not hard to find. I have read reviews about the noise and the thin walls...and the neighbor next door was a bit obnoxious. But if he wasn't yelling at someone at the top of his lungs, we probably would have never heard him.The decor of the hotel was awesome. Very modern, bright and clean. Did not eat at the hotel, so can't comment on room service or the restaurants in the hotel. The room had a city view (did I mention I only paid $120 ;-)), and it was clean, comfortable and roomy.

Hotwire surprised me by zoning it into Embarcadero rather than Union Square East!Anyhow, I checked in on Sat, Dec 1 at 4pm, and was told right away by Monica, a dark-skinned lady at front desk, that she only has rooms with 2 double-beds available, and upgrading to a bay-view room with King-szie bed would cost $50 more. With my wife standing right beside me, I had to take it even though I knew it was a rip-off (I paid only $85 to Hotwire). The room was kind of small, but has a great view facing Coit Tower and the bay. The bed is comfortable as others suggested. But everything else is below my standard of a 4-star hotel. The bath room is really small with a single sink. The tub is small. The recent face-lift was done with poor quality and cheap material. And 25-inch TV?Even worse, it is noisy even at 18th floor. There was some constant noise there even when I turned off my heater/AC. The building has poor sound insulation, so I was waken up real early in the morning first by shower in the next room and then vacume on the floor above.All in all, this is a 2.5 star in my opinion! This is my first time staying in a Hilton in the US, and I will never do it again. And I guess no more Hotwire either.","Dec 3, 2007","1","0",2,3,4,3,2,2,4,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_5239","Pros did not outweigh cons My husband and I planned a one-night getaway to San Francisco for our first time ever overnight away from our two young kids. We decided to be spontaneous and book a hotel through Hotwire - got a great deal on this Hilton ($85) and decided that it whatever happened, we would enjoy ourselves because we could actually get a good night's sleep! Well...we didn't. At around 12:30 am, we were awakened from VERY LOUD people on BOTH sides of our room (both the rooms on either side of our room). We called hotel services and they claimed that they would send up security to deal with it. Not sure if they ever did, because the noise continued intermittently until 2 am!!! We were extremely sad about this turn of events.On the pro side, the bed was very comfortable and the view was great.Beware: the $46 valet parking fee applies even if you want to park and drop off your bags. We parked out in front, told the vaelt that we would be back as soon as we checked in, and they still tried to charge us $46 for 20 minutes!!!Overall, we would not stay here again.","Dec 2, 2007","1","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_9337","Superb views (and modern furnishings!) This was a wonderful experience. A pal helped me book and got me a room for $90. Even if it had been $200, I'd still give this place great marks. First, the place was truly modernized and had really fresh, design-y furniture, bedding, accessories. Second, my view - I think I was in the 20-something floors - was magnificent. I had a beautiful wide view of the north side of the city, including North Beach, Golden Gate Bridge, etc. Just wonderful to wake up to. My main complaint is the high cost of parking - $42 for valet or self-parking. That's downtown SF for you. I found my own lot - there's one just across the street - and paid a bit less.","Nov 28, 2007","1","1",6,6,6,6,5,5,5,"4","$236"

Check-in was very slow, and the front desk staff seemed a bit apathetic. The valet seemed a bit unprofessional and seemed a bit rude when we decided we didn't want to pay the ridiculous price of $46 dollars for valet (we parked across the street)The room and bathroom were really nice and modern, which I like about the Hilton chain. Our room had a nice view as well. The hotel is in a great location for doing the touristy things and is very close to North Beach, which is great to get some delicious italian. We pretty much stayed in our room that night because we got in late (we flew in from barcelona) and we enjoyed the comfy bed and a/c which we hadn't had in 6 weeks (we had gone backpacking in Asia/Europe/Africa_.There are far better hotels in San Francisco with better customer service and more reasonable parking fees.

Agree w/previous poster that is was average to above average for the price, but wouldn't have been thrilled had I paid rack rate (which was an astounding $429/night). The room was nice, we liked the built-in desk area that filled the whole bottom half of the window - served as a make-up area, bar, storage place, etc. We found the beds to be VERY comfortable.No waits for the elevators, very friendly other guests - chatting us up about the ASN conference, a run along the wharf, etc. Lobby staff was fine, but we had no one offer to help us with bags on the way in (12:30 a.m., but staff was standing around) and the bellman we checked our bags with on the last day (we had a red-eye flight home) basically begged for a tip I won't be here when you return, but I will take care of your bags. The shower was very short but decent water pressure. The sliding door to the bathrooom was slightly odd and if someone got up to use the facilities during the night, the light was VERY bright through the opaque glass for the rest of us!For the price and location (we walked everywhere except for a ride back on the cable car one time) we would definitely stay there again.","Nov 8, 2007","0","0",5,4,6,4,5,4,1,"4","$236"

I am glad I booked w/ Priceline because having to pay over $200 per night would not have been worth it. The doormen/valet service is great and they are always willing to get you a cab. Parking w/the hotel is way too expensive! The rooms were comfortable, but we didn't get a king size bed as requested. Instead we got two doubles w/ a great view of Coit tower that we enjoyed so it wasn't a bad compromise! The beds are not as comfortable as you would expect, for being called Serenity Beds. Location is great, a few blocks from North Beach, Little Italy. Be sure to hit up Trattoria Pinocchio on Colombus for the best Italian food in the city!

"hotel_143","hotel_10092","No problems Stayed 2 nights for combined business/family getaway (with 2 preteens). I have read the reviews here and knew that while some love the property, there were also problems reported. I am happy to report that we had no significant problems. I did have to think long and hard about the rating here, though. It ranged between average to above average. I did have a generally favorable experience overall. If, however, I had paid the rack rate, I think I would have been less happy. For the location, the general price and other flavor seemed in line with what I would expect with similar properties in the area. Personally, I usually choose a different type of property (we like a fridge and microwave - neither of which are standard in these rooms), but this hotel suited our needs well-enough for this trip.The room was booked online via the hotel website, with a AAA discount. This process is extremely easy. By booking with the hotel (rather than a blind site such as Priceline), I did get the Bay view, concierge level floor with lounge access. This also helped make for a pleasant stay as we could get breakfast in the morning, and appetizers in the evening (approximate hours 6-10am-ish and 5-9pm-ish, I think). Selections were actually fairly good. Bar service in the concierge lounge was available for an additional fee. Frankly, though there were multiple complaints previously listed here re: the speed of the elevators, I thought they were great. In fact, on a few occasions, I wanted to look out of the window at the view from a different vantage point than my room (window by the elevator), and the elevator arrived too quickly. The slot where you have to swipe your room key for the elevator to take you to (certain?) floors is too small, and takes a fair amount of finesse to work smoothly. Perhaps this is part of the delay others have mentioned. Check in was very quick (arrived around 6-7pm). Staff was nice, but the first try resulted in no access to the concierge lounge. A quick return trip to the lobby was all it took to resolve it. Check out also no problem with final bill provided under the door in a timely manner. Room was clean. Bathroom very small, with bathtubs noticeably small/short. The sliding door on the bathroom didn't close very tightly, making privacy a potential issue if several are staying in the room. Flat screen TV was nice, but couldn't figure out how to hook up a DVD player (and we usually have no problem with this). Beds were full size, but comfortable. The bay view from the 24th floor was good (I wouldn't say astounding, but good). It was an easy walk down Kearney or Montgomery to California St. to catch the cable cars (be aware can be packed at certain times of the day). The rest of the family also used the bus system one day. Be aware many of the streets are one-way as you figure where the buses go. We also had a rental car which we were very happy parking across the street (literally ACROSS the street) in the Portsmouth Square garage. Their rate at $26/day is substantially better than the Hilton, but you don't get in/out privileges. For us, this was absolutely fine - may not be best for everyone if you plan to come and go often. The other garage has a website you can Google for info.While I am not eagerly planning my next trip here, we would be willing to stay here again if circumstances were similar.","Nov 6, 2007","1","1",4,5,5,5,4,4,1,"4","$236"

There is free wireless in all the rooms, which is an added bonus. The hotel is located on the doorstep of the Chinese quarter and this was great for getting Chinese food and it is a short walk to the shopping district. The hotel is not served very well by public transport.As it was our first visit to San Francisco, we approached the concierge who had to be the most helpful man I ever met. He provided some great anecdotes about his various stays around the world. He spent almost half an hour guiding us through the map of San Francisco. You have to ask him about the 'NO' area.

"hotel_143","hotel_8613","Some helpful hints (I hope...) Based on previous reviews, it just so happens my experience allows me to give you some tips. I will write this review accordingly.Location: You are about 5 blocks away from anything a tourist would want. But, once you walk those 5 blocks you are at the edge of the tourist areas, market st, etc. so you'll have to keep on walking after that. The area directly around the hotel is not pretty but it didn't feel unsafe. Know that the first few minutes walk after you get out of the hotel there is basically nothing. The Montgomery BART/MUNI station is about a 10 minute walk, Montgomery St. is behind the hotel and it's a much nicer atmosphere to walk through. Having been to SF many times, the only reason I stayed at this location was the confluence of 3 conventions that weekend making hotels unavailable and expensive, I got this place Priceline cheap.The lobby is nice and I also experienced the disorganized check in process others have written about. After getting to my room, I was not happy with it and the guest service line went unanswered for 10 minutes, so I went downstairs and cut a very long line as I had already waited on one to check in.The odd # rooms all face the bay while the even # ones face the Union Square area of SF. I was first given an -01 room which had beautiful bay windows with an expansive view of the water. It was a cozy handicapped room with a spacious bathroom and a wardrobe but no closet. It is right next to the soda/ice machine and the elevators. Not all -01 rooms are handicapped but I imagine they are all the same size. I can't vouch for noise because I was only in it for 15 minutes in the morning. The only thing wrong with it was the handicapped shower head was too low for my 6'1 height and was not going any higher. I was not in the mood for kabuki showers. Note that the shower head in my next room was not much higher, if you are over 5 feet you'll be bending over/leaning back to wash your hair in this property!I switched to a -25 room which after entering tucked into a corner of the building. The view was still of the bay but the windows much smaller. It had a closet and a large chest. The desk area in the corner was great, with shelves underneath and a TV that since it was not in an armoire was easily adjustable to be seen from anywhere in the room. The room, like the -01 room was slightly smaller than the other rooms I passed by but I think the fact that -25 is sequestered away from the room next to it makes it ideal if you like quiet. The only negative is that it's right next to the housekeeping closets so at 5pm and 9 am you hear the constant open/close of the doors as they prepare to work.My bathroom was small but completely adequate. Bed was comfortable, rooms were very clean. I really enjoyed my cozy room but if you stay here be prepared!","Oct 29, 2007","2","0",4,4,3,4,3,1,1,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_1459","Valet left the car sitting on the street - burglarized, declined comp I checked into the Hilton Financial District around 10:00 PM after a long drive and handed the car over to the valet to be parked. I then checked into my room, which had nice views and was well appointed. Waking up the next morning, I was slightly shocked to find the valet parking charge to be $46, which easily qualifies as the highest valetcharge I ever paid, but so what. Then, I called valet to have them prepare my car, and they couldnt seem to find my valet number. They told me not to worry, they will manage. So I made my way down, check out and step in front of the hotel to pick up my car, only to find mycar still sitting on the exact spot where I turned it over to the valet the night before, right on the sidewalk, with the passenger window smashed and some personal items stolen. So, I paid $46 for valet, who did not park my car in the parking structure where it would have been reasonably safe, but left it our sitting on the sidewalk well visible to any passerby, and was not even informed of the crime until I walked right up to my car. Now this is where the bad part begins: The Hilton disclaimed any responsibility because Valet is operated by ACE parking, a seperate company. ACE parking does explicitly and on the valet ticket disclaim any responsibility for damage to the car - one of these clauses you always encounter andask yourself: So what if this guy totals my car ? - Apparently, this disclaimer even covers the situation in which valet severly screws up and simply leaves the car sitting on the sidewalk for $46.","Oct 20, 2007","4","2",2,4,4,4,3,2,3,"4","$236"

The walls are paper thin and I was woken at various stages of my 4-night stay by the rooms on both sides. On two occassions I needed to call the front desk and while they did send somebody up their reaction was such that it seemed that it occurred regularly. Certainly if I were a business traveller (which a lot of the guests appeared to be) I would not want to stay here due to the noise. In addition there is a lot of street noise. While the area outside is safe there appeared to be trouble at one bar directly underneath my room where the police had to be called.

While I didn't much care for the furnishings/color schemes in the rooms or corridors, everything was comfortable, immaculately maintained, and professionally managed. There seem to be lots of meetings and conferences here. While I can see how this might strain property resources as other reviews have mentioned, during my stay, everything was well run. A few minor quibbles: as others have mentioned, there is a high level of neighborhood/external noise .. bring earplugs. The elevators can be slow and quite crowded during peak hours. While the property is technically central, it's far enough away from Union Square/cable cars/Market St that some travelers (elderly, or with small children) might find the walk more than they bargained for. Others will have no problem, and SFO is nothing if not a walking city.

There are really only two positive things I can say about this hotel:* The concierge was polite and helpful;* The rate through Priceline ($100 / 拢50 p.night) was reasonableAm sorry to say that everything else from start to finish of our 3 day stay (and the aftermath) was poor. Specifically:a) Despite three phone calls prior to arrival the Hotel refused to book us a king room (and/or bay view room), saying that we had to ask on arrivalb) On check-in the clerk said there were no king rooms, no bay view rooms and no rooms above the 5th floor. Thanks!c) On arriving at our 'full-size' room we discovered: One of the 'phones did not work, the bath plug did not work, and it was noisy. The 'wireless internet' did not work in the room as the signal was so weak;d) The 'city-view' room had no double glazing (in the 21st century? really?) and so was highly susceiptible to street noise;e) As many have said, the elevators were so slow that queues of literally 10 - 15 people (most of whom appeared to be college students who were the worst for wear) regularly gathered in reception waiting just to get to their rooms;f) On our last night (a Sunday) we needed to get an early night (ie. 10:00pm) prior to a 6:00AM flight the next day. On returning to our room we found that the noise from the karaoke in the conference room TWO FLOORS below was so loud that there was no hope of getting to sleep. After 40 minutes complaining (having tried to ring reception for 15 minutes without success, the phone having been apparently off the hook) and then having to take the emergency stairs because the lifts were so slow, we were told that the noise would stop at 11:30 as security had been notified; My partner stressed to reception that we did not want to return to our room to find that the noise had not abated because it would take so long to contact reception again.Having got back to our room, we discovered the noise was as bad as ever.After a further 20 mins on the phone, we were told the hotel could do nothing about it as the party had permission to continue until midnight. We were told there were no rooms elsewhere in the hotel to which to move.On continuing to compain we were eventually put through to a Mr. Mark Everton (the general manager) who magically discovered a new room on the 11th floor and who offered us the grand sum of $50 in cash incompensation to pay for our taxi to the airport the next morning. By this time it was 12:30 am....g) Unbelievably, on checking out at 6:00am we discovered the Hilton had had the gall to charge the $50 to our room. Having wasted a further 15 mins explaining the situation to the desk clerk he issued us with a credit note but no apology.h) On returning to the UK we discovered the Hilton had charged us the $50 and not honoured the credit note.A FAX to Mr. Everton yielded no results and a follow-up phone call (at our expense!!!!) failed to prompt an apology.To date we are yet to receive the credit.......","Sep 11, 2007","4","3",3,3,3,4,3,2,3,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_2255","Service counts The hotel looks great on the surface. It's clean (unlike some other reviewers mention), modern, and renovated. But once you settle in you'll fine many little annoyances. To mention few: the bathroom outlet had no power, the toilet flush did not work properly, the coffee maker was broken etc. None are a big deal but for a 4 star, recently renovated hotel, you would expect more. The most important problem with the building itself is that there is no sound proofing. The windows' glass is so thin, it was as if we had left the windows open. We heard every little street sound. And it is a very noisy area. So if you are sensetive to city noise during sleep, don't even consider it there. There was some noise from adjacent rooms, but the street noise overshadowed that anyway. The beds were nice. The shower was great. The rooms was amall. But the main problem we had was the service. We checked in late but were told that the houskeeping was running behind and our room was not ready. In addition, we had requested a king bed and they said there are only rooms with double beds available if any. When asked for upgrades to something which is ready, they said nothing available. After we finally got a room, my wife was diappointed with the view, so she called and asked if we could at least get a bay view out of courtesy since they did not have king bed we had requested. They said since we made our reservation online, we are the lowest priority and will not be able to get anything better than what our current room was. That I found too blunt for customer servie in a 4 start hotel. Just a final note, they had added a $20 dollar room serive on the checkout bill, when I inquire about this (couple times on the phones which they said will look into and call back but never did and finally in person), they said they could not find any receipts for it and waived it.

I called the front desk to have them fix it the next day, they never fixed it! When I called the second day to request another room, I was told the same thing. They did not even offer to upgrade me.

"hotel_143","hotel_3583","An Amazing View, Great Location and Fantastic People! We stayed for two nights at the Hilton on the end of our 10 day visit to California. First of all, the location is pefect. You are on the edge of Chinatown and North Beach. Fisherman's Wharf is a 15-20 minute walk and you can get to downtown easily. We loved the room we had due to the modern furnishings and the amazing view of the skyline of the city. Simply beautiful..the view is worth it..especially from an upper floor.Also, I was impressed with the staff. The guys at the front bellstand/consierge were always willing to help us find out how to get where we wanted to go. Very friendly and extremely helpful...I can't praise them enough.We never ate anything at the hotel (except a few sweet rolls one morning) and it lacks a pool or hot tub or even an exercise room.

"hotel_143","hotel_7366","Hilton, Financial Disctrict - Great Location! We stayed 7 nights (8/29-9/5/07) and got the room through Priceline for $85.00 per night. Priceline considers this hotel 鈥淔inancial District鈥? though one may argue it is in Chinatown. Really I think the Hilton refers to it as being in the Financial District, so Priceline does as well. Either way, it is in a great location. We did not have a car, so I cannot comment on parking/driving, although it is expensive. I feel the location makes up for needing a car 鈥?my husband and I walked everywhere. The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the airport, $26.00 per person (plus tip). We did this going from the hotel, and a cab cost $60.00 to the hotel from the airport. Pros:Great location! On the cusp of Chinatown, in walking distance to North Beach  Union Square. Fantastic views! We were given a room with a view of the bay and Coit Tower. I know with Priceline you cannot guarantee this 鈥?but we were lucky. If you book your room the old fashioned way, be sure to ask for this side of the hotel. Well worth it! Room d茅cor was trendy and modern. In general very clean. ConsLow water pressure in shower and toilet. Small spots of mold in bathroom. Ceiling had peeling pant near window. SLOW elevators. You have to use your room key in the elevator to get to your floor. We stayed for 7 nights and the hotel held $1050 on our credit card for incidentals. We called the front desk and had this amount lowered to $400.00, but it was a struggle. Loud, but the city is loud in general. You can hear people in the hall, but then you hear car alarms and cars/trucks/people outside too. I think it will be loud no matter where you stay in the city. Overall, none of the 鈥渃ons鈥?are enough to keep us from coming back. When bidding for a room through Priceline (and paying under $100.00 per night), we realize we are not going to get the most premium room in the hotel. This hotel met my expectations and I would recommend it to others.","Sep 6, 2007","2","1",4,5,6,4,4,4,1,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_7264","Great Stay at the Hilton Fin Dist We visited San Francisco for the first time as a family during the first week of August. We booked this Hilton through Hotwire, but I was already interested in staying there because the 'candid' photos of the hotel room views on Trip Advisor looked great, and the location looked convenient to the areas we wanted to visit. So I was pleased when the 'blind' selection through Hotwire was this Hilton.After reading a bit more and thinking about it, I was a little worried about the the size of the room for our family, which includes two young teens. I called the reservations desk at the hotel to inquire about upgrading to a larger room, and was able to do so for an additional fee. I spoke several times to the front desk and reservations prior to my stay and received excellent service.The hotel room did not disappoint. As many have stated here, the views (at least on the bay side) are SPECTACULAR. The city views I think are good too - but not as good. The decor in our room was also very nice (4 star in my opinion), very nice bathroom, and clean. For us the upgrade was well worth it. We even had dinner in our room on evening (take-out from Tommaso's down the street) in order to enjoy the view.Our room was a larger room on the 25th floor, with a King bed and pull out queen sofa bed. We also had a kitchenette with a sink and fridge that we used a lot. The bathroom was large, with a nice walk in shower - no tub.We did not eat at the hotel other than the 'club floor' continental breakfast and hors d'oeuvres served on the 26th floor (the bfast was a little better than your typical Hampton Inn continental breakfast). We used the breakfast every morning because it was free and convenient. We thought about eating at '750', but there are too many other good options in the area.The location is very good given it's close walking location to Chinatown, Union Square, North Beach, Coit Tower and Embarcadero/Ferry Building. The entrance of the hotel faces Chinatown, the other side of the hotel faces the Financial District, 2 blocks down is North Beach. The most convenient cable car line is California St, a few blocks away.There were always a lot of people on the streets around the hotel, so I felt safe walking around there at all times. There are a few blocks towards North Beach that have a couple of 'x-rated' clubs. Those blocks are easily avoided (if so desired).My only complaints with the hotel were that the front desk and concierge could be very difficult to reach by phone from the hotel. I think they could actually use a second full time concierge. The other complaint was the management of the driveway in front. It is totally out of control and was blocked for extended periods. If you are driving at all (we rented cars for trips out of the city), I would recommend stopping on the street rather than pulling in the drive and getting stuck. The elevators can be very busy, and be prepared for a quick draw of your room card necessary to access all floors.**I highly recommend anyone planning a trip to SF visit the Forum page which is very active and helpful.A must for Saturdays is a stroll down to The Embarcadero and Ferry Building then down to the Wharf. It is a great time for a family. Many other suggestions are on the Forum.","Aug 12, 2007","3","2",6,6,6,6,6,6,4,"4","$236"

To the right is the bay and the Ferries. In the distance rise the mountains. Simply fantastic!(These were bay view rooms. Obviously not all rooms had this view.)The location was also wonderful. Chinatown is in front of the hotel. North Beach starts just to the right and Market Street and the Financial District are just to the left. Behind you is the Embarcaderro.The room and hotel decor is very stylish and modern, giving this rather large hotel the feel of a smaller upscale boutique hotel. The rooms are not large, but are thoughtfully laid out so that they feel quite comfortable and have very nice work space and bathrooms. Loved the flat screen TV's and the sliding door to the bathroom.The staff was fine, but I didn't have any food or room service.I really enjoyed my stay there--too bad it was for one night only.","Aug 9, 2007","2","1",6,6,6,6,6,5,6,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_3838","Best Hotel Room Ever We stayed at this hotel from July 14th for a week. The hotel has completely been modernised and is very very shiny and new. The style is very modern and very hip. We had booked directly with the hotel and had booked a bay view room. Upon checking in however there were no bay view rooms avaiiable and the girl on reception asked us to wait while she checked with her manager, on returning she came back to say she had managed to get us a room on the top floor of the hotel which she said would have views of the bay.We were aprehensive until we got to the room. It was amazing!!! It was huge very modern and get this had French doors leading to a balcony and patio with the most amaxing view of the coit tower and the entire San Francisco Bay. It completely took our breath away. The room itself was spectacular in its decoration fit and finish, 32 inch wall mounted t.v, marble bathroom and an incredibly comfortable bed with lovely clean bed linen. We even had complimentary bath robes...Our stay was really incredible and the service from the staff was fantastic, very attentive and just what you would expect from a Hilton. We would stay at this hotel in a minute and could not reccommend it highly enough to anyone.

"hotel_143","hotel_4719","Good stay This hotel should come out of the closet and call itself the Hilton Chinatown. It even contains the Chinese Cultural Centre and it seems to be a very popular hotel for American Chinese and visiting Chinese,which gives it a bit of an exotic feel (for us irish countryfolk). It was great for us as one of the main purposes of our stay was to explore Chinatown. The hotel is also within walking distance of NorthBeach, the Embarcadera and Union Square so the location is the very best feature of this hotel. We stayed two nights and our comments generally are good. The room onthe 17th floor was great. Spotlessly clean and very well equipped. I would repeat the warning given by other reviewers - don't drink the Evian, it gets put on the bill. But at least the coffee is free. Alsowhy do they charge a dollar to make a toll-free call? We had a problem as our luggage was lost so had to keep phoning the help line.However, the staff very obligingly let us use the front desk phone for free when it was quiet.We had a lovely view from our room and did not experience any internal noise from the hotel. However, the noise from the street in the middle of the night was very bad. This, of course, is beyond the control of the hotel, but I mention it to warn others. I did not expect that the noise would carry up to the 17th floor, but it seemedlike there was a street party going on for at least an hour.There was a very good atmosphere in the hotel and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only glaring exception to this was themale concierge, who was unbelievably rude to us for no reason at all other than he thought we were British. (We are from Ireland). He actually said to us, when we gently asked him why he had turned his back on us, well you are British so I am being British back to you.Whatever that means. Maybe it was his idea of a joke and it did make us laugh because his attitude was so eccentric and completely uncalled for. We either had to laugh it off or take deep offence. My husband works in the tourist industry here in Ireland and would neverdream of treating his american guests in that way. The rest of the front desk staff were extremely kind and very good at their jobs. I can honestly say this as I had the opportunity to observe them for considerable time while I was using their phone to hold on 20 minutes for that freephone helpline.Overall a good stay considering it was in the centre of a busy city at the weekend and we would definitely use the hotel again but maybe polish up our american accents!","Aug 2, 2007","4","2",4,5,6,5,5,5,1,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_8687","Marginal at best - decor improved, but little else This hotel is conveniently located to the financial district, Chinatown and North Beach. Cabs were regularly at the hotel and public transportation was close. This property was formerly the Holiday Inn Financial District and is an older hotel. The decor has improved drastically, but the overall experience still was marginal at best.I waited thirty minutes to check-in due to a line of 14 people in front of me. There was not adequate staff at the front desk and the two that were there were not helpful at all. I thought I must have just hit a busy time or shift change, but the problems continued throughout the night. I had the same experience at check out - I took 18 minutes to just get a receipt (I did not receive one under my door as usual).The room decor was very nice and new, but the bathroom had odd screws where the hairdryer was missing. The room was very small, but functional.When I called for a wake-up call it took three tries since no one was answering the phone. I did not receive the call the next morning as requested.The conceirge level services were standard. I went to the evening hour (wine and beer incurred a charge, but soda and bottled water were free) - the snacks were adequate (cheese cubes, chips  salsa, some undistinguished fried blobs (we are still wondering what they were - the staff said appetizers when I asked). The breakfast the next morning was also ok, but not outstanding - pastries, cereal, yogurt  fruit.Overall the stay was ok, but the staff were consistently sparse and not very helpful. I stayed at the Hilton by Union Square the previous night and had an outstanding stay - I would pick this Hilton instead if I were returning to the area.

The room appeared recently updated with a modern flair. When looking closer at the room, the toilet wouldn't flush, the sink was plugged, a magnifying mirror had been ripped out of the bathroom wall, and the walls were paper thin. We could have managed a little bit of noise from our neighbors except we could hear them yelling and playing a drinking game. We called the front desk to be moved, and were moved to a room on another floor where more partying was taking place. We rode the elevator with an assistant manager who said he had just caught 5 college-age boys trying to sneak into a room with their sleeping bags. It was definitely a younger crowd at the hotel, and we could never figure out if there was a central party or if everyone was just doing their own thing.

"hotel_143","hotel_3818","Great for the Price My husband and I along with our two children stayed at the Hilton for our week-end in San Francisco. The service was excellent, especially the concierge who was extremely friendly and had great tips and advice. The rooms were large by San Francisco standards with two double beds and a nice view of the city. On Hotwire we got the room for $109 per night, which is an excellent price for the quality and location. We were an easy walk to union square, and a short walk to the #30 line which goes to Fisherman's Wharf, and the Marina district. And right across the street from China town. Here is my only complaint: instead of a regular door on the bathroom, there was a pocket door that was put on a track on the outside of the doorway in a very ill-fitting, makeshift way that left large gaps on either side of the door. The door itself was predominantly frosted glass. This made for some uncomfortable lack of privacy for a family of four.

The beds were very comfortable though, the bathrooms lovely and the staff helpful. It's in a very good location, right next to Chinatown and there's a fantastic Chinese restaurant just down Kearny street: RG Lounge.

I was a little apprehensive since we had booked through Priceline for the first time; but contrary to other reviews the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Thanks to tips from other reviewers, we paid extra($40 per room per night) for upgrades to bayview rooms and the expense was definitely worth it! Had absolutely fantastic views of the SF bay and city! The facility's location is very convenient, close to Chinatown, North Beach, Embarcadero - we were able to walk to most places (including Union Square and Ferry Building) and cabs to other areas within the city were readily available - usually cost 10-15$ at the most. Muni, cable and Bart stops are not very close however and Union Square hotels may be a better choice if you want to use these frequently. The rooms are a good size, beds and furniture is modern and very comfortable. Both the rooms and other parts of the hotel are well maintained and clean. There is a coffee shop in the lobby which is pretty good and reasonably priced. The onsite restaurant - Seven Fifty had good service though the food could have been better. Did not get a chance to try the spa (Tru). There is a public garage across the street that charges $26/night (price does not include multiple entry/exits); valet parking at the hotel is $48 (price includes multiple entry/exits) Would definitely stay here again, highly recommend this facility especially if you get a deal throgh priceline/hotwire.","Jun 24, 2007","3","2",6,5,6,5,6,6,3,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_2743","Acceptable for the Price Booked this hotel throught Priceline, seems to be a common thread here. Hotel itself was perfectly acceptable for what we wanted, a decent hotel room while we visited San Francisco on vacation for four days. We had a bit of an issue at checkin, as we required a room with a safe in it. Most hotels at this stage have safes in all of their rooms, but it appears that the corner rooms (which are a little smaller than the standard rooms) don' t have safes. In any event, after two more room changes - it was third time lucky. The room we got was good, clean and a good size for San Francisco. On another note, valet parking is $48 per day, which in my book is a bit much, however there is a self park underground parking lot directly across the street from the hotel which is $26 per day, so if you're bringing a car into the city this is the way to go.

There was no refrigerator in the room; could've used one. There is no gift shop either; all they have is a Zoom machine very similar to a soda vending machine.

My room was at least half the size of the normal 4* room I've grown accustomed to under their system. The moaning and groaning of the ventilation systems and elevator shafts permeated my room. I had better towels to dry myself off in high school then what was provided by the Hilton. The lobby area is nothing to be inspired by. The location isn鈥檛 near any of the transit systems except the busses. My view was overlooking China Town which from the ground is great but from above is not very attractive. I had a vodka/cranberry cocktail in the lounge and it cost me $9.  And they still need to do some serious upgrading to an older facility. My stays at the Hyatt are always beyond compare. It鈥檚 sad to say but once a Holiday Inn always a Holiday Inn.","Jun 11, 2007","10","4",3,2,3,4,4,4,4,"4","$236"

We were able to get everywhere we wanted to go -- Wharf/Pier 39, Embarcadero, Union Square, the BART station, etc. -- within an easy walk. We booked on Hotwire and even though parking was an astronomical $42 a night, it still made it about the same price as the hotels with free parking. The bed alone was worth it -- soooo comfortable. As the previous poster said, it's actually more Chinatown than Financial District; but that was OK with us.

The staff was very friendly and helpful.The only negative was that the hotel is not child friendly. We had to fit two pack and plays in our room and asked the front desk clerk if we could have one of the bigger standard rooms. She stated that all rooms were the same size (which I know isn't true, corner rooms, etc are bigger). The room was barely big enough to put both pack n plays.

The room was wonderful, large for a city hotel and with a wonderful view of the city and Alcatraz. Room service food was excellent although a little expensive. We never used the resturants in the hotel but they were always busy. I had a massage at the spa and it was wonderful, one of the best massages I've ever had.

We were right in line with Coit Tower and could easily see Alcatraz out in the bay and Marin to the north. Chinatown is pretty much directly across Kearny St..

"hotel_143","hotel_2786","Excellent value- great location. First time in Sanfranciso caught the Bart train from the Airport into Powell St Station. Hilton a short walk away but perfectly safe despite having 2 rollersuitcaes.Hilton is ideally situated close to Union Square where all the main prestiguous shops can be found. Similarly the cable car is close at hand to take you to Fishermans Wharf or China Town. One tip buy an all day ticket far cheaper than individual journeys.The Hilton was perfectly adequate for our needs we were stopping over for two nights prior to flying on to Auckland. We spent such little time in the hotel the fact we had a city facing room was of no consequence. A must is a visit to the restaurant on the 27th Floor not necessarily to eat but to witness the panoramic views it offers.A lot of beggars do seem to pass the front of the Hilton and will approach you - we used the simple expedient of speaking Welsh to them and they soon moved on.If visitng Sanfrancisco again we would certainly stay at the Hilton it's rates were sensible ,room more than adequate and it's geographic position ideal.","Feb 16, 2007","4","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_2516","Location, location, location The best thing about this hotel is that it sits at the junction of the financial district, North Beach, and Chinatown. It's very convenient to attend meetings during the day and then walk to good restaurants, cafes and nightspots. The Transamerica Tower is one block away. The air is perfumed with ginger, garlic, and exotic herbs all day long. In the morning the neighboring park is filled with seniors doing Tai Chi. And the Chinese economic wonder has flowed into this neighborhood: the energy is exciting and palpable. It is so much more interesting than, say, one of the large hotels that's too close to the tendrloin.Be sure to ask for a Bay view: you will have wide windows looking at Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill as well as the Cathedrals down Columbus, and neon on Broadway. If you pay more, the higher floors include Alcatraz and Sausalito in the picture. Avoid the City View at all costs - unless you enjoy staring into office rooms.I recently stayed here for the first time since it was converted from the Chinatown Holiday Inn. The prices went up about 30%, but the rooms didn't get any bigger. They completely remodeled, so the furniture is new and the beds are excellent. The towels were luxurious.Unfortunately, Hilton replaced the large closets with small wardrobes. Then they put a chest of drawers inside the wardrobe. Then they topped the drawers with a room safe. So, unless you are a child, you will have room for one jacket to hang. Your remaining clothing will have about 24 inches to fit in - the bottom of them piling on top of the chest-high safe. Their architect really failed here. I don't know what they were thinking.The new furniture looks nice, but it crowded my room - making it feel a little cramped. The large work surface is great for business, but it blocks a portion of the view. I really preferred the Holiday Inn's idea of easy chairs and a coffee table aimed directly down the view plane.The health club is well equipped. But you have to change in your room, as there are no lockers. You may want to pack a robe, as none are provided. I think the pool is gone. There had been one on the rooftop which had a most surreal setting: halfway up the side and in the giant shadow of the Transamerica Tower. I miss that, if only for the photo opportunity!The staff were friendly and very accommodating. The high speed Internet access was excellent.

This hotel was a Holiday Inn and has now been remodeled completely. I was told the Hilton is one year old at this location. Everyone made me feel welcome, from the lady who checked me in to the bellman who remembered my name. I was upgraded to a beautiful room on the 21st floor with a great view of the bay and Coit Towers. The bed was very comfortable, I especially like the pillows. ( I normally take my pillow with me because I do not like hotel pillows). The lady in the executive lounge Lisa, (I think this is her name) was so helpful, she aswered any questions I had about the hotel. The conceriege(sp) in the lobby was also very friendly, she made me feel very welcome to the hotel and that she was there to help me. She made suggestion about tours, etc. I did not need a tour as I have been to SF many times, but have not stayed in this area before. The staff seem proud of the hotel. The only small negative was when I went to take a bath, there were no face or bath towels. I called and that problem was taken care of shortly.The location is near China town(less than a block). If you want to go to the Fisherman's Wharf area, there is a # 15 bus that will take you there for $1.50 correct change.If you like to walk you can get to the North Beach area, and even downtown.

Right next to Chinatown for dim sum and the best chinese ever (House of Nan King) and North Beach for coffee, Italian food and Beach Blanket Babylon. If you like to walk, you can even walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Union Square is an easy walking distance as well. We even walked to Yank Sing for dim sum.

The #15 bus stops 1/2 block from the hotel and the MUNI system in San Fran is so easy to use. Got this thru priceline for $85 a night. Although I requested a high floor, i only got to the 12th floor. Be prepared for SMALL rooms and TINY beds. This was my biggest disappointment. I also had NO flat panel TV in my room. But I have heard that if you book thru priceline, you don't get such a good room as if you had gone thru the hotel directly. But I saved over $115 so that was worth it for me. Definitely visit Mama's Restaurant for Breakfast, Pinocchio for Italian in North beach, Mara's for the best cannoli's and Ghirardelli square for awesome chocolate. Staff was very friendly and eager to please. Esp the concierge Eric and the bell staff. Always available to give directions on where you wanted to go. Don't forget the shopping on Market Street.

I could walk to the waterfront, the Embarcadero Center, major shopping centers, etc., so I was quite happy with the location. Polite staff, a decent-sized room, and newly refurbished feel contributed to my above average rating of this hotel, even though as other reviewers wrote, it's a huge hotel and you tend to feel anonymous in it. I knew what to do in SF (shopping!) so the general no-frills feel was fine with me. Overall, I was quite nicely surprised by this hotel.

The check-out process was challenging, obtaining a print out of my bill was met with raised eyebrows (most hotels slip a copy under your door for speedy check-out), and I was told rather off-hand that I could have used the Zip-in Check-in machine to check-out. The Zip-in machine only says it's for check-in, but the front desk says you can use it for both. You may want to try this option to avoid the front desk.

The bed was unmade and it looked like someone had just left -- radio on, trash in the floor, etc. We were promptly sent to another room where, as we took a quick power nap, someone else walked in (they had checked in and been assigned our room and their key let them in as we slept -- yikes!)When my husband called to complain, the front desk person started acting like they could not hear him as he tried to explain the trouble. Then they hung up on him. Nice, eh?Finally, we were assured that all was well. After a FABULOUS dinner in the hotel restaurant (our waiter was the best ever. He steered us to the best entrees and made sure we had dessert on the house), we collapsed in our room only to be awakened by a thunderous noise from the pipes in the bathroom at Midnight. The noise continued and after we (and others nearby) complained, we were switched to yet another room where we could still hear the noise but at least it didn't vibrate the floor of our room anymore (the staff thought there was a problem with a regulator in the pipes). By this time, it was close to 1 am and we had a morning departure ahead.Then when we tried to check out and head to the airport in the morning, the elevators were not working. We had 3 heavy bags (couldn't carry wine on the plane due to new FAA rules so we'd packed some bottles) and were on the 27th floor. After a while, the elevators finally came back and we scrambled to make our flight.The hotel is lovely. Two of the three rooms we were assigned had a gorgeous Bay view. Restaurant staff were great. But there are certainly some management and maintenance issues. At the end, I wished we could get the Hilton points we'd spent back.","Aug 19, 2006","7","5",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$236"

Nice selection at coffee bar and hotel bar in the lobby. Sleek minimal design...yet family friendly. We got a great rate for 4 rooms for 2 nights through Priceline. Every staffperson we've encountered from the valet guys to housekeeping to front desk (except for one) were courteous and professional...even nice. The older frontdesk guy (40s maybe 50s, thin with a moustache) that checked us in smirked after he found our reservations when I asked if two of the rooms could be on the same floor since my kids are staying with us. (This is around 2:30 p.m.) He started scribbling something and looked at me and smirked. Asked me to initial the paper which turned out to be my room reservation with the price crossed out (because I booked through priceline which I could care less what they paid because I got a great deal.) I asked for two rooms to be on the same floor again and told him I would be happy to come back if two rooms on the same floor was not avail. now but avail. later. He said no, didn't bother checking, gave me my keys and said this is all we had available. I took the keys, took the family out for late lunch, came back at around 4 p.m. and double checked with a frontdesk person to see if we could get two of the rooms on the same floor. The woman that helped us said sorry for the delay as she checked. She placed three of our rooms on the same floor without any problem. Tip. Rooms facing the Coit Tower are quieter that the other side.

"hotel_143","hotel_5186","Nice Amenities, Location We are frequent travelers to San Francisco for a 2-3 day quick getaway. Normally I book a room through Pricelines bidding process and end up with the Hyatt Regency on the Embarcadero. This trip we got the supposedly 4 star Hilton in the Financial District. Like many other reviewers, we liked the decor of the room. And also loved the Crabtree and Evelyn shampoos. The bed was comfortable with nice linens as you would expect in a 4 star hotel, but I felt the room was small. The window wall had a 3 ft wide desk (with only one chair) that made it sorta uncomfortable to look out at the street. You had to lean up against it to look out. Not a big deal but I like having a table with chairs near the window so you can order room service and sit and enjoy. We had to eat our champagne brunch on the bed which was uncomfortable. My biggest complaint about the hotel is the way they treat you if you buy through Priceline. They denied having a king sized bed for us even though I called early on to request one. The reception person said they only had smoking rooms with king. Even though I felt they were ruining our romantic weekend I accepted the 2 double room. It was miniature and not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel, no matter what price you pay. I requested to see the king size smoking room and it smelled very strong of smoke. At this point I asked to speak with the manager and asked her if she could help us out. She put us in a normal room with a king size bed and a nice view of coit tower, alcatraz..etc. I expressed to her we felt punished because we bought on priceline. She said they used priceline because they wanted people to come and stay again, that it was a way to get the word out about the hotel. I told her that giving the worst rooms to priceline buyers was completely defeating the purpose because they would get bad reviews. She was very nice and polite and we appreciated the view room. I also must mention that the street noise even at the 22nd floor was VERY LOUD. Apparently they did not upgrade the windows when they converted this hotel from a Holiday Inn to a Hilton. We did not have a restful sleep. It was crazy the amount of noise...Kells bar was right across the way. 2am was the worst noise.  We did like the location near Chinatown. We never took a cab once. You can walk to North Beach too. We used the cable car to get down to the Ferry Building and have dim sum at Yank Sing. YUM! That place is awesome. Overall a nice weekend, with a few inconveniences.

"hotel_143","hotel_2111","Great Experience We enjoyed a Saturday night stay and had a wonderful experience. Nice lobby. The clerk at check in was friendly and efficient and went to the effort of searching for the room upgrade we asked for. Our room looked dead-on at Coit Tower with partial bay views. Room was extremely clean and decent-sized although the bathroom was small. Furnishings and decor appeared to be in excellent condition, not worn out or tired looking at all. Noise in other rooms and the hallways was pretty much non-existent (although there was some construction going on next door that resulted in a generator going off at 6am on Sunday morning!). Sunday morning we had an awesome breakfast in the hotel restaurant - fairly reasonable at $35 for 2. I would definitely recommend this hotel for either a business or a leisure traveler, although simply due to the relatively small size of a standard room it probably wouldn't be the ideal hotel for any longer than a couple of nights.","May 11, 2006","5","4",6,5,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$236"

Good valet service and very friendly and polite.5. A great king bed and v. good llinens. Good towels in the bathroom.6. Free wi-fi in the lobby area. Works good too. 7. New, fast, elevators. One slight catch is that you have to swipe your room keycard before you push the floor button or it doesn't accept your push. The price of 9/11.The Bad:1. Noisy outside. Drunks all over the place when the bars close.2. Five in the afternoon and unable to get clean towels. They ran out(??)3. Generally overpriced. Want to spend $35 on breakfast?The Ugly:1. Parking will be about $100 for two nights (we're still here as I write this). SF is always expensive, but this is out of line. In summary:I got this room for $90 on Priceline. Good deal for that price. If I had paid rack rate or anything like it, I'd really be sore. This is a made over Holiday Inn, and looks like it. The rooms are furnished with IKEA-level stuff. Nice for a young person's apartment, but not for a 4 star hotel. Popcorn (acuostical) ceiling -- they just couldn't spend the $$ to take this out and it looks really dated and ugly. We had stayed here when it was a Hol. Inn, and that's about the level of hotel it still is--only more expensive. Interesting, Hilton is trying to lose the Chinatown identification. Was the Holiday Inn Chinatown -- now the Hilton Financial District. Never mind that all the businesses outsite the hotel have their sineage in Chinese. This place only makes sense at under $100 and it's a good value for that.","Apr 29, 2006","13","11",4,4,1,3,1,4,1,"4","$236"

"hotel_143","hotel_5659","A Great Option to Union Square Hotels I spent six nights at the Hilton and from check-in to check-out everything went smoothly. The room was nicely furnished, spacious, and quiet. The bed was comfortable with a surplus of large pillows to select from. The window opened just a crack so fresh air could be let in. My view from the 18th floor was overlooking Chinatown so it wasn't anything special. After reading the other reviews I will ask for a room on the opposite side next time I stay there. The restaurant and lounge are pleasant spots to enjoy a meal or drink. All of the servers I encountered were well trained, courteous, and efficient. The only downside I experienced was the showerhead in the bathroom is so low that I had to bend way over to get water on my head, neck, and shoulders. I am only 6'2 but I bumped my head on the shower curtain rod when stepping into the shower, and when I raised the shower head above my neck water sprayed over the shower curtain and onto the floor making it quite slippery. An NBA team would not be happy with the room showers.I loved the location as everything was within walking distance--Union Square, Chinatown, Embarcadero, and Fisherman's Wharf. It took me just 20 minutes to walk to ATT Park to enjoy a Giants baseball game.

"hotel_143","hotel_6144","WOW! Hilton reborn! Exquisite hotel Wow, where do I start?We arrived to the Hilton Financial District and were immediately cringing at the industrial look and bland exterior of the Hilton. so much for first impressions!We walked into a pleasant lobby with few bells and whistles but a VERY effecient staff. I work for a 4 star resort in Carmel, CA and I know when a hotel staff hates their job. This staff seemed very happy and professional.so far, nothing great. Then we hit the room! What a GEM! The rooms were obviously recently remodeled and were very nice. But the physical characteristics of the room was not the star...that belonged to the view!A beautiful, stunning view was waiting for us when we opened the blinds.Picture this. A view of Chinatown to your extreme left. Alcatraz to your middle left. Coit Tower in the middle. The San Francisco Bay to your right and Treasure Island to your extreme right. By far, the greatest view I've ever had in my numerous trips to SF. I have thought about that view at least ten times a day since leaving. You must ask for a higher floor when staying. It's essential!From that point on, our trip and our hotel stay were a dream. The amazing king bed with a featherbed mattress was to die for! These beds rival the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay and Quail Lodge in Carmel (routinely known as the best beds in the area)! Room service was fast and effecient, plus the food quality was above average. All requests to the front desk were fulfilled promptly and swiftly. Now, you may be wondering why I would give the hotel 4 stars after an obvious 5 star review. Well, like all hotels in SF, the Hilton institutes a ridiculously overpriced parking fee. This time, it was $44 nightly and then there is a $6 parking tax on top of that! That's right folks, $100 for the privilege of parking. Luckily, I got a great deal on the room rate to compensate for this. But until SF hotels change their ways and institute REASONABLE parking charges, I will not give any hotel 5 stars in SF. Upon check-out we did have a minor issue. We were never given a ticket when we handed the car to Valet. We figured it would be sorted by room number. So after we checked out, we were asked for our ticket. When I explained we didn't have one, the valet service was quite rude and said, Oh YOU WERE GIVEN A TICKET!, like I would lie about it LOL. Luckily for this guy, I had already had a wonderful trip and felt it wasn't necessary to engage in a ummm pee pee contest with him (no swearing in reviews). Plus I overheard he had 308 checkouts that day so, all is forgiven!So all in all, stay here! There are too many bad decisions you can make when booking a hotel in SF, go with a sure thing. Plus, it's well below the other hotels in the area in terms of price. What more do you need?Thank you for reading my long winded review.","Apr 15, 2006","16","15",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$236"

The Financial District is very smart whilst this hotel is in the slightly seedy China Town district. I think the hotel would like to think it is in the Financial District but it is not. It is on Kearney Street that also houses a Subway sandwich shop, a chinese supermarket and an adult video store.The staff at the hotel are very helpful except for housekeeping. I asked for extra pillows but was told that there was a shortage so I couldn't have any.The room was quite small but was clean and tidy and had a great view. The roof pool was nice, if a bit cold. There was no changing facilities next to the pool so we had to travel back to the room wet via the lift.All in all, this is not a bad hotel but I do think $32 per night parking is a bit steep.If you go to China Town, eat at the Great Eastern on Washington Street.

This hotel is easy to spot on last minute hotel anonymous services as it is the ONLY hotel in the area with a SPA. What keeps this from being a 4 star property? A lack of restaurants on-site. But excellent restaurants are within walking distance, and the room service is good, though pricey. Both visits we were given rooms on the North side, facing Nob Hill, with bay views to either side of Coit Tower. Service is excellent. The desk clerk saw that I was with my wife so he made sure to find us a room with a bathtub instead of just a shower. Parking is very expensive - $32 a day on weekends.

Adjacent to Chinatown and 2 blocks to North Beach Italian Neighborhood.Trendy Spa located within hotel. Spacious and clean lobby, with a rather nice if empty cocktail lounge. Convenient Restaurant on 2nd Floor. Interesting Chinese Cultural Center on the 3rd floor, with seasonal exhibits, art, tapestries, Oriental puppetry and Gift Shop. We caught some young students in beautiful silky ethnic clothing, singing and dancing on stage. Outside on the deck, you'll see many locals practicing their Tai Chi. Walk across the limited hour pedestrial bridge and go into Chinatown onto bustling and colorful Grant Avenue. Walk two blocks up Kearney to Columbus Avenue- the heart of North Beach. Francis Ford Coppola's Restaurant on corner of Kearney  Columbus. Historic City Lights bookstore is right nearby. Busy Broadway and wonderful Restaurants all around. Convenient #15 Muni bus stops in front of hotel will take you to Fisherman's Wharf if you choose not to walk. California Street Cable Car is only 3 - 4 blocks from hotel. I suggest this location for the repeat or return visitor to San Francisco, after you've done all the shopping and such in Union Square. This neighborhood is much more pleasant with respect to the terrible terrible terrible homeless problem that Mayor Emeritus Brown fostered. You can walk back to your hotel after a nice Chinese or Italian dinner without being bombarded by dozens of street persons. Nice views, nice pool on roof. Guest rooms are amply spaced and relatively clean. Great view on the Bayview side. Business Center is merely a computer, printer, and calculator- but it's pleasant enough.

Much nicer hotels could be had for the same price. The location is great but this hotel has not been updated since the 1970's. The bathroom is very small. The door barely clears the toilet which is flanked by the sink and bathtub. The other problem is that it is a full flight of stairs up from the street (most guests use the $35/day parking garage). It does have good security- you cannot access the guest floor elevators without a room key. I was disappointed by SF Chinatown. It was empty Friday and Saturday nights so was not conducive to much exploring. Stores and restaurants were open but very few people in the streets.

We stayed at the holiday inn from 6-13 nov 2004,the hotel is an average 3 star but the views from the hotel are second to none.If possible ask for a bay view room on a high floor,the views of the bay are breathtaking.The best thing about this hotel is the location,across the road from Portsmouth Square,the heart of Chinatown,a 5 minute walk to North Beach the Italian district and 15 minutes either direction walking to the shopping district of Civic Square and the tourist thoroughfare of Fisherman,s Wharf,definately 10 out of 10 for location.For breakfast i would reccomend the Garden Restaurant outside the hotel,on the left,as breakfast in the hotel is overpriced and poor,similaly if you need a camera film etc the hotel shop is way overpiced so walk across to Chinatown and get your goods in the shops there.We would stay here again but that is down to the location,the best in San Fransisco,rather than the hotel itself...........","Nov 16, 2004","6","6",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$236"

I wish I had'nt bothered.The location was fantastic, 10 min stroll to Downtown SF for excellent shopping/cinema etc......10 min trolley car ride to The Wharf, SF's best chinese restaurant (in my view) just up the road (House of Nanking).The check in staff were rude, abrupt and not at all helpful. The room had a bay-view which was great, BUT - there was a building site directly opposite which started work very early each day. Also we had asked for a high floor, as hotel is on a very busy intersection of roads. We were placed quite low to street which was also noisey - DESPITE being assured by the hotel in numerous e-mails in the weeks leading up to the vacation that we would be placed fairly high up.With a lack of sleep on the first nite we asked to be moved. The front desk were again rude, and not very helpful, offering a room on the other side of the hotel on the same floor!Housekeeping staff were great, keeping the room immaculate and very friendly.I do not like to complain when on holiday, as I am there to enjoy myself and let things wash over me, but - I felt the problems above REALLY soured my stay in the beautiful city of SF.

Rooms are in decent shape, but ours did not seem to be newly renovated. There was a big empty place, where a lounge chair was supposed to be (hotel pictures), but when i tried to get one, the man gave the impression as if he would not know what i was talking about and he brought a normal chair. the next morning i then saw these lounge chairs in other rooms that were being cleaned. Our room however did remain without one for the whole stay.nothing wrong with the hotel, but average is the correct description. the location is fine, you can walk to many places.

"hotel_143","hotel_5232","Not that impressed Considering all the rave reviews listed here I was expecting more than your average hotel. We stayed for 5 nights at the Holiday Inn Downtown and Spa (Sept 5 - 10, 2004). The hotel staff wasn't overly friendly. Not rude but they didn't go out of their way. Upon checkout the customer service agent didn't even ask how our stay was. I guess it is too hard to ask guest where they are from, why they are in town, how they like San Francisco, please come again, etc. The room was small but clean. Nothing fancy. No internet access/computers for guest. I was told there was a Business Centre in the works but if I wanted to check my e-mail I had to walk 7 blocks to Kinkos. For the price we paid I expected more hospitality. However, it seems we paid for the location. Some extra things to mention.What we liked: The hotel is located on the corner of China Town, the Financial district, and North Beach. Easy access to great food!There is a cool rooftop pool. Bring your swim suits and spend a day enjoying the views from here (Coit Tower, TranAmerica, Bay/Ocean). We didn't bring our swimsuits but wished we had.What we didn't like:3 -4 blocks to the nearest Cable Car stop. Most of the main attractions are along the Cable Car routes. The morning walk to the cable car stop was fine. However at night I couldn't walk fast enough to the hotel! Too many shady/homeless people around hotel - especially on Kearny street.","Sep 11, 2004","1","1",3,4,1,4,1,3,1,"4","$236"

The rooms are spotless, recently renovated, and the decor rivals far more expensive chains. Staff is helpful, not overly friendly-no complaints there.

After arriving at the Holiday Inn from a great hotel in NY, we did not have high expectations of this hotel. How wrong we were!!We checked in and managed to get great rooms with superb bay views. The rooms were a good size with everything in working order. Staff at check-in were polite and helpful along with the concierge. Took breakfast every day in the hotel which was great value and enjoyed the lounge in the evening. The location is perfect, quiet, but within a 15 minute walk of all the major attractions and 2 blocks from the cable cars. There is a great roof top pool with fantastic bay views.What really makes this hotel stand out is the friendliness of the staff. A big thanks to Liz on checkout, she has customer service down to a fine art. We had the most wonderful housekeeper. Not only did she keep our rooms spotless, she also gave us great advice on Chinese festivals that were taking place that we probably would have missed. She gave us info on how to get around, locations, sightseeing and always had a big smile. Thank-you Mu Zhen.San Francisco is the friendliest city I have ever visited, apart from my home city of course... the staff here are part of that experience.

"hotel_143","hotel_1389","Great week in a great location! Chose this hotel largely because of its location and we weren't disappointed. We didn't want to stay at Fishermans Wharf - too tacky and as it turned out other reviews about the Union Square area proved correct. San Francisco is a fantastic city but they really do need to sort out the problem of the homeless folk - very intimidating especially of an evening. Whereas, from this hotel we were able to wander about Chinatown, down Columbus Avenue for Italian food, up to the main cable car routes and even into Union Square feeling comfortable and safe. Admittedly there's nothing open beyond 6pm in the financial district, but with everything else close by it wasn't a problem.The hotel was bog-standard Holiday Inn but nothing wrong with that - at least we knew exactly what we were geting - which isn't always the case, especially when you are booking into older hotels in NYC etc. Our rooms were in good order and housekeeping did their job admirably and efficiently. On check-in the receptionist was exceptionally helpful securing us our desired adjoining rooms, high up on the 20th floor with a magnificent bay view - can't fault the service. We were more than happy with our choice of hotel, had a great weeks stay and would recommend it to anyone.","Aug 5, 2004","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$236"
"hotel_143","hotel_9000","Holiday Inn Select Downtown  Sometimes available for significantly less than the HI properties on Columbus near Fisherman's Wharf, this high-rise hotel at the edge of Chinatown and the Financial District provides convenient access to many of the city's great sights. You won't have any problem getting your bearings, since the HI Select is located right next to the Transamerica Tower. If you have the opportunity, we would particularly recommend the 27th Floor rooms with their high ceilings, balconies, robes and access to a small business center with complimentary wireless internet access via one computer with a printer. (This is one of those few hotels in the U.S. where having Priority Club gold status MAY actually get you something if you get the right desk clerk on the right day.)The closest BART/metro station is at Montgomery  Market, an easy seven block walk. (Take Montgomery Street for wider sidewalks and more impressive buildings than you will see walking on Kearny. There is an alleyway on the south side of the hotel that provides easy access to the front door.) It is also a pleasant walk through Chinatown and North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf, though you can catch the California Street cable car line two blocks from the hotel. We prefer the city hotel ambiance of the Holiday Inn Select Downtown  Spa to the two HI Fisherman's Wharf properties. The Bell Captain was an especially noteworthy asset to the place during our visit. Four elevators serve the tower adequately, though there can be small traffic jams during peak hours if any happen to be out of service because they are not oversized. There is direct access to the Chinese Cultural Center from the third floor. Housekeeping and general condition of this hotel were both very good during our visit and PC members receive a $10 value amenity coupon that can be used toward the restaurant, cocktails or an in-room movie. For overall value in San Francisco, we give this property an A and highly recommend it.","Jun 8, 2004","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$236"

Don't buy anything in the hotel shop, outragous prices and the lady working there didn't even speak or smile. Don't let that put you off though.

When we came back the unit was simply turned off. It was never looked at. As a result, we had an engineer in our room at 9:30 in the evening when we wanted to call it a night after a long day of touring wine country. The engineer told me he gets this complaint all the time, but there is nothing he can do to fix it. He told me I should just turn it off if I want it quiet to sleep. After he left, the wall unit actually fell out of the wall. He had to come back to push it back in. Niiice. The entire hotel is small and dirty. I stay at Marriotts to get away from these sort of dumpy conditions. I would have rather been a bit further away and had nicer accomodations. The real thing that makes me angry is that when I booked through the Marriott 800 number, I asked them which was better, this or the one on Nob Hill. They gave me no indication that this one was such a pit. It's actually rated as a catagory 6 by the Marriott company. There is NO WAY.

"hotel_145","hotel_7445","Nice hotel for a quick business meeting. Stayed at the Marriott San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf for a quick business meeting. This is a medium sized 4 story hotel that is between the Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach Areas. Small lobby, small bar area and a small sit down restaurant greet you when you check in. Check in was very efficient and quick. They have only two elevators and there is often a wait--catch them going down to go up! Stairs are not available for use between floors for some reason. Once you get up to your room there can be a bit of a walk to your room.Rooms are average sized--separate bathroom with shower-tub combo, bed, desk, table, chair. Minibar in room, no safe was available. Coffee maker available. I was on the third floor facing Columbus Ave. and was worried about the noise, but did not hear anything at night! Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable.Used the small gym which had a couple of flat screen TVs, a couple of treadmills, single elliptical and a single recumbent bike. A few machines and free weight sets were available. There are two laundry machines in the gym area. Fresh fruit and water were available. No one was staffing the room.Meeting rooms were good for our meeting. Rooms are downstairs from the lobby and they had connecting stairs.Food in the restaurant was OK. The food issue is not a big deal, if you are visiting San Francisco, you will always be eating out!Location is good given the proximity to the Fisherman's Wharf area and a few block walk to the Italian North Beach area. Concierge set us up with a local Italian restaurant--very nice place. If you take public transportation, the hotel is nearby bus routes.Valet parking is available--about $40 dollars a day. There is no self parking.Hotel was very busy when we were there--a combination of conventioneers and bus tour groups.

What a suprise! No one ever called to address this theft. Which brings me to the issue as to why there was not a safe avail in the room?

I stayed here for 3 nights and found the staff to be unfriendly  inexperienced and the hotel generally dirty and outdated.Let me break it down for you.Front Desk  Room Service: The front desk would not answer phone calls nor would room service. To place an order for room service you must leave a message detailing your order and wait for them to call back. On average it took about 30 minutes for room service to call back. When room service items were placed outside the room, they were not removed for days. You could see various plates with leftover food, bottles of wine, coffee cups and all sorts scattered throughout the hallways. This occured every day during my stay.Lobby Bar:Beware of the bar. On my last night at the Marriott I went down to the bar for drinks. There was only one bartender and she was clearly overwhelmed. She was not familiar with many cocktails and was surly with guests. I don't blame her, she should have had help. At one point she had to leave to get ingredients from the kitchen and the bar turned into a chaotic mess.For $300 a night, you would expect this hotel to be clean  comfortable and the staff friendly  experienced.

The room had several nice touches like a Tempurpedic type matress, nice linens and duvets. In room refrigerator and a window that opens were all nice touches. The concierge couldn't have been nicer and arranged Alcatraz tour tix on short notice. My only complaint was the brkfst buffet was pretty pricey, but there are some great local brkfst places close by the staff recommended.

The room was a nice size, quiet, older, but clean. (Refrigerator would have been nice though) The hotel staff extemely helpful. We requested an early check-in (11am) and they did everything to make this possible, we checked in at 10am. Two nice breakfast places nearby, Buena Vista Cafe (YUM!) and favorite (the name escapes me..Mary's?) on corner of Columbus and Beach on the west side of Joseph Conrad Park. Public transportation so easy from here!!! A convenient Columbus St bus stop nearby (travels right to North Beach, Chinatown...), F-line around the corner (Pier 39, Ferry Building) and cable cars just a few blocks away (Union Square). Always easy to find our way back from every part of the city. Remember... not 5 star... we were not expecting it but were pleasantly surprised.","May 7, 2008","2","2",4,4,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_1765","SF Marriott Fisherman's Wharf STINKS!!!! I am so unsatisfied with this hotel that I could not wait another minute to write this review. First off, I called the hotel the previous night to confirm the payment and make sure the charges were to be on the specified card. When we got there, Michael (rude hotel staff member) told me in order to check in I would need the original credit card and photo id. The problem is my mother kindly agreed to pay for the stay. So we had to call my mother at work, have it faxed over and wait. Keep in mind we had to catch a alcatraz trip in 15 min. When I asked how to get there, I was told its 10 minutes walking distance. I said well ok that still doesnt tell me much? Then he said oh its pier 39. That type of short service is very typical of the staff here. Even when we got back from alcatraz I asked to speak to a manager (Alexander) which wasnt any better. When I told him of my unsatisfactory service he told me well now that your better and calmed down from earlier you should talk to our concierge staff to show you some stuff to do in san francisco. Yeah like I'm going to take advice from the unhelpful hotel staff. To top it off my mother called the night before check-out to say they charged her WAY too much. I spoke to another manager (from England) who told me in the most blatantly disrespect tone that he knows what he is talking about and my mother is wrong about what is being charged to the room. Now I think MY MOTHER KNOWS what she is talking about when it comes to what is being charged to her credit card. Its a shame I had to deal with this on my birthday weekend especially when I wanted to stay at the argonaut hotel instead but it was booked (for good reason). Avoid this hotel as it has the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!I wrote the previous posting the night before check-out thinking that was it but I was wrong. The morning of check-out I went to take a shower and was about a minute into doing so when the water from the shower head starting coming out in pulsating spurts which then turned to it spewing out YELLOW WATER. I immediately turned off the water and told my boyfriend to look as the water came out yellow (in addition to the faucet). We called the front desk who said they would send an engineer to fix the problem. Since we had plans for the day we told them we need to shower in another room. 30 minutes later a maid gave us a room key two floors down at the end of the hallway to shower. There was no explanations given or apologies for the inconvienience by the management whatsoever. Due to the ordeal we were unable to do what we had originally planned. I truly hope in writing this review others can be spared from theseexperiences.","Apr 12, 2008","8","3",2,4,3,4,2,2,3,"4","$287"

It's in a good location if you want to be near touristy sights--Fisherman's Wharf, Giradelli Square, Pier 39--but it is far away from the city center.Also, the hotel is badly in need of an upgrade. The rooms were decorated with wallpaper border and acoustic ceilings from the 70s. Walls were paper thin--we even heard our next door neighbors zipping their suitcases in the morning. Management was happy to move us after we complained about barking dogs at 8 a.m. Staff was friendly, but hotel is a bit shabby for the $200/nt price. Perhaps that's what it costs to stay in SF!We had a great dinner at One Market in the Embarcadero area.

The bed was extremely comfortable--like sleeping on a cloud. I would try to buy some food for the room, as breakfast can be expensive in restaurants and at the hotel. The highlight of the trip was the concierge, I believe his name is John.

"hotel_145","hotel_9833","""Great location but expensive"" We visited this hotel as a gift from a very generous uncle. The hotel had the clean, high standard finish you would expect of any Marriot. The location is literally 2 minutes from fishermans wharf but the hotel doesnt benefit from any stunning views of the wharf or the golden gate bridge from any windows. It has an almost dwarfed apperance and in honesty looks more like a motel; It is only once inside you see the luxury. We had a hire car with us and were told there was no where to park in the vicinty and had no choice but to take advantage of the hotels garage which we thought would be free or at a discount at least for residents...but it actually cost 拢45 for 2 nights parking!! Our room cost alot and this on top was extortionate espcially as my partners uncle was paying for it I couldnt enjoy our stay as much thinking about it. On the upside our room was great and the bed very comfy but purly on extreme lack of value for money I would go else where next time.","Mar 15, 2008","0","0",4,5,6,5,4,4,1,"4","$287"

Enjoyed the sitting area near the bar with the fireplace and table service from the bartender. Friendly staff. Excellent breakfast bar but a bit pricey. My husband and I would happily stay here again and recommend it to any traveler. One drawback was the significant walk from the elevator to our room. If walking is a problem, travelers should specifically ask for rooms closer to the elevator. But, that's a nit when you are away from home for vacation.

The concierge gave GREAT recommendations on restaurants; he hit the mark 3 out of 3 times, exactly what we were looking for at the moment. We especially recommend the Steps of Rome Cafe on Columbus St. (next door to a sister restaurant, the Steps of Rome Trattoria which we hear is good also, but more expensive.)We also recommend the Pescatore Cafe, near the hotel, and also Alioto's on Fisherman's Wharf. We were delighted by the beautiful gardens on Alcatraz, the view of the city skyline from the now closed prison, boat trip over and back, and self-guided tour of the place. We also enjoyed the nearby dockside tour of the liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien, and submarine USS Pampanito. The Muir Woods (redwoods) site across the Golden Gate bridge was inspiring and also the Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen (Sonoma Valley), and their practice of sustainable and biodynamic farming, plus their fabulous guided tour and wine tasting. We rented a minivan right around the corner from the Marriott (Avis) for about $100 for the day, and drove to Muir Woods, Sonoma, and Glen Ellen, and ended the day watching the sun set over the Pacific from Golden Gate Park.

Weather aside our stay was excellent. The accomodations were better than expected. The room, on the 4th floor(of a 5 story facility), included a refrigerator, was clean and roomy. The bathroom was large and the shower worked well. The staff from the front desk, bellmen as well as the phone and housekeeping personnel were responsive and helpful. The concierge team(3 different individuals) were extraordinarily helpful.The in-house restaurant was a litle pricey but the breakfast buffet was excellent. The hotel was near 2 cable car routes as well as 3 buses that basically took us all over the city. We did not rent a car because, in part, parking at $40(+14%tax) for parking was outrageous. There were 2 supermarkets within 2 blocks which were able to meet all of our needs.By the way we are both light sleepers and I must say the rooms were quiet.I would recommend it.","Jan 17, 2008","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$287"

We were always greeted on entry. The hotel's location is an excellent position within walking distance of all the attractions such as Pier 39, Alcatraz tour  Sightseeing tour buses.The City  Alcatraz tour bus picks up from the hotel.Some things were expensive such as items from the mini bar and bottled water but we didn't use any of these.We did have breakfast in the restaurant one morning and it was very good for the price. The chef in there was quite a character.Parking is also very expensive, as it is in all of Fisherman's Wharf. I think it was $38 per day + tips for valet only parking.Parking did not worry us however, as we parked our car in a multi story near Budget Hire on Beach road.

Rooms are well equiped with coffee maker, robes, nice toiltries, iron and a TV. Daily internet charge is a pain and should be included in the price. Workout facilities were quite nice and clean. Daily valet parking was a bit steep at $40/day, but was reliable and fairly quick. The breakfast buffet was pretty low quality and uninspiiring (basic danish, toast, cereal, eggs, fruit, etc.) for the price and the variety did not change much daily which is a bit dull if you are staying a few nights.

Within walking distance to convenience stores, museums, Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39, cable car stops, and downtown.My problem here was bad service which I complained about all the way to Marriott Corporate. Our entire stay, the front desk was manned maybe once the whole time. Had payment problems (not our problem, and not one we ever experienced at another Marriott) at check-in which were compounded by a rude clerk.Cell phones would not work in building, which was nobody's fault. But when our family tried to contact us by calling the hotel number, though, nobody would answer the phone to patch them through for our entire trip just about! We had a death of a friend while we were staying here... we did not know about it because our family could not get anyone at the hotel to answer the phone!!Had I not been interested in collecting my Marriott Rewards points, we would have got a refund and checked into the Holiday Inn across the street. We actually contemplated it, and talked to the Holiday Inn staff (who were much nicer) but decided to tough it out since it was just a 4-day trip.Not a fun anniversary though. I really LOVE Marriott 鈥?usually 鈥?but this property was horrendous simply because of the staff.

"hotel_145","hotel_10224","Awesome hotel. The only reason why I have not rated this hotel excellent is because it is not smack in the center of happening place. Living in this hotel you would definitely feel a much relaxed type of atmosphere. Don't expect it be like what you would see in a downtown area young kids roaming around till late. If you want the local culture feeling, I highly recommend you stay at Fisherman's Wharf. Lots of local little cafes around to eat breakfast/brunch/lunch. Hardly any bars around. However, walk to Little Italy (only few blocks) and you will find slew of strip clubs, resturants, and few bars. Chinatown is also right around the cornor from Little Italy. If you want the feeling of Michigan Ave area of Chicago, with high end stores around, stay at Union Square or downtown hotels. However, at Fisherman's Wharf, you will find enough street parking for FREE and won't have to pay the hotel so much money for parking. The breakfast at this hotel is not bad at all...good food, good price. If you get a nice server, she may even provide some food for free. She waived off part of the charge for our brunch. This hotel will literally provide you with town's map and draw your walking route for you. They are overly helpful and nice staff. I loved them all very much.The hotels service is definitely the best ever I have experienced. The concierge literally spent 1/2 hr with me on 2 occasions to help me figure out what I could do on my vaccation. He even looked up a resturant's menu for me (me being vegetarian) and called the resturant to make a reservation for me. The hotel carries free chargers for ton of cell phones so if you ever forget your charger, talk to them.

"hotel_145","hotel_2546","Great Service, Great Location, Comfy Beds! We booked a one-night stay at the Marriott at Fisherman's Wharf using our Marriott rewards points. In previous experiences, I've had hotels and airlines treat me worse because I used points instead of dollars to pay for services and stays. This was definitely not the case here!We arrived at the hotel at 9:00 A.M. (seven hours before check-in time, which is 4:00 P.M.), hoping to drop our bags off with the bellman before doing some sight-seeing. Not only were we treated kindly by the woman at the front desk, but she found us a free room and let us check-in immediately, free of cost! When we told her we'd be leaving for the airport at 4:00 A.M. the next morning, she offered to let us pay our overnight parking in advance so we'd have one less thing to take care of when we checked out. Overnight parking was $40, which seemed steep, but it's less than the cost of the cab ride to the airport. The room was huge with a gigantic, super comfortable king-size bed, overflowing with pillows of all shapes and firmnesses. The second we lay down to relax for a moment, we never wanted to get up. The robes were comfortable enough that I nearly considered paying the $50 to take one home with me. Bathroom was very clean with a huge tub and all the amenities except for conditioner. Hotel employees were kind, giving us directions to everywhere we wanted to go. The valet parking guys were a bit slow to get the car, but not slow enough for us to complain about.We didn't have time to try the food, but ordered two Californian wine flights from room service ($13 each) and they were delivered promptly. The only negative about our stay was that we had to drag ourselves out of that amazingly comfy bed at 4:00 in the morning.

We found the concierge to be particularly nice, he suggested great restaurants, and pretty much arranged our car-rental for us, when we mentioned that we were interested in hiring a car for a few days. The only fault was the price of eating in the hotel. We had breakfast in the hotel the first morning and were charged in excess of $30 for 2 omletettes for some juice etc. That was the last time we ate there, favouring the Denny's or I-Hop in Fishermans Wharf for breakfast from there on.

The hotel is small and older but well maintained. Our room was clean and check-in was easy. The hotel advertised their new luxurious beds but they were a disappointment--much too soft for a good night's sleep. The only thing that would keep me from staying here again is the parking fee--a whopping $40 per day! The worst part is that there is a public parking lot one block north and two blocks east that only charges $6.00/ day. I really hate it when I feel that I have been taken advantage of like that.

"hotel_145","hotel_6804","no sheet - this hotel is almost perfect I would have rated this hotel perfect except for one small detail -yes, they do have very comfortable pillow top beds but the hotel is using standard size sheets which are not large enough to accomodate the extra thickness of the pillow top mattress.The result is a sheet which keeps flipping off of the mattress corners, making for a very annoying nights sleep. On the positive side, the hotel was very nice with very helpful personnel at the front desk, clean and quiet rooms, and very close to all of the major attractions.

Kudos to all of the staff for their friendly, knowledgable advice. My only complaint was that on the last day I became quite sick. I stayed in while my friends did a Napa Valley tour. I wanted to order room service and found out that you may only order lunch between 12:00- 1:00. Now when I see a room service menu that boasts all day it should mean all day'.

This hotel was in a good location with the Fisherman's Wharf attractions within walking distance as well as numerous other San Francisco attractions. All of the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful but the cleanlinest of the hotel room needed improvement. Our room was nice but we noticed dirt on a wall and a stain on the chair. The shower curtain also had a stain. In the restaurant we noticed some dust along a shelf. I think the cleaning staff needs to be better trained. There's no pool in the hotel but we didn't miss it because of all the sightseeing we did around town and the cool temperatures in San Francisco. There was a small fitness center on-site which came in handy. I would say this was a decent 3 star hotel.","May 31, 2007","1","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$287"

It would have been nice to have a microwave in the room to reheat leftovers and reheat coffee. We tried to find one in the hotel bar but there wasn't one there either. The furniture is dated but in good shape. We were close to many great attractions and the metro bus stop is just outside the hotel. The trolley is just a couple blocks away.

The place was clean and the staff was very nice. The lobby has a nice lounge area which has a fireplace. It was nice to come in from the cold and walk in to a nice warm fireside.

The food was good, but pretty pricey. There is a Denny's within a block and other chain restaurants so you don't have to eat the $14 pancakes.

"hotel_145","hotel_3997","Spacious rooms, Lush beds, and helpful staff We are not fans of Fisherman's Wharf and always choose Starwood over Marriot, but we completely enjoyed our short stay here. We live an hour out of town, but as my husband was a guest speaker, the sponsoring group booked the hotel. The rooms are spacious, quiet and the amenities (bath and body aromatherapy) are great. The beds aren't as good as the Westin, but if you want to stay in Fisherman's Wharf this is a great option on the almost luxury side. The hotel doesn't have any charachter and it is a shame not to enjoy the great old hotels downtown. It is a standard business hotel. For the money, the St. Francis, the Palace or any of the big old Union Square hotels are more fun and steps to great museums, shopping and restaurants. Also - for tourists, unless you have a car, it is a bother to get to fisherman's wharf. Parking is $35. Amtrak stops a mile away and BART is downtown. If you do have a car, always remember it is easier to get to Fisherman's wharf over the Golden Gate than 101/Bay Bridge.","Feb 2, 2007","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$287"

"hotel_145","hotel_1377","I expected a little more from a Marriott Now don't get me wrong. This hotel is in a great location, and it has a nice bar downstairs. The hotel is updated nicely. However, I always check the beds at hotels no matter where I stay. I pulled back the blankets  found all kinds of hair in my bed, from pubic hair to head hair, and the sheets were a little stained. I immediately became disgusted  called downstairs. The manager came up  I showed him the bed. It was obvious that the bed had just been made  the sheets had not been changed. So he took us to another room on the same floor. This room had the same problem, which I clearly showed him. He moved us again to another room, at which point I simply asked for clean sheets to be brought to our room  I would make the bed myself. The clean sheets that were brought to our room had not hair on them, proving my point that the sheets had not been changed in the other rooms. The manager simply gave us 2 free breakfast tickets for the next morning. I thought that was kind of cheap of him. This was the Marriott which prides itself on service, and here the maids had not been changing the sheets, and I had to make my own bed. I was really dissapointed in the managers choice of compensation  we haven't stayed at a marriot since. Customer Service is really important  this manager seems to have forgotten that. Check your bed the next time you think about staying here.","Nov 16, 2006","14","9",3,3,6,2,4,3,1,"4","$287"

"hotel_145","hotel_10620","Can't beat the bed!!! I stayed 3 nights in October for a conference at a nearby hotel.The exterior of the hotel is kind of drab and the lobby and halls show some signs of wear. However, at least for this hotel, the saying that you can't judge a book by it's cover holds true; the room was outstanding. I stayed in a basic room that had 2 queen beds since that was all that was left and I had a cheap (government) rate. It was easy to darken the room and the bed was extremely comfortable. I haven't slept so well in a hotel room bed in years! Starbucks coffee was provided free of charge, can't beat that. The bath amenities were also a nice touch.While it's not news to me, it still bothers me that most nice hotels ask for an additional fee for high speed internet access, and the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf does not buck this trend. It's one thing that would cause me to grade this hotel down.The hotel has a good location if you are going to be doing a lot of tourism activities or if you have a conference or other business to do in the Fisherman's Wharf area. If instead you have other business in San Francisco, I would consider staying downtown or near the Union Square area, as it's easier to reach other areas in SF from there. Still, it is easy to get to the cable cars and F street car line from the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf, it'll just take you longer to get places.I paid $140/night plus tax for the room and based on other hotels in San Francisco I would say this is quite fair. If you're asked to pay up to $200/night for this room, I'd say you've got a good deal. If the going rate is more than that, I'd say only stay here if your stay coincides with a peak time, such as a convention or other event.","Oct 30, 2006","8","8",6,6,5,5,5,6,4,"4","$287"

The hotel restaurant is also an excellent choice with resonable prices. The breakfast buffet is the best around. I travel frequently and actually look forward to staying here. I'm on an expense account but if I weren't I would object to the high price for parking your car at the hotel. I believe it was $43 with tax per day.

The price we paid included overnight parking at a savings of $8.00 per day off the usual rack rate. The rooms were clean, including the bathroom, and have very comfortable pillow top beds and comfy pillows, perfect after a day of walking to take in all the sites.We opted for breakfast at the nearby Denny's and the nearby IHOP, both clean with quick service and lots of food for the kids.Had dinner one night in the restaurant and it was ok; nothing to rave about but wasn't bad, either.I'd recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.","Sep 2, 2006","5","5",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$287"

"hotel_145","hotel_4662","Great location in San Francisco My wife and I traveled to San Francisco and surrounding areas to celebrate our 25th anniversary. One of our stays - three nights - was at the Fisherman's Wharf Marriott.The location was great for us as we wanted to take in the wharf, Alcatraz, Chinatown and other close-by sights. Everything was within walking distance with the exception of Chinatown, but that is easy to get to with trolleys.The room was very nice. Not much of a view here as this hotel does not tower over the surrounding cityscape. Again, location was what attracted us to begin with.When we arrived we were greeted warmly and congratulated on our 25th anniversary (I had advised them of this special occasion prior to our arrival). The hotel lounge was having a wine tasting affair when we arrived, so we found a table and relaxed with great wine, cheese, crackers and grapes. One of the staff greeted us as well and made the early evening even more enjoyable with great conversation and suggestions for our visit to SF.On the second evening we were sent up a bottle of champagne and a dozen HUGE chocolate covered fresh strawberries! A wonderful gift from the staff that made the evening that much more enjoyable. Thanks! You guys know how to make a stay enjoyable!We ate breakfast every morning at the hotel and enjoyed the variety of foods available with fresh fruits, juices, pastries, bagels, eggs, made-to-order omlettes and great tasting coffee to start the day.Evenings we found restaurants around the area. Everyone has their own tastes. We ate a casual Mexican dinner at a place nearby the first night. The second we walked down to the wharf and put our name in (1 hour wait) at Scoma's. Great food, great location and view of the wharf. It would be nice if they updated the 1960's veneered wall paneling...maybe that's the ambience and I just don't get it. Not a cheap dinner, with a couple of glasses of wine each we hit $120.There were a number of other hotels around this area to choose. We are Marriott fans and this one does not disappoint.

"hotel_145","hotel_1915","Memorable Stay My girlfriend and I decided to book a trip for our Christmas present to each other. As she interned in San Francisco during college, we decided to head out there for some RR. As I usually make the travel plans, I choose this hotel based on the Marriot name, the excellent location, and the ambiance of the place. *Check In-No problems with check in. We got in around noon, and were easily checked in to our room. Each time we dealt with the front desk, they went above and beyond professional customer service to take care of us. *Room-The room more than suited our needs. Granted, we did not have the best view (The record store across the street), but the room was rather beautiful. As some may have read, the BEDS were probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in, including my own! I think they use plush down comforters, but I slept so beautifully each night.*Breakfast at the Restaurant-I live in Jersey City, across the Hudson from Manhattan. I know expensive places, and am accustomed to them. With that said, I also realize hotels jack up the prices of their food. However, the price of the breakfast was close to $30, quite expensive! Food was pretty good, but this was not the best value.*Bar-The bar was a nice place to relax, watch some sports and get a drink while my girlfriend got ready to go out. The drinks were somewhat expensive, but again, living in the NYC area, I am used to paying $5-7 for a Heineken. This was the same. Besides the pricing, it had a nice ambiance to it*Conceirge-Well, the good news of the trip was that I proposed to my girlfriend, now fiance! The night of the proposal, I wanted to take her to a nice restaurant. The conceirge was so helpful in getting us a nice romantic place to eat at. He was also excited for us. I work in a service oriented industry, where customer service makes or breaks a company. He certainly was very professional and courteous. He even remembered our engagement the next night he was working and congratulated us again!*Location-The location was pretty descent for us. Although my fiance is not into staying in touristy areas, she did enjoy the location of our hotel, as it was close to alot of places and/or public transportation. It was not too far from Fisherman's Wharf, and was a quiet part of town. The only downside to Fisherman's Wharf was the overpriced restuarants serving breakfast. Living in NYC, breakfast is cheap, even in a Manhattan diner. However, here, could not find french toast for less than $10-12. *ParkingWe flew out and took a taxi to the hotel from SFO, so we did not have to pay for parking. However, I did see it was rather expensive, so I would advise not parking in their lot. *OVERALL-This place met all our needs. They were courteous, the beds were extremely comfortable, and you cannot beat the location. I would definitely reccommend this hotel to someone traveling to Fisherman's Wharf!!","Jul 21, 2006","16","15",5,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$287"

The only criticism I have was the attitude of some of the restaurant staff and who provided a second rate service. The hotel is positioned only a couple of blocks from the heart of Fisherman's Wharf close to lots of restaurants and bars and made the ideal base.Car parking is expensive at 39 dollars a night, we parked on the street but had to change sides each night for the street cleaning which was a pain but a lot cheaper.We would certainly stay here again.","Jul 8, 2006","3","3",6,5,1,6,1,3,1,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_3735","Great Stay Just came back from a three day/two night weekend Reward (i.e. free via points) stay here. The top three things were 1) Great Bed! 2) Customer Service and 3) Location. Although I usually don't pay attention too much to Customer Service (even in reading other reviews) since it can vary so wildly depending on who you interact with or the day that particular person is having, I'd have to say it was beyond excellent on all counts. We chose this hotel because they were the only Marriott that was dog friendly and the staff was not only attentive and cordial, but they actually seemed to take a lot pride in their job. And it shows. The King Bed was beyond superb and the location was right in the mix of a lot of tourist attractions. I am a CA native so I rated the location #3 as the Wharf area is a bit junky in spots, but more than acceptable.We ordered room service one night and the North Beach Pannini was excellent. The bar in the lobby was a bit quiet but had a lot of atmosphere going for it and we enjoyed it.If you can, try to get up early one morning (we did it about 7am) and take a walk to and through the Wharf. The sun rising over the barking seals nearby with almost no tourists around was really something to see. The crowds can get crazy anytime after 10am until ??? and the peacefulness of strolling along the docks and shops is well worth it even if you don't bother to take a shower to ensure an early morning start.","Jun 18, 2006","6","6",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$287"

It's not a particularly smart place but the room was clean and tidy (as are the vast majority of Marriott properties in my experience). The only real problem we had is that the first room we were given was next to the ice machine and it was unbearably noisy. The staff were very quick to respond to our request to move rooms (although they didn't appear at all surprised so this may be a common problem). We were offered a couple of alternatives and settle on a room one floor below. Shortly after we had settled in, the concierge appeared at our door with gifts for our son by way of an apology for him getting to bed so late (not that he minded too much!)

Parking - very convenient in a garage next door at a REASONABLE overnight price.But the best thing is - very little local street traffic - it was easy to get in and out of parking, zip over to Golden Gate park, get on the 101 to the Golden Gate Bridge - or even drive up over Lombard hill.We had the best 'tourist' visit to SF of dozens of trips I've made there.The hotel was very acceptible on price, room amenities, and free broadband. I'd stay there for business in a heartbeat.I do agree that it's not as 'spectacular' a property as many full service Marriott's but the location made up for it!","Apr 29, 2006","6","6",6,5,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_4105","Not the best Marriott (more like coutyard property) I was in town for business and styed at Marriott Fisherman's Wharf because the other Marriott in downtown was sold out. I should have just stayed at another hotel in a different location. This place was not up to par. It had a marriott courtyard/holiday inn feel. Eyerything about this place was old and outdated. The chairs in the lobby was worn out and stained. My room was very noisy, heard the traffic noise all through the night and the heater smelled like milldew so I kept it off. The room was on the small side and the bathroom was especially small. The bath products were nice (from bed bath). The bedding looked new and clean but found the bed to be too soft. The gym was small and had old star trac equipments.","Apr 28, 2006","8","4",2,3,1,4,1,3,1,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_9437","Good Hotel, Great Beds, Superior Location Hotel has all of the normal attributes you'd expect of a Marriott except there is no pool. Nice rooms, clean surroundings and a fine restaurant. The location is the key to this hotel. It is very close to the Wharf, Cable Cars lines, bus lines and area attractions. Other comparable hotels in the area to compare against are a Sheraton, a Hilton and a Hyatt. All are within a block or two of each other. There are also second tier chains in the same area (i.e. Holiday Inn). We stayed over spring break and Easter and had a terrific time. The beds are outstanding. If you are going to Alcatraz, be sure to book your tickets in advance. The only ferry that lets you off on the island to explore is ----. We ran into a couple who bought at the ticket window and were told it was sold out but that they could purchase a costly tour that would take them on the same ferry but also included other destinations they were not interested in. We stayed a week and were totally pleased. The front desk staff and concierge were helpful in suggesting activities each day. You may also want to call the concierge before you leave on your trip to ask any questions you may have. I found this particularly helpful in getting the right transportation from the airport to the hotel.","Apr 22, 2006","8","8",5,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$287"

"hotel_145","hotel_6208","Absolutly Excellent Experience Where can I begin?!! The Marriott Fishermans Wharf is located within a block of the Fishermans Wharf and is walkable to Gheradeli Square, Pier 39, Wharf Restaurants and the northern Embarcadaro. The hotel is older, and has a 70's archatecture design, but is very up to date inside. The staff is fabulous and will do anything to make your stay enjoyable. The rooms are fairly large for being in a large city. The hotel has a great business center and health club and has a Starbucks branch inside. The hotels restaurant has fairly good breakfast's and offers dinners at a fairly inflated price. Obviously, everything is extremly expensive in California in general, but is a little more at the hotel (i.e. parking $38, 2 starbucks and 2 scones $12, breakfast buffet $18) but overlooking the cost, the city is absoluly gorgous and the staff at Marriott Fishermans Wharf is likly to please you as they did me....","Apr 16, 2006","7","6",5,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_6599","Nice Hotel Spent 7 nights here,second week in April 2005.Great holiday arranged with Expedia.Rooms warm,quiet and beds extremely comfortable.This is our second Marriot visit[the other being Marriot at Brooklyn Bridge}On both ocassions we found the beds so comfortable we were sorry to leave them at the end of the week.The great thing about the hotel is the location.It is actually a few blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf and non the worse for that.It is right next to the 30 and 47 bus stops which will get you anywhere interesting even though you may have to change.The bus system is brilliantly simple and very cheap.By far the best way to get around.The concierges were helpful and polite as were all the staff.Apart from the obvious trips and excursions around San Fransico we also went to Yosemite and Monteray /Carmel.Yosemite is awe inspiring and well worth the expensive fare and lenghth of day out{14 hours}.The driver Walter was a real card,maybe not to everyone's taste, but definitly a character.Not to sure about Carmel and Monteray.The only inspirational part of the journey was between Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz.After that the scenery deteriorates.Witness the ugly power station and pylons at one end of Monteray bay.Monteray is a hell hole of touristy shops and attractions.My advice,walk the opposite way from the crowds and head south along the water front.17 mile drive will impres you if you are inspired by golf courses and rich folks' homes.If not you may be in for a disapointment.The beach at Carmel is nice and I would advise you to head straight there unless you are turned on by shops.We would have had a better day on the Murin peninsula or Cliff house and Lands end.The latter would have only cost 3 dollars on thje bus.Eat out in China town.Great value for money and walkable from Hotel or take the 30 bus.Wonderful holiday.I left my heart in San Fransisco as well as the most comfy beds in the West.","Apr 11, 2006","10","8",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$287"

"hotel_145","hotel_5822","Enjoyed this hotel - great location My husband and I stayed at the Marriott in Fisherman's Wharf for 3 nights in Feb. We had wanted to stay at the downtown Marriott (since we were staying on Marriott points) but it was not available. We were very pleased with the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf.The hotel is in a great location for tourists. Steps away from great food, entertainment, shopping, and all of the tour companies. We were able to walk or take public transportation everywhere within San Fran.The hotel staff was so friendly (Margie in the dining room was so nice) - and the concierge (Mike) was super helpful. They really went out of their way to help.The hotel is small and lacks that big city Marriott feel and the shape of it is odd. Since it only has 4 or 5 floors, you can hear noise on the street level. The bed may have been the most comfortable bed that I have EVER slept in!We didn't eat much in the hotel - except for breakfast - it was a nice buffett for a hotel.Overall, we had a great time!

"hotel_145","hotel_4974","Great Location My husband and I just returned from a 3 day trip to San Francisco. We stayed at the Marriott at Fisherman's Wharf for the whole trip and loved it! The location was great! I'd been to San Francisco before and knew renting a car was a bad idea (minimal parking and $30/night to park at hotel) so staying at a hotel convenient to the sights was key. We requested a non-smoking king room, but were informed they couldn't guarantee the king part When we arrived all they had left were rooms with 2 doubles, but I believe it is a non smoking hotel, which was really nice. The beds were VERY comfortable. Down pillows and comforters, room darkening shades - all key for a good night sleep after a day of touring. I wasn't expecting much of a view from our 4th floor room, but surprisingly we could see the bay and golden gate bridge. The starbucks coffee in the room was nice. I heard the hotel restaurant was good, but we only got a couple pieces of fruit from the breakfast buffet. Which cost us $3.50 - ouch. The hotel concierge was very helpful. We spoke with him every day and he gave great advice and plenty of maps of the city and wine country.Overall, staying at this hotel really helped to make our stay in San Francisco memorable due to the convenient location to Fisherman's Wharf, restaurants, Lombard Street, Ghiradelli - walking distance to EVERYTHING!","Feb 21, 2006","8","7",5,6,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_1788","Not the worst but not the best hotel in San Francisco I purchased 1 night at this hotel for $75.00/night through priceline.This hotel needs some desparate renovations. It looks very outdated. The lobby wasn't well lit, neither were the hallways.Our room had sticky carpet and didn't feel clean, neither did the comforter/blankets. The alarm clock was dusty and looked like it was from the early 90s. It was very difficult to walk around in the room since it was crowded.Parking in the garage was $25/night (you pay that for parking almost in most hotels in San Francisco).I didn't get a warm fuzzy sensation or happy feeling staying at this hotel and I didn't feel like it was worth my money.","Dec 20, 2005","10","3",3,3,1,3,1,4,1,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_8343","Nice Hotel, great Location I stayed at this hotel on a business trip earlier this month. It is in a great location with lots of things to do and see within walking distance. The cable car turnaround is about a block and a half away from the hotel. It can take you up to Chinatown or other places. The only bad thing about the hotel is that it is not a high rise but very spread out and in a triangle shape. There is only one set of elevators in one corner of the triangle. My room was on the opposite side so there was a lot of walking from the room to the elevator. This may not normally be a big deal to you, but I was at a seminar and when we have breaks, I like to go to my room and check messages, freshen up, etc. But with it being such a long walk, it was time to start back by the time I got to my room. My only meal at the hotel was room service. Seafood gumbo in a sourdough bread bowl. It was pretty good. From the wharf a couple of blocks away, you can see the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges. It is a beautiful place.","Dec 14, 2005","9","8",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_1880","Fantastic time was enjoyed I Arrived at the hotel from the airport via a shuttle bus service, no problem. We had flown over from England, so we were a bit tired, even though it was only 7 PM local time, to us it was 3 in the morning. We stayed up for as long as we could but gave in at 9PM. I must say I had the best nights sleep I had had in a long time the bed was sooo comfortable. Got up early the next day and started to explore, the hotel is very well situated for all the touristy things at Fishermans wharf and the bus and tram services were all close by as well. We did everything that tourist do, Alcatraz (close by) Biked the bridge(close by) Lombard street (close by). We also went to Cobbs comedy club which is just up the street from the hotel. We ordered room service a couple of times, which was excellent. Overall I would say, a quality hotel in a quality location, in a quality city.","Dec 14, 2005","9","9",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$287"
"hotel_145","hotel_8811","Some Glitches in the Execution If I had written this review after our first night's stay, I would have been livid. Since our second night was immensely better, our stay averages out to, well, average.I was travelling with two teens. I reserved a room with two double beds. When I arrived, they told me no, I had reserved a room with one king-size bed. I pointed at the two kids and said, Well, we have THREE people here. They offered us a rollaway bed that she magnanimously said they'd comp. I later checked my confirmation e-mail. It did indeed say I was guaranteed two double beds. Luckily, my daughter wasn't picky and was fine with the rollaway. My younger daughter and I luxuriated on what has to be one of the comfiest beds on the planet. The Marriott offers featherbeds and down comforters -- perfect for chilly San Francisco.About 9pm, I heard the people in the next room fumbling with the lock of the connecting door. Twenty minutes later, smoke started filling our non-smoking room. The smell was clearly wafting in via a draft coming through the connecting door. The roomservice gal smelled it, and said it was worse in the hallway. I called customer service, they said they'd call the room next door and remind them that they were in a non-smoking room, and to call again if the problem continued. The smell soon subsided, and we eventually went to bed.At 3am, I was awakened by loud noises (party-like) next door and my room was filling with smoke again. The phone doesn't have a front desk button and apparently customer service isn't staffed at 3am. The phone rang and rang. I dressed, went down to the first floor, and complained about the smoke (which physically makes me ill). The front desk staff called the other room, but I would have appreciated some conciliatory noises like gee, sorry that you had to go through this. It took another half-hour for the extra people in the other room to go home, and for the smoke to dissipate. By this time, I was wide awake and too upset to get back to sleep. The next morning, I called Customer Service yet again to ask if the party next door was staying over another night. If so, I wanted to be moved. I got the puzzling reply that they had checked out. Since they'd been wide awake and noisy at 3:30am, I was darned surprised that they'd be awake enough to check out by 7am. Besides, the privacy notice was still on the door. I assumed they knew what they were talking about, and we all went out sightseeing.Somewhere around 2 or 3pm, we returned. Our room was smoky again. I asked for, and received, a transfer to a new room -- this time, one with the two double beds I had asked for in the first place. This time, the front desk staff was suitably sympathetic. We had to walk 3-4 rooms down the hallway before we left the smoky miasma behind. Luckily, our new room smelled fresh and sweet. A burned-out light bulb in our bed lamp was taken care of in minutes. Our second night was heavenly, and I took back all the bad things I said about the Marriott the night before.We were on the 5th floor, and didn't hear a bit of traffic with the windows closed. The concierges were extremely helpful regarding sightseeing: they recommended the best dim sum place in Chinatown, and advised me on the best time of day to catch a cable car without waiting in line. They were pure gold.If you check the Marriott website, you can get a better deal than Expedia or Orbitz. The normal rate for Thanksgiving weekend was $150/night plus $38/night for parking. I got a deal for $170/night on the Marriott website, including parking, or $199/night including parking, breakfast for your party, a $20 gift gas certificate at Chevron, and a discount coupon for Macy's. Which reminds me, the breakfast was excellent. In addition to the usual fare that you might find on a hotel breakfast buffet, they also had made-to-order omelettes with your choice of ingredients, cheese blintzes, and eggs benedict, among the less-common offerings. Service was also excellent, the orange juice was fresh-squeezed, and the fruit was extra-fresh.The Marriott's location is conveniently near the cable car turnaround, the Cannery, the shops and restaurants of Fisherman's Wharf, and a slightly longer hike to Pier 39. Public transportation from this location is plentiful, so park your car and enjoy the city.The loud smoky next-door neighbors weren't the Marriott's fault. If they hadn't been there, I probably would have loved my stay at Marriott, despite the bed glitch at check-in. Give them a try.","Dec 3, 2005","14","11",4,5,1,6,1,4,1,"4","$287"

The hotel was mediocre. It seemed clean enough, but the room we were allocated overlooking the courtyard had the noisiest air conditioning unit I've ever heard - even after a 12 hour flight we couldn't sleep!

"hotel_145","hotel_4763","Disappointed - Marriott Platinum Member Despite being in a great location, this was the sixth hotel on our summer trip to the West Coast, and somewhat of a disappointment comparing to other hotels (Marriott, Best Western and others).Had to change rooms after the first night because of an odor in the hallway, although Hotel Manager receptive to our needs by morning. Hotel layout is not optimal [60's 'design', need I say more] and in need of an uplift, although rooms were clean and quiet. Breakfast area somewhat congested, but omelettes a nice touch.Recommend requesting a room near the elevators, otherwise walking will be on your excercise program. And, ask about full parking rates, including tax on the service (and then, consider parking a few blocks away on some of the residential streets like we did!). Cannot beat the location if first visit to San Francisco, as within short walk to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf.

"hotel_145","hotel_5454","The Marriott was great! After much hand wringing of where to stay in San Francisco with a 16 yr old and a 14 yr old on a family vacation, I finally choose the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf (primarily because I'm a big Marriott Rewards member). I had read varying reviews of this hotel and also had several recommendations from San Francisco regulars to stay near Union Square or in the Financial District . . . not tacky Fisherman's Wharf.Well, I'm glad I didn't listen to them! In my opinion, if you are in SF for a short time with kids, the Fisherman's Wharf area is a perfect place to base your operations. The Marriott hotel was great! Nice lobby. Nice bar. Free internet (with 2 computers and a printer) in the Business Center. Very accommodating staff. Beds were terrific. Typical Marriott furniture and decor. Very close to the Cable Car lines. A full service Safeway grocery store a block away. Lots of restaurants (including fast food -- In and Out, Burger King, McDonalds) close-by. You can walk to Lombard Street, Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf (Pier 39) and easily catch the boats to Alcatraz.It's true that parking is expensive, but it is everywhere in this city. Take my recommendation and avoid the hassle. Don't rent a car... you don't need one. You can walk, take a taxi, or buy an all day muni  cable car pass for $9/person and get anywhere you want to go. We did that one day and explored downtown, visited the Cable Car Museum, went to China Town and even searched out the house in Mrs. Doubtfire and Lombard School from the Princess Diaries. It was great fun and our kids loved exploring and riding the cable cars.","Jun 26, 2005","13","13",5,4,1,5,1,6,1,"4","$287"

I read some reviews that complained of the noise - well here's the deal---you're in the middle of the city - there's noise. Personally, I like it. I like the hustle  bustle of the city - it get me moving and helps me to start my day.

"hotel_150","hotel_2034","Nicely renovated and large room, but terrible front staff service I just got back from my stay at the Maxwell Hotel, soon to be Frank Hotel. I had stayed in one of the renovated executive king rooms of the hotel. The room itself was nice since it had been recently renovated(art deco design). The other added bonus was the large size of the room. It was 310 sq feet. That was pretty much the only positive of the hotel. I had originally booked the room through the hotel's website and at that time had also signed up for the hotel's rewards account. Upon arrival of the hotel, not only did the staff personal that helped me check in tell me I had not applied the rewards account, but had also refused the look at the confirmation letter I had printed up after the reservation online with the rewards account clearly on the reservation. Since she had a [--] attitude and did not want to really wanted to be bothered with, I went ahead and continued to check in an got my keys to the room. Upon arrival of the room, it look nice, but had a view of the backside of the building. I had noticed the room was right across from house keepings. Nothing occurred of the location of the room until maybe after an hour later, I kept hearing the house keeping room being open and closed. Everytime it closed it would slam and it was heard from my room. Aside from the slamming of the door, everytime there was a laundry shoot drop you can hear the metal. It felt as though there was a lightening storm. I only realized it was not when I went outside of the hotel and noticed that it was cloudy, but there was no thunder at all. This basically happened from the hours of 8 am to 5 pm on the 3 nights I had stayed there. Be forewarned the pressure on the shower head is very low. You literally have to stand right under the shower head and just wait for it to drip on you.Having stayed in other hotels within the same vicinity, the rooms may not have been as large as the one at the maxwell hotel, but the staff personal treatment more than made up for the difference.","Dec 31, 2008","0","0",3,4,6,4,2,2,2,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_6690","Hesitant, but Great Stay I used priceline and got this hotel. After reading reviews, I was somewhat hesitant about staying here.However, once I arrived, I was happily surprised. Yes, definitely there was some street noise (I was on the 7th floor), but this hotel is in the heart of downtown. So, if that's your thing, it really can't be beat. And with that information in hand, I just brought some of those soft ear plugs and I was fine to sleep.The room and bathroom were clean and comfy. I didn't notice any spots on the carpet and while there was some wear and tear , it was nothing that I haven't seen in my own home or other hotels. The bathroom was nice and the room seemed plenty spacious. Plus, per some other reivews, since I don't really watch TV, the limited channel scope wasn't really a concern.The front desk and staff were very helpful. And, I got lucky because I found a parking spot a block away. It was Saturday night so parking was free on Sunday. Bonus.Overall, I enjoyed the experience at the Maxwell. I used to live in San Francisco and I'm not really into the whole downtown thing. Yet, having the hotel in such close proximity was pretty fun and I found myself getting up a little earlier just to explore a bit before I had to go to the airport.","Oct 1, 2008","0","0",5,5,5,5,6,5,5,"3","$211"

"hotel_150","hotel_7117","Art Deco Wonder My recent stay at the Maxwell was wonderful. When placing the reservation, I was informed that it was under renovation, but I was not troubled by the work being done. In fact, I barely noticed the tell-tale signs of construction. I arrived hours before check-in, and the front desk staff worked to check me into a room that was ready instead of making me wait until later that afternoon. Though given a interior room instead of a street view, I had a beautiful room.The front desk staff -- upon learning it was my first visit and only 48 hours to spend in San Francisco-- went out of their way to recommend the best places to see in the city, how to get there, and what to do. They checked up with me upon each stop back into the hotel and made sure I was okay and enjoying myself.I found it to be a wonderful place, and though a little disappointed to know that it will lose its art deco appeal in the remodel, I would recommend this hotel to everyone -- both now and after the remodel is completed.","Aug 14, 2008","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_7664","Sleepless at the Maxwell - it's NOISY AT NIGHT!! The hotel is located on the corner of Geary and Mason, and right across Mason is Biscuits and Blues, a blues club. The window of our third-floor room was apparently made of Saran Wrap, because from 10 pm to 4 am on Saturday and Sunday nights, we heard it ALL: the music, the drunk hooting and hollering, the horns blaring (?!). Then at around 5, the garbage trucks came to pick up the huge dumpsters full of beer bottles and what-not that were stationed directly below the hotel. It was a horrible experience. I am extremely annoyed because when I called to make the reservation two weeks prior to our check-in date, I asked about the noise level at night due to the renovation. The person dutifully told me that the renovation stopped at 4:30 pm and resumed at 7:30 am so there would be no noise coming from the renovation. They must get a thousand complaints a year about their flimsy windows and the noise from the blues club, though. I think he purposely did not mention the potential for street noise, though he could have suggested that we request a room on the other side of the hotel, perhaps. So, the noise level, plus the really poor customer service, shabby and germy room, terrible mattress, Third-World bathroom...I would not go back to the Maxwell (soon to be the Hotel Frank after the renovation) if they paid me.","Aug 5, 2008","0","0",2,2,2,2,2,3,1,"3","$211"

"hotel_150","hotel_4230","Great location, insist in refurbished rooms Upon arrival we were upgraded to a corner suite because we were going to stay for 7 nights. The room given (309) needed a total renovation. As out travel agent had assured us that we were booked a renovated room we insisted on changing to another room but both the front desk person and the concierge assured us that there were no renovated rooms in the hotel. We insisted on changing hotel and were promised that the manger would answer us the next day. Room 309 was worn out and especially the bathroom was not clean and was cold becuase the window did not close tightly. The windows offered no sound inulation and we were able to sleep some hours only because the sound of the aircon (needed to be turned on all night long to keep us warm) was strong enough to cover the sounds from the streets. The next day the manager changed us to a completely renovated stylish and confortable room (408), so the front desk manager and concierge had lied about the lack of such rooms.","Jun 17, 2008","1","1",4,5,6,5,2,2,4,"3","$211"

"hotel_150","hotel_4845","Location: awesome Noise: baaad!!! Me and my boyfriend have been visiting the city for years. We always like to try new places and we decided to try the maxwell based on its' proximity to the masonic center, where we were going to a concert. The location is excellent, it is within walking distance from everywhere we wanted to go, like cool bars and restaurants. the staff was very friendly, and our room was small but cute. We've stayed in many older hotels and are not phased by small rooms or hallways. Charming' would be how I would sum up the decor. However, the only reason I'm not giving this a glowing review is because of the noise. I'm not talking about other guests, but the maid service at 8 in the morning! After hearing loud talking and banging around in the next room, I assumed it was guests loudly getting ready to leave. However, when I heard the vacuum cleaner, I realized it was the maids being loud from approximately 7:45-9:30am!!! What the hell?? checkout time is not until noon (another plus in my book) so why wake us up at 8 in the morning??? I was furious and almost considered calling the front desk or banging on the wall but decided against it. I might consider staying there again, but I will be sure to request a room far away from the gathering of the maids in the wee hours of the morning.","May 30, 2008","0","0",4,5,6,4,6,5,4,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_4629","Great Location in Union Square My friend and I wanted to head out to San Francisco for Memorial Day weekend. We booked this hotel through the vacation package option on Priceline. The only thing we knew was that we wanted to stay in the heart of the city. This hotel is definitely in a fabulous location for the 'big city' feel. You're within walking distance to all of the major department stores (Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Saks) and other great shops. The restaurants around the hotel are excellent and you're a couple blocks away from Market St. which is where most of the bus and trolley lines pick up. The hotel itself is old, they're actually remodeling it this fall, but it has a really cute old Hollywood feel to it. The rooms are tiny, ignore the pictures on the site, you won't get that room. But they are plenty big for people who are there to see the city and not hang out in the room. It does get loud at night as there are a few bars that have late closing times, but turning on the air conditioning unit completely eliminates the crowd noise.

But it was fine for the night. The one thing that I must warn you all on though is the noise at night!!!! We were in bed by 1am, but the rest of the city was still out partying until about 4am.

When we were notified that our hotel would be the Maxwell, I immediately came to this site to read the reviews. Honestly, I was a bit concerned because the reviews weren't great.  However, when I saw the room I was relieved and excited! We got upgraded to one of their remodeled suites. They are upgrading and changing their name to Hotel Frank in the fall of 2008. The new room was exactly that, brand new. It even smelled a bit of paint. We had a large, comfortable bed, new carpets, modern-looking lamps and fantastic toiletries in the bathroom. We also had a decent view (street and King George Hotel). The TV was a brand new, flat screen that was much larger that what we have at home.  Yes, the hallways are still narrow, the elevator is painfully slow and the water pressure in the shower is lousy. But, we still enjoyed our stay and would come back when the hotel is fully upgraded.","May 11, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,5,6,6,1,"3","$211"

The hotel were still under renovations for the new look, if it looks now as they promised, it should be looking very modern. As soon as i registered I were informed that i was up-graded to another room. I didn't ask why but i had a bigger room than the one i booked, very spacious with two sofas and a table. I felt like i was at home. The bathroom was very clean and in general everyone at the hotel were always friendly. I always felt welcome. The hotel is very good located, everything is light walk distance, you can also take the BART to the airport, which is very convenient.

Normally one expects old to have a certain charm but not at the Maxwell -- here it's just old. On the positive side, the room was quiet and the highspeed internet was fairly fast so it wasn't a complete waist.

"hotel_150","hotel_9885","Good Stay For $75/night on Priceline, I felt I got a good value at the Maxwell Hotel. Yes, it is an older hotel with small (but very clean and functional bathrooms) and narrow corridors and elevators. However, it is in the heart of San Francisco--close access to the cable cars down to the wharf and all other trendy neighborhoods are within easy walking distance. Staff was not exceptional, but friendly enough and accommodating. They gave me a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite (queen bed and sleep sofa) when I asked if they had a room with two beds, because my automatic reservation was for only one queen bed via priceline.The hotel will soon be undergoing renovations to turn it into a true boutique hotel with flat screen TVs and the like--I say get a great 75-100 dollar rate while you can at this hotel and enjoy the central location and charms of an older building. I think the problem many previous reviewers had with this hotel was their own expectations--not the hotel itself. Of course, there were a few car horn and ambulance noises at night, but it's in the middle of the city! Relax and recognize a good value for what a good value is--that being said I would probably not pay much over 75-95/night for this hotel.","Mar 17, 2008","2","1",5,4,6,4,5,4,5,"3","$211"

"hotel_150","hotel_4218","Decent spot  We stayed at the Maxwell from Dec 12-16. We picked the hotel based upon location as we needed to be close to South of Market for my husband's work and wanted to be close to BART and within walking distance of many amenities. We know San Francisco very well, so we know exactly what Union Square is about with its attendant noise and the tourist stuff to avoid. Sure, you can hear the noise of the city from hotels around there--it's a given, so either bring earplugs or stay somewhere else. We got a decent rate on Expedia. However, since we require a smoking room our options are always limited, which again we mostly understand. Still, the room we were first put into was pretty depressing. Avoid room 216! Not only is it small, it has a weird layout (narrow long hallway between sleeping area and bathroom) and worst of all the only window looks out into an airshaft in which are all the mechanical systems and fans and blowers, etc for the hotel. So not only is it a noise source, there is absolutely no view and it makes the room dark. The darkness is ok for sleeping, but a total bummer during the day. We asked to change rooms but they had nothing else until the 3rd day of our stay. They did allow me to look at the other room first before I decided so that was nice. We switched to room 210 which had a big window overlooking Mason st. There was a lot more street noise but it was worth it for the ability to people watch out the window and not feel like we were in some cave. We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant or order room service so I don't know what th quality level is there. For a light breakfast I suggest walking over to Caffee Kuletos on Powell, just south of Union Square. http://www.kuletos.com/cafe/cafekuletos.shtml They have excellent espresso and delicious sandwiches on baguettes as well as pastries. Both rooms we stayed in were on the ok level. Mattresses were fine, the rooms were clean enough if a bit worn. The first room was missing the ice bucket and we wanted extra pillows and ashtray which were brought to us quite quickly. It would have been nice to have a refrigerator in the room. I'm not sure why the Maxwell doesn't include that. There is no coffee maker, either, but with such great espresso nearby we didn't care. We requested a late checkout and were accommodated with no problem. The staff were nice enough, overall. With so many hotels to choose from I'm not sure if I'd stay there again, but I don't have any ill-will toward the Maxwell.","Dec 17, 2007","1","1",4,4,5,4,4,4,1,"3","$211"

"hotel_150","hotel_3426","The Maxwell was a totally great experience for us! We stayed at the Mazwell the night of Saturday 09/29/07. Orginally, we had booked three nights, but the week before we arrived, we reduced our reservation to one night based on the reviews (especially as they related to the noise level) that we had read here. Based upon our experience at the Maxwell, we wished that we had stayed the full three nights! Bottom line, we will definitely stay again on our next visit to SF.Upon arrival, the desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. Example: we were offered a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite. We did not see the regular rooms, but the junior suite was awesome: spacious, windows on two sides, spotless, and with lots of nice touches (like a shower massage shower head in the beautifully-tiled bathroom). Noise was NOT an issue for us. As some other reviewers have noted, there is a bar on the short side of the building at street level. We were on the opposite end of the building.If you are sensitive to noise, I'd suggest requesting a room away from the bar side of the building if reserving by phone, and calling the hotel directly if reserving via the Internet. Note that the Maxwell's in-house restaurant is quiet; it's a separate bar around the corner from the Maxwell entrance (but in the same building) that could be a problem. So, be clear about that when talking to the hotel about getting a room away from the bar. Some other things:1. The hotel's free wireless wireless Wi-Fi was both reliable and fast2. The location is phenomenal. Trust me if you haven't been to San Francisco before 3. The hotel has a definite art deco design motif, which was an added bonus (though you may not care)4. I did notice that the lobby carpeting was dirty. I didn't really care -- given the location and the volume of human traffic, I would be willing to bet that the adjacent Westin Hotel's lobby carpet was just as dirty5. The elevator was could have moved more quickly, but I've been on plenty that were slower. BTW, we never waited more than 20 seconds for the elevator","Oct 13, 2007","0","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_4314","Beware the bed bugs! I booked this hotel because of a good rate offered on Travelocity (in deference to my budgeting travel partner) and its decent locaton. Because it was Fleet Week, Columbus Day weekend (Italian American Heritage Parade in North Beach), and a 49'ers home game weekend we couldn't come up with many hotels that had availabilities for Friday and Saturday.The lobby is charming but the room was a little worn - fine for European standards but not quite the Courtyard Marriott in cleanliness and amenities! Yes, Aveda products - but no refrigerator. Carpet looked dirty. The tiles in the bathroom were painted over and the paint was coming off. The toilet tank top was a painted piece of wood. Nothing we couldn't live with! We stayed the night with no problems but the next evening, I noticed a few bites on my chest and back that were itchy.We stayed another night and left early the next morning for Sonoma/Napa on an all day trip. Throughout the day, it became obvious that I was breaking out - very badly - in bites. Even though my room was prepaid, as soon as we returned from our tour we called the Handlery for a room and checked out.I am hugely uncomfortable with at least a hundred bites on my body. I couldn't even go to work. Not only is the itching incredibly unbearable - my entire neck and chest is covered in unsightly bites.Apparently, it can take up to nine days for the welts to appear after being bitten.

After reading the TripAdvisor reviews on my return I felt I had to add my own, as I really feel this hotel is not as bad as many would think. This may be because I am English and perhaps am a little more accommodating in what I find. Our rooms (on the 6th floor) were perfectly adequate and clean, and even though they overlooked Geary Street we got used to the noise and accepted it as part of staying in central San Francisco. The chap on reception was extremely helpful when we asked if we could change rooms (for the number of beds in it). The lifts were slow and creaky but it was all part of the hotel's charm. However, the concierges were not helpful in providing us with tourist information, which we went out and discovered for ourselves. The hotel restaurant was lovely.

Myself and my partner stayed here for 4 nights at the end of August. I must admit I did check out trip advisor after booking and was then not looking forward to the stay but when we arrived everything was cool! Reception staff were friendly and helpful, conceirge was friendly and said he could help us with trips etc. I think we stayed on the 3rd floor and our room was quite big and had a king bed in it, there was a sink in the room and then a separate bathroom with a bath, shower, toilet and sink. My only grumble with the bathroom was that the shower was quite low and I'm only 5 foot 5. Yes the decor was a bit dated but it is a deco hotel so therefore not going to be modern and trendy. Our room was very clean and was cleaned daily. It also had a safe in it which was very useful. We would definately stay here again. Recommendation for breakfast is Sears just a 5 min walk away in Union Square, you do have to queue to get in but it is definately worth it but be prepared for enormous portions! Another recommendation if you like Chinese food is House of Nan King in China Town, it's quite small and doesn't look very fancy but the food is fantastic and very cheap - don't be put off by the interior!","Sep 18, 2007","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$211"

I dont think Ive ever been in a bathroom so small - the shower was mouldy and there wasnt enough room to swing a budgie in it - never mind a cat. The only redeeming feature of this hotel was a guy who was on the desk for our arrival who helped us loads with getting about and also making sure we didnt get ripped on the taxi ride to the airport.

I booked it through Travelocity - and even though they didn't process the booking in the 48 hours after I made it and I had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby for a fax to come through, it wasn't the end of the world. And there was free Wifi, which the big hotels rarely provide.HOWEVER. Returning to my hotel at the end of the evening (well, 9:30 p.m.) I discovered that one of the windows would not lock. And there was a fire escape right outside. So I called the front desk, and was told that there was nothing they could do about it (and what was the big deal? No one could get into the back alley, blah, blah, blah) except put me in a noisy smoking room on the 2nd floor. Or send up the houseman, who (and I am completely serious about this) messed with the window for 5 minutes and pronounced it locked. Except that I had already done all that before calling the front desk, and doubted it was possible. So I gave the window a shove and sure enough, it opened as easily as before. He totally pretended to have fixed the problem! Then he said there was nothing he could do, and left.So I pulled a picture off the wall and wedged it in the frame, and as I write this, I am hoping for the best.

"hotel_150","hotel_7625","The Maxwell -- Yester Year Charm My son and I stayed at the Maxwell on August 24 and 25, 2007. We booked online at a rate of $98.00 per night and picked it because of the location -- a block from Union Square - in the heart of San Francisco. The first room they put us in was on the Geary St. side on the third floor and was extremely noisy. The room also seem dirty. We asked to be moved to another room that was quieter. They then put us in a room on the 11th floor but it was $30.00 per day more. The room was bigger and seemed to have newer carpet, paint, etc. The spreads on the beds were not great and neither were the blankets on the beds -- they had stains and burn marks on them. The linens on the beds were clean though. The bath was nice sized but not large by any means. They did offer Aveda products. Parking was $29.00 per day in a garage around the corner. You do have in and out privileges through the hotel. All in all the room, parking, upgrade was expensive. The restaurant in the hotel was not open late but there are a couple of places around the corner and across the street that are. The hotel staff was nice enough but not exceptional. They did not offer maps, hotel information, or tourist information. I'll probably look for a different property next time I'm in San Francisco.","Sep 2, 2007","0","0",3,4,5,3,3,4,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_8782","Great stay for SF on a budget I stayed here as a grad student attending a conference in August. I have stayed in Union Square before and I have to say this is really a great find! It was one of the most affordable options, and I would definitely stay there again! It was very comfortable and I didn't find it shabby or lacking in any category. My room was actually surprisingly spacious - with one king bed I still could have fit a queen size air mattress on the floor if I was sharing the room w/ others, like we often do for conferences in grad school.Among its other advantages: it had great Aveda toiletry products, it had an extra sink and mirror in the room, in addition to the bathroom, and the location was perfect. It was about 1 block off Union Square, and just surrounded by shopping and restaurants. The only downfall, which was not a big deal to me, was that some of the wall decor was a little dated.I would highly recommend this hotel for any business traveler, family, or single traveler, wanting a hotel wtih a bit more character than all the chain hotels, but not wanting to sacrifice comfort.","Aug 29, 2007","1","1",6,5,6,6,5,6,6,"3","$211"

I booked a room for one night on Hotwire for $99. I was expecting the hotel to be a bit nicer than it was, but it could have been worse. I had to wait a long time to check in because there was only one front desk person and a bunch of people in front of me. However, the clerk was very friendly and gave me a voucher for a free breakfast in return for my patience. I thought that was very nice. The room was on the small side but perfect for one person. Everything was a bit shabby and that is partially due to the hotel's age. It seemed clean, though. The Aveda toiletries were a very nice touch. The queen sized bed was comfortable. There was a lot of street noise but I fixed that problem by turning on the fan. Overall, the place was not bad, but there are nicer 3-star properties in SF.

Excellent location, just off Union Square and close to everything.2. Old but clean.3. For $100 per night it is a good deal. They are now owned by a hotel chain, and their website prices are way too high. If I could get a room for less than $100 per night for one person (double bed) I would stay there again.

"hotel_150","hotel_4160","never again! For the price quoted ($195 + tax), i was expecting a bit more.As a start, yes, parking is included in the rate, but they don't have a parking! You have to unload your luggage on the sidewalk in front of the hotel (if you are lucky enough to find a spot), and then drive to the public parking round the block. Upon our arrival (7pm), no valet parking was in sight. And, even worse, not even the minimum effort was made to help us with our bags. I had to drag five bags into the lobby, while the staff stood there watching or doing something else. After check in i had to ask for someone to help me carry the suitcases upstairs. Finaly, an old concierge (who was kind of talking to himself (?)), put the suitcases on a trolly and took them to our room. The room was freezing when we entered it. It looked old, and not entirely clean. The bathroom was tiny, the tub shoebox sized. I couldn't locate the minibar in the room (but a couple of glasses and an ice box hinted at a hidden or previously existing minibar). The view? Kind of like a sitcom punchline - not a brick wall, but almost as bad - onto the heating ducts of a couple of nearby buildings. In the morning, at check out, same hassle with the luggage. I dragged it down my self to the lobby, and then out to the car (that my girlfriend went to pick up at the parking lot). No one moved. Truly subpar hotel service.

"hotel_150","hotel_10419","Paper thin walls Stayed here for my 5th wedding anniversary. I chose this hotel based on the location and the price (a bargain for $105 per night). Location was great, just by Union Square, great for shopping, dining and art collectors (there are over 5 art galleries just next to the hotel.) Also, there is a Hertz car rental within 1 minute walking distance...great if you plan to rent a car to visit Napa. However...that 's it...room was very small, bathroom was dirty when we got to the room (someone used the toilet and never flushed---first time ever that this happens to me in a hotel) and the walls are paper thin. First 3 nights couldn't sleep because you hear everything down the street...every bus...every car...everything. On the 4th night, a family with a baby apparently checked in the room next to us. The baby started crying at 2:30 am for over half an hour. I jumped out of my bed thinking it was my baby boy...but no...it was next door and I could listen to everything...the dad walking back and forth in the room, the mommy trying to make the baby sleep, etc. You can literally hear next door conversations. So, if you are not planning to sleep and just want a really cheap room and you are not picky on cleanliness (BTW, we got the $105/night rate calling direclty to the hotel--it was $140 on the web site)...then this is it.

We were with another couple who had a room on the top floor. Our room was at the end of the corridor, right next to a steep, concrete flight of steps. This was extremely dangerous as anyone could have fallen down them, but we were ok. I thought it was a bit odd, though, as there was no warning sign.Room was fine - nothing plush but it wasn't an expensive hotel. Quite dark, only a small window, with a view over Geary Street. Not that noisy but we did have ear plugs, plus we were so exhausted after arrival from the UK we would have slept through most things (not the screaming fire engine sirens, though!).Bathroom a bit old, but clean and the Aveda products were very nice. Our room had 2 double beds, pretty comfy and clean.Had a meal in the attached restaurant which was very nice, although didn't have breakfast there.The location of this hotel is excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Downsides: the room was a bit past its best and bore absolutely no resemblance to the publicity photograph of the boutique room! The lifts (elevators, whatever) were a nightmare! Really slow and always full. When we were trying to get down to the lobby to check out, we had to let at least 5 lifts go as they were already full with either guests and suitcases, or staff members with carts filling all the space.

In order not to have problem with noise from the street, we asked for a room away from street ( to be honest we still can hear noise from the street, but who cares we were tired to death, so that it doesn't affect us at all.)If we are going to San Francisco again, Maxwell definitely is our first choose.","May 19, 2007","0","0",5,5,6,5,6,6,4,"3","$211"

It's a little bit down at heel and certainly not the swankiest hotel in the world but I thought that worked for it. It was strangely quaint. Hard to describe. At check-in I was invited to take a rose from the vase on the desk and was told that I would find a vase for it in our room! Unusual touch! The room wasn't overly large but it was clean, comfortable and had a good sized bathroom. Location is fantastic! The hotel restaurant is Max's on the Square and it's ok. I had great banana pancakes for breakfast one morning! Unfortunately we only had dinner there one night because meat was brought not cooked properly. There was a great place across the road though called the Daily Grill - which is classier than it sounds! There is internet access from the hotel lobby for a reasonable charge. I really liked this hotel because it was so different and not just another chain hotel. I will definitely stay here again.","Feb 1, 2007","5","5",6,5,6,5,5,1,5,"3","$211"

"hotel_150","hotel_3635","Convenient and comfortable This is the second time at the Maxwell for me. I find it very convenient as it is a block off of Union Square, a block off the Powell Streetcar line, and 4-5 blocks from the Powell BART station.Noise is a problem here, as it is with any one of the half-dozen San Fran hotels I've stayed in over the years. San Fran has decided benevolent ignorance of noise generated by the city's numerous homeless is their best policy. For example, the street band that regularly sets up at the corner of Geary and Powell played until nearly 2am one night I was there.I stayed in one of the Executive Double Suites this time as I was expecting to have to take meetings in my hotel room. That didn't happen, but the room was perfectly capable with the addition of a few more chairs. I've never had any problem with the staff there, so I assume that request would have been honored.The ninth floor was quieter than my last visit, but still noisy for light sleepers. How noisy? If you can sleep with the AC or heat unit on, you won't be bothered except perhaps on nights when the street band is playing and the occasional emergency unit.One difference from last time is I ate dinner one night at Max's downstairs. The service was great, food good, and prices reasonable for that area of downtown. I tried twice for a quick breakfast in the morning, but I couldn't wait the 10-15 minutes so I grabbed pastry from the Starbucks a few doors down or at David's Deli one block up Geary. They do offer room service for a $5 surcharge and a 18% fee. I will stay here again next time in SF.","Jan 12, 2007","4","3",5,5,6,6,6,6,6,"3","$211"

"hotel_150","hotel_7035","Great Location for a boutique hotel We recently stayed at The MAxwell for 4 nights. We paid approx $90.00 per night booked through priceline. Considering the price we paid, in comparision to surrounding hotels, I felt the hotel was acceptable. Other hotels in the Union Square area average about $180.00 per night.With that in mind, here is what we liked about the hotel:Location--was perfect. Only a short walk to the muni/bart station, union square for shopping, and loads of restaurants and art galleries.Maxs restaurant--affordable food, good selection, convenient (basically in the hotel lobby)Staff--very effecient, helpful and courteous.The A/C in the room--worked extremely well.Here is what we disliked:Street noise--as stated in other posts, the street noise is pretty loud, and, we were in a back room, not even facing the street.The Elevators--only two, extremely small, they hold about 6 people tops. If there is a bell cart in the elevator, only about 2 other people. I waited 20 minutes one morning for an elevator on the 8th floor.The rooms were okay, very high ceilings, small bathrooms, good aveda toiletries though.Overall, if you can get a room here for under $100.00, thats a fair price for this property. I would not have been happy paying more than that.Also, keep in mind, that you are hardly ever in your room anyway (kind of like vegas) because the city has so much to offer.One thing we really liked was the Ferry building, and, if you are there on a Saturday, you must go to the farmers market and arts festival at the Ferry building, outstanding!As a point of reference, we previously stayed at The Westin St. Francis (for a bit more money) and there is absolutely NO comparision.","Nov 10, 2006","6","6",5,4,6,5,6,5,6,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_6342","Maxwell Smart- Not My wife and I have just stayed 5 nights at the maxwell and were very disappointed with it.On the plus side is the location, the service and staff, the restaurant, and the beds all of which are good.On the negative side are noise, maintenance, outdated facilities, tired and shabby looking, and cleanliness. We paid approx US $850 inc taxes for the 5 nights and really felt that this was not good value for money.The rooms at the front and side are incredibly noisey, whilst the rooms at the back are better but still not that quiet. Our 2nd room at the back (room 703) had an adjoining door to the room next door with zero sound reduction. The room safe had no key and the front desk didn,t have a spare. The bathroom is functional but very very old (like '50s)( I dont remember when I last saw an old style wooden toilet seat and cooper louvres for ventilation). The a/c unit (through the window unit) made a noise all night even when switched off. The second room had no bedside unit on one side even though it was a reasonable sized room.Cleanliness is very superficial and we would suggest you dont look under the beds etc. Finally the decor is shabby and the carpets throughout are in drastic need of a good clean.This hotel is not good value for money and is more like a 2 star hotel at 3-4 star prices. It certainly gave us no 'joie de vivre'. This is a pity because it could be made so much better with not a huge capital expenditure. On balance we would not reccommend this hotel at the present prices and could not support its present 3 1/2 star rating.","Oct 17, 2006","4","4",3,3,4,2,5,4,1,"3","$211"

First, the location is great--very quick walk to the BART station, and all the big-time touristy stuff to do in San Francisco. Very convenient.I paid $180 total (including tax, etc) for my one night stay--it was pricey, but I did extensive searching at it was the best rate in the 3 star category I could find for San Francisco. The hotel is tired, and looks like it was renovated perhaps in the late Nineties, so it's not at all dingy but certainly not amazing. Of course, for the price I was paying given the location of the hotel, I wasn't expecting the world, either.I must say the front desk staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, and they had wireless internet acccess in the rooms, which was a big plus. The bed was fine--the coverlet was that gross polyester type thing that probably never gets cleaned, but underneath that were decent sheets and good pillows. The TV was tiny and old, but it didn't bother me much.If you need a decent place to stay at a decent price, the Maxwell Hotel isn't bad.

Well, did we find out on the third night!! The traffic noise on a midweek night/morning is incredible, and we were on the ninth floor! Some double glazing wouldn't go amiss. Deliveries being made, sirens, reversing noises - be warned! Having said that, the location is fabulous, just off union square, so you need to weigh it up I suppose. Also, the room sizes are not huge - we had upgraded to what they called a junior suite but it was pretty much a normal sized room (though it did have a nice sofa) so a normal room might be quite small. Overall, though, we liked this hotel, loads of character and great location(and we didn't think it was run down or shabby at all, as some others have).

Room was very small, dark and the bathroom was tiny. The elevator probably couldn't fit more than 3 people in it with luggage. The man at the front desk was a little full of himself. When we booked at the last minute he told us we were lucky to get a room with such short notice. Then later I overheard him on the phone telling someone he only had 56 bookings that night. Not a way to make me feel welcome. If you like older hotels I could see how you could maybe see it as sort of charming. The parking was just around the corner. The bed was comfortable and the location was good. We stayed at another hotel last year that had just as good location, price.

"hotel_150","hotel_4773","Good location for the price - convenient parking package Overall, the Maxwell Hotel is in a great location in Union Square and the hotel has charm. It's a good deal for the price and is perfect for the budget minded traveler. You will enjoy your stay if: 1) you are looking for something other than a standard hotel chain, 2) don't mind a little wear and tear in your room, and 3) realize that you will hear noise from your room since you are in Union Square - a very busy area of SF! I booked directly through their website and probably could've gotten a cheaper rate if I'd done it more in advance, however less than a week before my stay, I had canceled a reservation for ANOTHER hotel in Union Square that seemed to be getting a lot of negative reviews not only here on TripAdvisor but on other sites as well. I ended up booking the parking package at the Maxwell for a queen executive room for $165 (weekday) which included free parking every day and a welcome bottle of wine. Parking is on Mason St around the corner for $29, so it was convenient to have the parking paid for. By the way, this happens to be on the cheaper end of daily parking rates in Union Square -- as we wandered around we saw a lot of rates at other places for $45 /day. We checked in and went out for dinner; the bottle of wine was waiting for us when we got back, and the hotel staff had also written a personal welcome note on a card accompanying the wine. I only had a few minor complaints about the hotel:1) The definition of executive rooms. The site describes this as one of their large corner rooms, however after we checked in and called the front desk to verify the room type we got (we were not in the corner and the virtual tour of a standard room didn't look very different from our executive room, which looked longer but slightly more narrow), they clarified an executive room as being on the higher floors (we were on the 11th floor out of a total of 12). Also, you apparently will not get a CD player regardless of any room descriptions you read -- their hotel staff told us that none of the rooms have CD players. Not that we needed one, we were just wondering if the room description was accurate.2) We didn't get our toiletry items replenished on the 2nd day (got them for the 1st and 3rd days). Luckily we didn't run out of shampoo in the middle of taking our showers!3) Slightly long wait for help with our luggage on departure (~20 minutes). However the bellman was very friendly and helpful -- I think they just need more staff. I will note here that when we arrived, we were assisted promptly, but there were no other guests waiting in the lobby at the time.Positive points about the Maxwell:* Room was adequate size - not bad in Union Square for the price* Plenty of closet space - actually had two closet areas* Aveda products (just give us a new set every day!)* Free wireless Internet* Bathrobes (provided with the room type we got)* Not like your typical hotel chain, has some character* Restaurant downstairs (Max's) has great food/ambiance and serves breakfast, lunch and dinnerPoints to be aware of:* You will hear music and sirens from your room. We were near the top of the buildling and heard the street noise loud and clear, then realized the window was open. After we shut it, could still hear the sirens from time to time but the music was more muffled. Not enough to bother us though. We lived in NYC for a while and there's a lot more street noise there. You just need to get used to the fact that you're in the middle of a busy urban area!* Like I mentioned before, you need to be OK with a little wear and tear in your room. This is an older hotel - don't expect everything to be in pristine condition. For example, we had some areas of the wall paint in the bathroom chipping away. The hotel should consider doing some remodeling though to address some of these details. I found everything else to be satisfactory -- the furniture, bedding, etc.* Bathroom is small -- but I'm sure this is the same at other boutique hotels in the area, from what I've gathered in other reviews.Overall, considering the cost of the hotel room alone, the experience for us was above average and it would cost us much more to stay right in Union Square at a higher rated hotel. I would consider staying here again, but would definitely try to get an even lower rate!","Sep 11, 2006","3","3",5,5,6,4,5,5,5,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_10051","Good value hotel in a central location. The Maxwell was a homely hotel, in other words a little shabby but welcoming and friendly. Our room was well equipped, clean and comfortable but was starting to look in need of redecoration. The location is perfect for exploring San Francisco being just off Union Square, with regular buses going in all directions. Good Wifi access from the lobby, but reception in our room was poor. Max's Diner on the ground floor was good value with excellent food, although busy at peak times. The only downside to the hotel from our point of view was the noise. Being in a central location, the drunks outside went home at about the same time as the street cleaners and waste collectors started.A tip: the Alamo / National car rental branch near the hotel on Bush is a disgrace.

Finally I noted that I had booked a room with (wow) a coffee maker and cd player - they argued with me about it until I got my confirmation, and only then, about 2 hours later, did they finally give me the room I had paid for. It still stunk. The bed felt like nothing but springs. The bed for my child was a 1950's fold out couch that wouldn't fold back in. it had a paper thin mattress that was permanently (sp?) bent. Bottom line, avoid this one. I know s.f. has old hotels but I think next time i'll stay in a newer one, despite the fact that the rooms might be small. Atleast they should be clean and confortable.

With this package parking was $26.00 per day. Parking at lots by the Maxwell ranged from $40.00 to $45.00 per day. We had a corner junior suite on the eleventh floor. Great views and very comfortable. The room was a little 'tired'. The shower had some paint peeling from a remodel approximately ten years ago and the sofa cushions were a little worn. The room was very clean. The location is great, right next to the St. Francis and a short walk to the cable car. We bought a three day Muni Pass for $18.00 and went all over the city.

This is a old hotel or apartment building. Therefore expect a little noise and some tight spaces. Valet parking is reccomeded and just walk or taxi where you need to go. We had a car from some wine country day trips so we had to park it. If you are just going to the city, take Bart or a cab direclty and save the $30.00 valet parking (thats competitive for SF). The lobby and rooms need some work and my guess if JDV boutght this one a long time ago. The fixtures are outdated and frankly substandard. The tile and paint needs updating. The carpet in the lobby needs replacing. Compared to some of their other properties the room condition was a dissapointment.

"hotel_150","hotel_8866","A great city hotel for a great price This was our first trip to San Francisco and we were not sure what to expect. We had stayed at other urban hotels in New York and D.C. and found them to be very small rooms for very high prices. This was not the case at the Maxwell! We were very pleased with our choice and would certainly stay there again.I booked online and got the self-parking package - so with room, parking, and tax, I think it was under $150 per night, which I thought was very reasonable. Parking was very easy - we were able to pull up to the curb, unload and then take our car to a garage just around the corner. We could come and go as we pleased with our car - the hotel just validated the parking ticket each time we left.The hotel is in an older building with a lot of charm, but is well maintained and tastefully decorated. We ate in the restaraunt the first night we were there and it was great - lots of choices for tired and hungry travellers.The best part of the the Maxwell was our room - corner room on the 8th floor. It was like a small apartment with a hallway leading to a really big bathroom and then a bedroom with small desk/sitting area and a sink/mini bar. The room was decorated really nicely - no cheesey hotel art. The bed had a partial canopy and the bedding was very attractive, clean, and comfortable. The best part about the place was the large arched windows (2 in the bedroom and one in the bathroom). We had great city views of the streets and the theater just below. The hallway closet had everything we could need - iron, luggage rack, extra bedding, and bathrobes!The staff was helpful, the lobby was comfortable. I have very little negative comments to make. The only thing I can think of was that the bathroom was somewhat old. It had charm that I can appreciate being interested in historic buildings/interiors, but I can see where that could detract from someone's experience. Mostly the bathtub - peeling finishes and some mold in the tub caulking. We had a problem with our toilet backing up and not flushing, but that was dealt with by the hotel with no problem.The location is great - right near Union Square and cable car stops so you can get anywhere you need to go. The panhandlers and homeless people were a big distraction in walking around the immediate hotel area. They are very bold and will come right up to you to give you directions, recommendations, or a publication and then ask for money. That was not so great, but we just stuck to the more touristy areas and didn't have a big problem once we figured that out.All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel!","Aug 11, 2006","2","2",6,5,5,4,5,5,4,"3","$211"

My only two complaints (which are nothing) is that the ice machine is located on the 2nd floor and it can be kind of a pain in the rump to run down a couple of times a day, and the water pressure in the shower is likened to being spit on. (darn those water conservation efforts, ha!) All in all our stay was fabulous and I'd recommend the Maxwell to anyone.","May 23, 2006","10","9",5,5,1,5,1,5,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_10008","Very pleased Just got back from a conference in San Francisco which was held @ a major chain hotel w/in steps of the Maxwell (hint, hint), but I elected to stay @ the Maxwell for 2 reasons:1. Nearly $100 less/night than the conference hotel room rate2. Free internet (conference hotel was charging $15/night!!)All in all, having seen the rooms of friends who DID stay @ the conference hotel, I'm very pleased w/my choice of the Maxwell. Unlike my friends rooms, mine did not smell of smoke, mold, or mildew, the internet connection in the room worked like a charm,  even though my room @ the Maxwell was smack next to the elevator, I never heard it or anyone in the room next to me thru the walls; my friends didn't have the same luck @ the conference hotel! I think, overall, my room was bigger than my friends, albeit a bit dark (like the friends rooms next door, my room faced out to a brick wall  could have used higher wattage bulbs in the various lamps) though the bathroom was quite small, but the towels were plenty big  fluffy  when the hair dryer in my room died one morning, an engineer was knocking on the door w/a replacement almost as soon as I hung up the phone. As someone who likes lots of ice in her drinks, it was a bit annoying to have to keep trekking down to the mezzanine to the lone ice machine, but that's honestly the extent of my 'complaints'. If I ever HAVE to go back to San Francisco (don't like the city itself, so it would take quite a bit to get me back there), I would have no problem staying @ the Maxwell again.","May 4, 2006","4","4",6,4,1,4,1,4,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_1770","Good Central Hotel The Maxwell is the sort of 'traditional' hotel I would expect to see in the middle of the city - as you see in the films. As others say, a little worn, but sort of atmospheric, unlike a new place or a boutique hotel/motel. The room was on the small side, but comfortable and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is great. No tea/coffee in the rooms, but 2 or 3 24hr diners over the road. A new air con/heater in the single glazed window. Quite a bit of street noise, (3rd floor) but then this is the centre of SF.","Apr 22, 2006","3","3",5,4,1,5,1,5,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_6308","great location, good value Three of us shared a junior suite for a conference. The bathroon was nice, except for a cracked resurfacing attempt. Beds, including the rollaway, were comfy. The bedroom had an extra vanity that made early-morning prep easier. The neighborhood seemed safe and it was convenient to the convention center.

It is an old hotel, so the rooms are small, elevators a bit slow, but I thought it was fine for the girls getaway. Area felt safe and walking distance to the Union Square shopping and nightlife. The bar / restaurant - we walked out because the bartender spent more time chatting it up with coworkers rather than take our order - too bad as we like to drink:)","Apr 3, 2006","1","1",5,4,1,5,1,5,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_5997","Pretty good hotel and location for the price The Maxwell is a very cute hotel in a good location. There is nothing fancy about the hotel. We stayed in about the cheapest room they had, and it was nice - small, but nice. There's so much to do in San Francisco, though, that we didn't spend much time in the room, so it didn't bother us that the room was small (it is a boutique hotel, and my experience is that boutique hotel rooms tend to be smaller). It was good enough for sleep. The queen size bed was comfortable. Everything was clean. The toiletries (shampoos, lotions, etc.) were better than average. The staff was friendly - they gave us directions and helped us book our wine country tour. We liked the diner on the corner and the corner diner across the street (their omlets were AWESOME!). The hotel is close to casual restaurants and bars and within walking distance (well, what I call walking distance anyway - several blocks) from Union Square, great shopping and the cable car turn around. If I didn't have friends that live in San Francisco and won't let us stay anywhere but their place now, I'd stay at the Maxwell again.

"hotel_150","hotel_4417","Very nice boutique hotel ! I was worried after reading some reviews but the Maxwell is really nice. I would definately stay here again. It's a boutique hotel so it's not going to be huge or ultra modern. Instead, it's quaint and very comfortable. The room was smallish but plenty big for 2 people sharing a 2 doublebed room for 2 days. The room is pretty and well furnished. The carpets and bathroom were very clean and the furnishings were well kept. There wasn't a lot of extra space so we used the desk and chairs for piling things on top of rather than as proper desk and chairs. The bathroom was very small but the shower had plenty of pressure and hot water. The morning coffee is in the lobby and was pretty good. There wouldn't have been enough space in the room for a mini coffee maker so that worked just fine for us. The location is perfect for Union Square, Moscone center, Chinatown, etc. You can walk anywhere nearby and a cab ride is cheap to the airport. My only complaint was that the valet parking didn't have my car when needed and we were in a rush to get to the airport. The desk staff kept calling and asking for it but it's a hassle when they don't run the valet--it seems to be an outside company. Self parking is a 1/2 block away and cheaper than valet.","Mar 12, 2006","0","0",5,5,1,5,1,5,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_3543","Not bad but small rooms and a little dated Our first impression of the Maxwell was that the hotel doesn't really live up to its website. The decor, although attempting to be art deco (I think) just seems a little dated. Our room was not large, especially for a family of 4, and the bathroom was tiny.However, it was clean, the location was great, the staff were helpful, and the restaurant attached (Max's) was wonderful - good food and not expensive with attentive serving staff.","Mar 8, 2006","0","0",4,3,1,5,1,5,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_4101","Do not stay here its terrible Hated this hotel- their website makes it look really nice but when you arrive it is grotty and smelly. We had to change room 3 times and we had booked a family room with 2 adults, 2 children and we ended up in a room with 3 of us in 1 double bed. We had no coffee maker in the room and when I queried this at reception was told that guests steal stuff from the room all the time and the hotel can't afford to replace them. Bathroom so small that the door skimmed along the toilet when you opened it and you had hardly enough room to sit down. Air conditioning unit attached over the window so you had no daylight and it was extremely noisy all night.Didn't sleep under the blankets as the bed was dirty and the room really cold and heating not working properly. Felt quite unsafe as hobos hanging around the entrance shouting abuse at us everytime we left the hotel. This was quite expensive for what you got as the standard was terrible - a youth hostel would have been better!!!

"hotel_150","hotel_9720","Clean, but cramped We stayed at the Maxwell Hotel, near Union Square in San Francisco. It was an older hotel that was clean, but well worn. We stayed in a double double room which was the smallest type of room they had and it certainly was small! Our family is on the petite side, but even for us, it was cramped! I could not imagine how an averge size person could get into their bathroom, because of the design. In order to get into the bathroom, you had to squeeze between the door and the sink/counter, while trying to not fall into the toilet in order to get the door closed! The sleeping area itself was not very spacious, either. The Heater/AC unit was a little noisy, too. Fortuanely the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. It was quiet up on the 7th floor and conveinient to Union Square and Chinatown. Self parking was 1/2 a block down the street. The Maxwell Hotel was comparable to other older hotels near Union Square, in size and decorum. If it were the cheapest price in the area, we would stay again for 1 night. But if I were a planning a longer stay, I would look for something more comfortable.","Feb 13, 2006","4","4",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$211"

The staff were frienly and helpfull. we were there just before christmas and even the christmas decorations were great.

It was on the corner of the top floor(1204). If you go to their website it looks just like it is presented. The staff is what makes it a 5 star. Micheal at the front desk was helpful with the room, directions and city information. The bellman and the entire staff welcomed the Country Mouse to the City. The bathroom was clean and has a old iron tub. It was deep and plenty long for long legs. A seperate dressing area, bath robes and a safe. It was a large room with great art. The best was the LOCATION. You could not ask for a better one. You can walk everywhere. Catch the bus, trolley or a cab. Restaurants are abundant all around with all flavors of the world. Shopping from Saks to Macy's steps away. You can not beat this price and location in Union Square.  Free coffee in the morning to get you started. A nice touch.

"hotel_150","hotel_2586","A Great Stay After I booked a few nights on Priceline, I came to this site and was a bit terrified by some of the reviews here. But my stay was perfectly pleasant. The room was sufficiently large, clean, and plenty quiet. Housekeeping kept leaving a friendly letter from the management warning of noise from some exterior renovation work after 9am, but I never actually heard any of it.Negatives? My room was a bit dark and didn't have much of a view. (It faced the ventilation shaft, not the street.) Some of the mouldings and architectural details were a bit worn around the edges, but this didn't bother me. The heater smelled a bit when I first turned it on, but I was fine without it.The staff were friendly and professional, though I didn't really interact with them at all aside from check-in and check-out. I called ahead of my visit and they booked me in a non-smoking room with no fuss at all.As mentioned elsewhere, the location is quite accessible to the BART and various MUNI lines. I walked to Chinatown my first morning in town. I did not try the restaurant attached to the lobby (it looked a bit pricey for me) but I did find an excellent little Thai place on Powell a block-and-a-half from the hotel, near the HM. Fast, cheap, and deelicious!My room also had complementary Internet access. If you bring a laptop, you can connect to their high-speed ethernet network for no additional fee.One lovely and unexpected bonus: the morning's complementary coffee in the lobby was surprisingly tasty. I'd say even better than some of the premium shops around town!","Nov 28, 2005","3","3",5,5,1,5,1,5,1,"3","$211"

My advice is to take them with a pinch of salt. The hotel is in a perfect location for San Francisco, in fact we walked everywhere during our 3 days there. The rooms are fine in size (bathrooms a little on the small side) and the staff are all polite. Yes, the hotel isn't stunning and have lots of facilities but for the price its exactly what you need. If you go to San Francisco you don't spend much time in your hotel so to go for a more expensive one would be a waste.We ate in Max's downstairs which was fine - huge portions, slightly above average on price but great when you've got jet lag and want something quick.","Nov 24, 2005","3","3",5,4,1,4,1,5,1,"3","$211"

Don't expect Hilton or Westin comfort. The bed was uncomfortably hard (...and I really do like a firm bed). The walls are thin so you can hear everything from rooms above, below and adjacent to you.For a great breakfast, walk 5 minutes to Dottie's on Jones St. EXCELLENT food with a 45 minute wait to get a table.","Nov 16, 2005","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$211"

Ate at the restaurant next door, but was not inmpressed. The best breakfast we had on our 2 weeks travelling holiday in calafornia was at 'dotties' about a 5 min walk from the hotel. Take a right out of the hotel and up a few blocks and then left. Dooties is not in a very nice area, but the food is amazing, queues for a table start about 7.15am so get there early and they close at 12pm. They served the best pancakes/bacon/grittes I have every had. A most is also to go to the cheesecake factory at the top of Maceys, we got some to take out as there is a long wait for a table.

We booked the room through Expedia well in advance and had read several of the reviews posted on this site and others. Needless to say we were extremely curious as to the result. On first impressions, the outside of the hotel looked better on the web though. Our room on the fifth floor, although quite small was clean, had air conditioning and was sufficiently buffered against the onslaught of noise that emanates from Geary and Mason Street. The bathroom (shower/tub) was clean. Our safe worked. The room did not smell stale. The Maxwell staff we found were courteous and provided assistance when requested. Some nice touches were bottled water at the front desk, courtesy coffee in lobby in the morning and a copy of the newspaper. We did not eat in the restaurant. There were a number of breakfast places near by that we tried- Pinecrest, David's Deli, Lefty O'Douls and Lori's Diner.

It seemed like some of the opinions were wildly different - so I lowered my expectations in anticipation and ....I was very pleased.We booked a Jr. Suite which gives a larger than average room size (we had a queen bed and a pull-out sofa for the 5-year old). There was quite a large closet too (shoot we coulda had the kid sleep there!).We were on the 11th floor and on the backside - so we had no noise issues that many of the negative posts cited. On one night we could hear a neighbor's tv for a period so I suppose that could have been a problem - but it was not.Rooms were very clean. I found the decor nice - not boring washed-out Holiday Inn style. I liked the art (not as snobbish as some other rather catty postings). Reminded me of hotels I've stayed in Europe.Front desk was very friendly (always greeted my daughter by name). They have a few board games you can take to the rooms. We booked a Kids are VIP package and upon check-in our daughter received a bag containing: Small stuffed bear, small coloring book, bubbles.Location is terrific.Max's was quite nice (daughter got a free meal with our Kids are VIP package).

Location wise, it couldn't be better for exploring SF and all the shops (of course) - one block away from Union Square. It is designed to look Art Deco, maybe not to all tastes but we didn't mind.On the night we arrived exhausted from a trans-Atlantic flight, we had to change room as the window didn't close properly and apart from a very chilly draught (it was March) the noise from the street was something else for the 11th floor - cars, shouting and singing (outside of the theatres across the street). They changed our room (after two telephone calls, we were forgot about the first time, on a not-so-busy Sunday night...) but there was still that noise, though not anywhere as bad with a working window! I suppose it is the nature of a city centre anywhere, and it wasn't really a huge deal but double glazing would have helped the noise situation as it certainly took a bit of getting used to. We stayed room only, so only visited the restaurant below (Max's) a couple of times. Food was good and not badly priced. For breakfast we went to Lefty O'Dowd's or Lori's nearby - very cheap and you were set up nicely for the long day ahead!Room and bathroom were cleaned everyday, staff were polite (despite the first night hiccup) so no problems there.Overall - not bad but there is probably better in SF.","Feb 24, 2005","5","5",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$211"
"hotel_150","hotel_9037","Great Location, Good Value Despite having seen a few negative reviews on this site my family stayed at the Maxwell in December. There was some early confusion about the availability of the room we had booked but we were given the option of taking a larger room at the same price. We thankfully accepted and were very happy with the size and quality of the room. The bathroom is quite small and the whole room could do with a bit of a makeover, but all in all it was clean, quiet and suitable.The hotel is wonderfully situated, a short walk from Union Square. We did not use the Hotel's restaurant as there are several reasonably priced and good quality diners nearby (eg Lori's, Pinecrest) but beware of the beggars everywhere. I've never seen so many beggars as frequent this part of San Francisco.My only complaint about the hotel is a relatively minor one. I allowed myself to be pressured by the bellhop into taking a limo' that was waiting out the front to the airport and ended up paying a lot more than a cab would have cost.

"hotel_150","hotel_1360","A Week at the Maxwell Hotel Just returned from a ten day trip to the San Francisco Bay area. We spent six nights at the Maxwell in the heart of Union Square. At check in we asked for a quiet room. They had already bumped us up to a junior suite due to our longer than usual stay. The suite was very large ( app. 400 square feet) and quiet considering the hustle and bustle of the area. The suite had three distinct areas: bedroom, sitting room and study in one large suite. Of course there was a private bath with a skinny soaking tub and an industrial strength fast flush toilet. These were some of the other amenities: Bedroom- queen bed, vanity with wet sink and bedside tables with reading lamps. Sitting area- queen sleep sofa , two somewhat comfy chairs, coffee table and a TV. The  study was a desk with overhead lighting as well as a lamp. One window overlooked downtown and the Bay in the distance. Other two windows had no view. Most of the noise was background ..the whoosh of traffic ...lots of mechanized noises. Since I like to sleep with no noise at all, I bought ear plugs at a local travel store on Market Street and used them each night. My husband slept fine without them. I have stayed in many more elegant hotels for alot more money. Because of the size of the room and relative quiet, we thought we got an excellent deal. I booked on an internet site and the charge was $115.00 per night (minus tax) You are definately near everything when you stay here. It was good to have a restaurant downstairs, and their atmosphere is pleasant. However, for the same price, I prefer to recommend the breakfast and lunch food and the fast, friendly service at the 24 hour Pinecrest diner diagonally across the street. The atmosphere is very basic, but we got in and out quickly and the food was much better than Max's. Save your time for a more elegant meal in a swank place. All in all the Maxwell was a great deal.","Jul 8, 2004","4","2",5,5,1,4,1,4,1,"3","$211"

As stated by other posted guests, the hotel is at a great location at Union Square, close to cable car stop and China Town. On the negative side, the room was small for me, wife and two pre-teen daughters. The beds were hard and uncomfortable.

"hotel_163","hotel_8599","Okay for the price I found this motel via the internet-it was our third trip to SF and we decided to try something different than our first stay, which was in the financial district (second visit was a one day trip). The website was very well written and the photos were very enchanting. We were a bit disappointed upon our arrival. Not having much knowledge of the area, we did not realize the motel is right on a main thoroughfare; very busy with traffic. The pictures on the website and the customer reviews create this image of a motel nestled in a quiet corner of the Marina district, but this is not true. The room was quite small but okay for the two of us. We were right next to a room which allowed pets and the walls were very thin, so we heard the dogs barking for 5 hours straight one night because they left them unattended in their room. We almost called management but it was our last night, so we didn't make a big deal about it. Also, we could hear the neighbors coming in and out each and every time. The room was clean but they had a very old style heater in the room and it only heated the top half of the room. So, when we were on the bed watching tv, we would be cold but when we stood up, it would be toasty warm. It was okay for the duration of our visit and for the price, well, we got what we paid for, in our opinion. The website and the pictures are in a way, deceiving because there are no cobblestones in the courtyard and it wasn't really a quiet stay. I think if they included a picture of their neon lit sign, which is conveniently left out of the pictures on the website, people wouldn't be so quick to fall in love with the place; sight unseen.","Dec 7, 2008","0","0",3,3,3,4,6,6,4,"3.5","$119"
"hotel_163","hotel_7083","Quaint and charming I reserved 3 rooms in this sweet little motel on Lombard Street for my family. Each room was clean, no smells, and well equipped with the usual necessities. My room faced the street and was indeed noisy and shook with the big trucks but this did not bother me at all. It was just part of the city. The other rooms were interior courtyard rooms and were very quiet. There are window boxes full of colorful flowers and there is a little interior hallway  The staff was very friendly and helpful both in booking months ahead and while we were there. Talk to them about the room noise if that is a problem for anyone in your party.  This motel is in the Marina district which proved to be perfect. It is only a short walk to all kinds of restaurants and shopping. We also walked down to the Chrissy Fields Beach one morning. We easily caught the bus to go down to the wharf and another day up to Golden Gate Park. Easy to go anywhere on the buses and trolleys from this motel. There is free, free, free covered parking as a big bonus and the room rates was exceptionally low.","Nov 17, 2008","0","0",6,5,6,5,6,4,4,"3.5","$119"
"hotel_163","hotel_9374","Great Location for a Quaint Hotel The last few reviews are fairly accurate. We had a Lombard-side room which was fairly noisy. Lombard is a major throroughfare, so there is traffic at most hours of the night, with just a small decrease in the wee hours. Had we know, I certainly would have requested an inner courtyard or east side room. Also, the DVD player on our TV had tape over it, which seemed a bit tacky.That said, it is a sweet place in a great location. The room was comfortable and well-maintained. The same family has owned/managed the hotel since it was build in 1939, which says a lot. You can see they put some care into the maintenance (they were painting garden scenes on the walls during our stay). There's lots of stuff within walking distance (Presidio, Chestnut St., etc.) or bus line (Alcatraz trip, Embarcadero). And the price is quite reasonable for SF. We would definitely stay again assuming we could move the room.","Sep 1, 2008","0","0",6,4,6,5,5,5,5,"3.5","$119"

We took sleeping pills to help us get an hour or two of rest, but still found it difficult. We tried to change our room, but the Motel was fully booked, so we decided it was easier to stay for our remaining three nights than to pack up and try again.

"hotel_163","hotel_5706","Good value-not perfect My mom and I stayed at the Marina Motel recently. I brought my small dog along too and we stayed for 3 nights. Overall, this was a good place to stay, despite a few flaws. It seems there are trade-offs with every place, so this was no exception. The Chestnut St. neighborhood has a lot of good restaurants and shops (including a couple of pet-related shops and Peets Coffee), and we liked the proximity to the Palace of FIne Arts, Crissy Field and the Presidio. It's close to the Golden Gate Bridge. The motel is also within walking distance to a neighborhood called Cow Hollow. So, the location is one of the best things about the motel. We liked the fact that we could park underneath our unit (most of the time), and the motel setting is very pretty with lots of bouganvillia, fuschia, etc. Cheerful. A real plus is that they allow pets and don't charge you an arm and a leg to stay there. The rooms weren't perfect - the windows had a mind of their own and the radiator was unpredictable and noisy. The door could use weather stripping. It was really nice that there were windows on both sides of the room. The beds were okay - we had 2 full size beds and one of them seemed newer because it was quite a bit firmer than the other one. The room was pretty clean and the staff friendly. One corner of the carpet smelled a bit like pet urine. The bathroom had a window which was nice and the shower was roomy and everything worked well. You aren't supposed to leave your pet in the room alone, which we obeyed, but our neighbors left their dog in their room alone and it barked often. The TV was a modern flat screen. Would I recommend this place? Yes, definitely, despite a few minor flaws.","Aug 23, 2008","0","0",5,4,5,5,4,5,5,"3.5","$119"
"hotel_163","hotel_9099","Not the Ritz, but a decent place to stay We found the place thru Frommers and it has already been mentioned that this place is not the Ritz. We got a family room. Which is 2 rooms and a bathroom. The front room is facing Lombard, so it is very loud, but our kids sleep like bricks, so they were fine. The back room was alittle quieter, so that worked better for us. If noise is a problem for you, I would not recommend the rooms that are up along Lombard. Ask for the rooms on the back side of the motel. But this worked fine for us and the fridge and microwave were useful.The rooms were both very dated and tiny. There is barely a foot of walking room around the beds. The bathroom is actually spacious in comparison even though very dated.The rooms are kept clean and the maid was always done with the rooms before we came back around lunchtime. There are so many great places to eat on Chestnut street, this was a great location. Alot of sights are within walking distance if you don't mind hiking it. But there are bus stops all over the place and you can get anywhere if you hop on the right bus. It did take a bit to figure out the right bus though, so I suggest you look at the routes online before your trip, or use their free wi-fi when you get to the motel. Or I imagine you can pick up a bus schedule somewhere. Bus 39 on Chestnut went everywhere though: Fisherman's wharf, Little Italy, China Town, Financial district. Or ask for a transfer when you board the bus. Also, the bus drivers were all very friendly if you need help.Overall, the price was nice compared to other places in the area and the free parking would make it a steal if you have a car (we just walked everywhere though).Take advantage of the BOGO breakfast coupon from the lobby. The prices were high, but if you're buying just 2 dishes, then the free one makes up for the overpriced first dish. But be ready, everything in San Fran is expensive, so this is not a bad deal at all. Also, check the times on the coupon before you go. I think Sundays had a time restriction.","Aug 10, 2008","0","0",5,3,6,4,5,5,5,"3.5","$119"
"hotel_163","hotel_1054","Sleep tight...but be careful in room 28 We are frequent travelers who look for the best value for the money- the Marina Motel seemed to fit all of our requirements- reasonable price, good location, parking included, kitchenette, free wi-fi. With three people in the party we tried to book a room with two double beds, but they were already booked, so we had a double with a rollaway cot- ROOM 28. It was a very small room, but adequate and on the inner courtyard to reduce the noise from Lombard Street. The location is around the corner from Chestnut Street which has good restaurants, a market for groceries, and a stop for the bus to go downtown. All in all we liked it except:After a couple of days, we discovered some strange bugs on the walls and bed-we did an internet search and also took a couple of them to Heidi, the manager, who confirmed that they were indeed bedbugs. She was very proactive and called Terminex immediately, but they could not come until the next day- in the interim the staff vacuumed and cleaned the room thoroughly. Being a summer weekend in San Francisco, with most hotels filled, we did not have many options other than giving them a chance to try to eliminate the problem. However, when we returned to the room after Terminex had been there and steam cleaned, there were still bugs in the room, and the rollaway was too wet to sleep on, either from the steam cleaning or something being spilled on it. The night clerk was less than helpful, seemed to be a surfer dude/space cadet- he did not want to contact Heidi and told us we could bite the bullet and stay, or find another hotel ( not easy at midnite on Saturday). He did make a few calls to hotels, then said he couldn't help us anymore because he had paperwork to do. When he was finally convinced to call Heidi, she was of course very upset that we still had a problem.  We were able to make reservations elsewhere for the remainder of our stay, but one of our party came home covered with terrible bites, requiring a day off from work for a doctor's visit and steroid prescriptions to alleviate the inflamation and itching. Overall, there were a lot of things to recommend this motel, but under the circumstances it was a disastrous stay, and knowing what we do now, we would have moved out immediately upon finding the first evidence of bedbugs.  We know that this can happen at any hotel and we thought Heidi was very friendly, responsive, concerned and cooperative, but we heard from one desk clerk that this had been a problem in this room before- if that is true, they need to be more agressive in their monitoring of the rooms. Also, a certain desk clerk needs to be a little less laid back and more customer friendly.","Aug 3, 2008","0","0",3,3,4,3,3,3,4,"3.5","$119"

There are many good restaurants, coffee shops, and other neighborhood commercial establishments nearby, especially along Chestnut Street behind the motel. Although the rooms are small by today's standards, keep in mind that the Marina Motel is a motel of the late 1930s in style and layout, which owners have taken care to respect while modernizing in other ways for visitor convenience and comfort. Although not within walking distance to SF downtown (Union Square area), it's easy to get there by public transportation or driving your own car. Likewise any other SF neighborhood of interest.

That's no small deal because a typical hotel will charge $20 - $30 per night for parking in San Francisco. If you are looking for a Holiday-Inn-style place this is probably not your motel. This is a 1930's vintage motel and that's part of its charm. All the bathrooms have been modernized, and the staff keeps the place very clean. If you can get one of the rooms with a kitchen, it will really help you keep your expenses down by eating a few meals in your room. There are a bunch of great restaurants at various price levels within walking distance of the motel. The staff at the motel are really friendly and extremely helpful.

It's old, and bit worn, and the rooms tend to be a bit cramped, but it's clean, comfortable, and well-kept. It dates back to the construction of the Golden Gate bridge. There's a lot to like. The location is close to many really good restaurants along Chestnut Street, and it's an easy (and safe) walk down to the bay, where one finds the well-known Greens restaurant with its great view of the Golden Gate. All the rooms are on the 2nd floor, with small parking garages underneath, perfect for a rental car. It's on Lombard Street, with regular bus service, and is surprisingly easy to get in and out of. A 24 hour Walgreens is in the same block. The rooms vary, but each of the rooms we've stayed in have had a beautifully tiled shower stall, refrigerator, and closet,. The facility is arranged in a large square with an inner courtyard that includes a building with additional rooms and is ringed with a spectacular array of flowering plants. The Marina is not a 5-star accommodation, lacking things like a lounge and similar amenities, but on the other hand, the value can't be argued with and its other advantages put it up there with far more expensive places. Besides, in SF, you want to be out and about, not hanging around in your accommodations.

The facility was built as a motor inn in 1939 with garages at ground level and the rooms over them in a Mediterranean style, which is now attractively draped in colorful climbing bougainvillea. The Marina is a charming place to stay and has a great atmosphere. It is somewhat funky and a bit frayed around the edges. The motel was last redecorated in the '80's and the age of the re-do is definitely beginning to show. The rooms, however, unlike so many S.F. hotels, are of good size and many have windows on two sides. There is no a/c. Many rooms, the ones really worth having, have kitchenettes. Lombard St. is really noisy, so the best rooms are those on the north side of the facility, well away from it. We stayed in two rooms on the west side of the motel, well in from Lombard, but still fairly noisy. Bus lines into Union Square are conveniently nearby on Chestnut St. There are a nice array of very good neighborhood spots on Chestnut in which to eat.Altogether we very much enjoyed our stay at the Marina.","Jun 1, 2007","1","1",5,5,5,6,5,6,4,"3.5","$119"
"hotel_163","hotel_2964","Well located boutique hotel This hotel was recommended by another boutique motel that was full for the nights we wanted to stay. They recommended Marina Motel because of its safe location -- I was originally looking to stay around Union Square. I was SO glad to have listened and stayed outside the busiest area of SF -- this hotel provided breathing space, but was very well connected to the city. The bus line is just a block away and runs all hours - the most we ever waited was 5 minutes, both by the hotel and in the city, for a bus...and it also runs to all of the great sights in SF. The hotel was well accomodating and the staff very friendly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a no-frills, conveniently located boutique hotel in SF.","May 22, 2007","1","1",6,4,6,6,5,5,6,"3.5","$119"

Mirror was on the left side of the sink and you had to stand between the toilet and the wall to see in it. There was steam heat and I froze until the middle of the night then it got really warm. Hard to control! Left the next morning and found a much nicer place two blocks down that was less expensive and welcomed my pet with no additional charge. Marina allows pets but made me sign a paper saying if I left them alone in the room they could call a pet sitter and charge me.

"hotel_163","hotel_2106","Interesting Hotel The hotel is in a very busy area of San Francisco and the directions from the hotel website were not correct. The hotel was quaint and had a cute atmosphere but the rooms were quiet small and you can hear everything your neighbors say or do. The area is convenient to buses and taxis to travel to the tourist areas. They allowed our 2 animals to stay in our rooms and the units have a small garage beneath them for your vehicle. There is no air conditioner and we left the windows open at night for air circulation which was not a great thing to do. You can hear everything from your hotel room.A positive aspect of our trip was the night manager who was of a great help in assisting us with our directions out of town and any questions we had.","Feb 13, 2007","5","4",4,3,4,4,3,4,1,"3.5","$119"

The staff was friendly, the rooms were small but very clean. Each room has its own garage, though we did not drive. It is conveniently located in the marina district and the buses run right in front of the motel. There are great restaurants nearby, Judys Cafe was our fave! All of the sights are not in walking distance, but the public transporation is nearby. The Exploratorium is few blocks away and sells a CityPass for transportation. The Golden Gate Bridge is almost in eyeshot of the motel. The wharf area is also very close. We did a lot of walking and felt like we were locals. The motel is right near homes so you are not surrounded by other tourists. I would recommend anyone to stay here. They allow pets in some rooms. We did not see any fleas or anything of that nature so DO NOT let this sway you towards another hotel. I stayed in the financial district at the Plaza my first time for business.

The staff including house keeping is very friendly and helpfull.I just love the neighborhood, shopping and Presidio close by. The rooms could be a little cleaner, but it is acceptable.

"hotel_163","hotel_7440","Interesting place I wasn't sure how to classify this place. I also was undecided whether to give it an average rating or above average. I guess it depends what you compare it to. I gave it an above average rating because it felt comfortable. I know some of the botique hotels in SF are a bit nicer with nicer touches but this place is a little different.We booked two rooms at the Marina Courtyard Motel. One was $132 for two doubles and the other was $125 for a queen. From the street side on Lombard Street it would be easy to drive by and miss it. But once you turn inside the small driveway you feel like you are in a different setting. Beautiful hanging flowers surround the place giving it an almost surreal setting. You can hear the traffic on Lombard. We have an inside room and whether you have the windows open or shut there is a good chance you will hear the traffic. The rooms are clean and the staff friendly. THe bathroom was clean. Furniture was adequate. Being above ground level you can open all the windows in the room for fresh air. The area is safe and I was able to take a run down to the marina. Anywhere behind the hotel takes you towards the marina. The location is just minutes from the Golden Gate Bridge and the Presidio. Chestnut street is a block over and hosts neat shops and dining establishments. We ate breakfast at Ella's serving the best pancakes around. We also went to a pizza place called Little Star on Divisadero which serves some of the best pizza anywhere. Both places are frequented by the locals. Both places require you to drive.Overall, if you want a true hotel then this might not be the place for you. But if you want something a little different then I would recommend you try this place. I took my family here and would do it again.","Jul 31, 2006","7","7",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3.5","$119"

I wandered the streets of the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhood, admiring the architecture and making it down to the water for a lovely view of Golden Gate bridge. Many restaurants and great shopping are within close proximity. Best of all, even though it's tight, parking is included.I'd definitely recommend this lodging for the traveler on a budget who's looking for an active vacation in the middle of a bustling city.","Feb 21, 2006","4","4",5,4,1,5,1,4,1,"3.5","$119"
"hotel_163","hotel_4963","Good Value in the Marina District We chose the Marina Motel in the Marina District as home base for our first trip to SF. Great location, friendly staff, quirky/charming surroundings, clean rooms, and a good value. From the motel, it's an easy walk to the bay, past lovely art deco styled Marina District homes. From the bay, walk to the right for Ghirardelli Square and Fisherman's wharf and cablecars to downtown; walk to the left for the beach and the Exploratorium and the Golden Gate Bridge. The motel is just one block from Chestnut Street restaurants, bakeries, shops and an old-fashioned movie theatre...very much a neighborhood feel (vs. the touristy Wharf area or the frantic downtown area).

"hotel_163","hotel_1602","great place We just stayed at the Marina Motel for 4 nights and had an exellent time. We were in rooms 20 and 21 which share a bathroom so it is great for a family or 2 couples. The rooms are a bit small but nicely decorated. Our rooms were in the back corner of the courtyard so they were very quiet. There is enough parking for everybody, it is a tight squeeze at times but really you just want to park once and use the bus when going into town. There is a busstop on Lombard not even a block away but forget about that one, walk one block down to Chestnut and take the number 30 bus into town. It will just about get you anywhere. We did get the coupon for the 2 for 1 breakfast but decided that Judy's was a bit expensive especially when across the street from the hotel (on Divisadero/Lombard) you can have breakfast for about 4 dollars. They aren't very fast but the food was good. There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well so when you don't want to eat in town you can always get something near the hotel. All in all it was a perfect city hotel. You can get to the sightseeing points quickly and easily and there are enough amenities near the hotel (a 24 hr wallgreens for example) as well.","May 27, 2005","6","6",6,5,1,6,1,5,1,"3.5","$119"

"hotel_163","hotel_7983","Charming and Friendly We felt like we were staying in a small European Inn with a quiet back courtyard and beautiful wall murals decorating the outside of the Spanish style buildings. Although we were just around the corner from some great people watching at the numerous sidewalk cafes, restaurants and cute little boutiques on Chestnut Street, we were also only five minutes away from Fishermans Wharf. Each room comes with a garage so we took the advice of the front desk person and hopped on the bus for $1.25 to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square. The people at the front desk were very helpful and recommended really good local places to eat and the owners golden retriever, Calvin, makes the place feel more like home. The rooms were on the small side but all the flowers in the courtyard made up for it. We were told that the original owner's grandaughters run the place now but he built the motel in the late 1930's for the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge (2 min away by car). The motel was in a really good neighborhood and we walked on the beach to the Golden Gate Bridge and another day to Fisherman's Wharf and took the bus back. Next time we return we want to get a room with a kitchen and we might even bring our dog since a few of the rooms are pet-friendly.","Nov 5, 2004","5","5",6,5,1,6,1,6,1,"3.5","$119"

"hotel_163","hotel_3030","If you're driving to (or renting a car in) San Francisco... I travel to SF often , and I always stay in a different place and then put my review on this useful website when i return.My most recent stay--at The Marina Courtyard Motel--was excellent. I discovered the place here, but booked my room directly through their website.I paid 89 dollars a night. The motel is located on Lombard Street in the Marina district---this is the long wide busy street full of hotels and motels that leads to and from the Golden Gate Bridge. In fact, the Marina motel was built to celebrate the opening of the bridge, and it does have a unique early 20th century charm, with its Spanish details and courtyard filled with flowers. Ask for a room facing into the courtyard, so you won't be bothered as much by Lombard traffic, though the Marina is at the quieter end of Lombard, close to the park and bridge entrance. The motel is literally two blocks from the entrance to the famous Presido. I jogged every morning there and the big shady forested paths were idyllic. The motel gave us a 2 for 1 breakfast voucher for a really good and popular joint on Chestnut street: an upscale, bustling shopping area right around the corner from the motel.We had an extra car since my friend met me there, and they let us have 2 private enclosed garages for our vehicles for no charge. Try finding that ANYWHERE else in SF. If you drive to SF, this is the deal. The rooms were small but not tiny, and were clean and cozy with nice windows that open into the courtyard. The only thing I will complain about is a personal pet peeve: the use of flourescent light bulbs, which you find here and almost everywhere; they give everything a sickening glow. SO, walk 50 feet from the hotel to the convenient 24 hour Walgreen's Drugstore and spend a dollar or two for your own incandescent bulbs to screw into the lamps and you'll be set (unless u like looking sickly). This is a great find. The staff were super helpful, friendly and accomodating. I will stay here everytime i drive to SF. Note: not all rooms have bathtubs, so ask.","Jul 29, 2004","6","6",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3.5","$119"

"hotel_172","hotel_2029","Greatest Location on the Island!!! I was born on Oahu and know the Islands quite well. When a great deal came available, which included this hotel, we jumped on it! Positive things first: the hotel is in absolutely the best location in Waikiki. It is right on Kalakaua Avenue and looks directly onto the beach and the ocean, with no obstructions. We walked everywhere ... so easy to get anywhere, from the Moana Hotel (just a block or so away), to the local McDonald's on the corner. The staff is quite hospitable and goes out of their way to accommodate requests. We were especially pleased with Argie and Greg. The negative is that the hotel is really 'tired' ... the furniture in the rooms is old and scratched and dented, even though you can see, that at some point, they were lovely black veneer Chinese. The carpets are stained. The elevator is an E ride in Disneyland! We were originally assigned an oceanview room on the third floor, but after one night (and a request from us) we were moved to the sixth floor. You can tell that this hotel was originally a lovely boutique hotel, but needs some TLC (new carpets, furniture, paint) to get it back to where it might have once been. The rooms are small, but that was to be expected, considering the boutique atmosphere.If you are going to Hawaii and expect a 4* atmosphere, this hotel is not for you. If you have a good sense of humor about things and realize that you got a heck of a deal for a grand location and if you are out of the room most of the day and into the night, then go for it.There was nothing like waking up in the morning to the sounds of the birds in the Banyan tree directly across the street waking up, too. And at night, listening to the business of the street below ... and the feeling of the warm Hawaiian breeze ... well, we liked it ... and would do it again.","Dec 17, 2008","1","1",5,3,6,3,5,5,1,"3","$147"

I would stay here based just on that fact alone. The room attendants are very friendly and courteous. Trust worthy! The front desk staff are over the top. They will do anything for you. Greg helped us out both times that I stayed there and he was amazing. I cant wait to go back and visit. I would highly reccomend this hotel to everyone I meet and would definately go back.

"hotel_172","hotel_3753","nice but... Nice hotel for the price, great location but buyer beware on the cheaper rooms. Standard Interior Room means no windows! These rooms do have frosted jalousie windows in the door which opens to the hallway (which is tiny and open to the outside so there is a chance of fresh air while sacrificing security and privacy). Moderate Hotel Room comes with a lanai (balcony). Cool! Except the view is a blank concrete wall of the parking garage behind the hotel. Sound echoes off this wall into your room making it quite noisy with the door open until later at night when traffic dies down and the ac units are shut down next door. This is the room we had for three days. 'Partial Ocean View means no lanai/balcony and room on the side of the hotel near the back. Probably the best of the cheap rooms but it sure is nice to have a lanai in Hawaii. The best rooms are on the front of the hotel and have full ocean views and lanais. If you plan to stay more than a few days pop for one of these rooms and enjoy the sunset with a nice drink. I suggest a can of Pass-o-guava with vodka poured in... shake and drink... better than the candy sweet tropical drinks at any of the big hotel bars.

The staff was amazing - from tips on food and hiking spots that only locals know, to being very friendly anytime day or night. Trevor at the front desk was the best and helped us beyond what he should have. If you are looking for a 5-star and book this one - you'll be dissapointed. If you don't mind a few cracks on the floor or a stained carpet (since you don't eat off it) this is your place. Central Waikiki, beachside and lots to do in the area. If you like a friendly place to stay and want to save a few bucks - you're at home. We stayed for 6 nights, had not 1 problem the whole time. Breakfast was continental - pastry, fruit, juice and coffee - enough to satisfy your hunger and get out into the fresh air. For our 1 year anniversary - I have to say thanks to the hotel and staff for allowing us to stay and spend our money on the rest of our trip and not the hotel. Sure, the room was small, but we didn't visit Hawaii to stay in the room. The shower was fun and we could see the beach and our TV from the bed. IF you let the little things in life get to you - don't stay here and take away a good thing with your bad review. If you like to take it easy and don't mind a non-perfect hotel - book it and have a great time where you want to.

The staff at this hotel are amazing, I have never met a group of people that are friendlier then them. The room attendants always say hello when they see you in the elevators and the hallways and try to make a point of remember which room you stay in. The staff always greet you in a friendly manner when you walk past and always have a smile on their face. Although the rooms arent that big, when you are on vacation how much time are you really spending in your hotel room anyway.

"hotel_172","hotel_1093","Location, Location, Location! I stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Beachside from August 27th - September 1st. I do alot of research on hotels before booking online, and using Tripadvisor, I found the reviews for this particular hotel to be 50/50. Because of the great price I got through Expedia.ca, I decided to take my chances on the Aqua Waikiki Beachside and was not disappointed. First off, you have to keep in mind how many stars a hotel is rated, and what you are paying per night, and that way, your expectations will be realistic. I am a germophobe, so that is my main concern whenever I book a hotel. The Aqua is an older hotel as many in Waikiki are, however, I found it to be relatively clean, and the cleaning staff were very friendly and were helpful in retrieving items I requested such as sewing kits or extra toilet paper. Yes, the decor is outdated and the pink carpets dirty-looking, however, many people in Waikiki walk around barefoot, so I am assuming, after all these years, the hotel carpets must have absorbed dirt and debris from any feet that may have stepped on those carpets, along with normal wear and tear. I bring my own slippers when I travel, so I was not phased by the discolouration. Even if a carpet looks clean, I would never go barefeet on it because looks can be deceiving.When you book a room, be mindful of what type of room you are booking. I booked a 'moderate hotel room' which gave me a partial view of the beach across the street, but for more money, you could get a room with an oceanview, or for less money, an interior room with no windows. That might be a tad claustrophobic for some, so do take note of what you are booking and don't assume anything. If you are clear on the details, you will know what to expect.The room I got was not huge by any means, but was liveable for 2 people, and we did get a queen bed. I read some reviews where people ended up with 2 twin beds instead of a queen or king, but remember, your requests are not guaranteed especially if you have late check-in because like all hotels, rooms are based on availability. The type of room you book, such as an oceanview or partial view, will be guaranteed, since the prices are higher for those, but bed type might not be. Do always call or email the hotel to check or confirm if you have any concerns. Hotel staff are there to help. An added bonus is the small fridge where you can store leftovers or drinks. The hotel is not 5-star by any means, so you have to expect that you will not get 5-star service or amenities like you would at the Hyatt. The free continental breakfast is nothing special but is great if you want a quick bite in the morning and save some money on breakfast. It's free, so people should really stop complaining that it doesn't offer variety. You have about 4-5 kinds of pastries/muffins, 2 types of juice, bananas, oranges, and coffee and tea. i think that's pretty good for free. If you don't like it, then go buy a real breakfast. You always have a choice. The entrance is a little hard to find if it is dark or if you do not know where you are going, so make sure you check for the address and directions before you leave the airport. It's very close to the Hyatt, so if you see that, then you know you are there. The location is super because you are literally across the street from Waikiki Beach and the Police Station. You will be close to many shops, restaurants, International Marketplace, Royal Hawaiian Centre, etc. Kalakaua Avenue, where the hotel is located, is a major tourist hub, so walking along the street at night, you will see buskers/artists do their thing, and it is very safe. Downtown Honolulu and Chinatown are a little sketchy at night, and I would not venture out there in the evening, so if want to explore those places, do so in the morning. There is a free hula show at Waikiki Beach at 6:30PM every night (weather-dependent), and it is right across the street from the hotel. You can also catch the sunset around that time, as it tends to get dark fairly early there (around 7-7:30PM).If you are planning to do a tour of the island, North Shore, Pearl Harbour, etc., I would not buy tickets online beforehand, since when you get to Waikiki, you will notice tons of people on street corners handing out pamphlets for cheap tours. Do your homework and research though, or else you can get ripped off or take a tour that is not to your liking. Make sure you use a tour company that is legit and don't get sucked into those timeshare companies. Know what you want and ask the right questions. If you are to book online beforehand, I would use Discover Hawaii Tours site since I booked a tour with them through Expedia. Going directly to the source itself will save you some money, I realized later. If you go to International Marketplace or Duke's Lane for souvenirs, know that you can barter, and if you start walking away after they give you a price, it always goes lower. In fact, it can go down several times since every cart sells the same stuff, and you can always go to another vendor.If you are taking kids with you, the Honolulu Zoo, along Kalakaua Avenue, is one of the best zoos I've been to! It is not too big but has all of the cool animals that kids like to see (i.e., tigers, chimps, elephants, etc.). Plus, it's only $8 for adults, and $1 for kids under 13 or 14!! Can't get any better than that.Sea Life Park is overpriced for what you see, so I would not go out of my way to visit. The luau there has a fabulous menu though, but all luaus are cheesy and not worth the money. You have to go to one though when in Hawaii, so that one's not bad. Buying tickets through a tour company was $10 cheaper than what is advertised through the Park itself, so look around. Good thing about the Sea Life Park luau was that you get free admission to the park for use within 30 days after. That's how I found out the park really sucked, but at least I didn't pay for it.Anyways, hope all of this is helpful! Have fun in Hawaii!!","Sep 9, 2008","5","5",4,3,6,4,4,5,1,"3","$147"

At first glance the Aqua beachside is definitly tacky.... the pink carpet, walls and even pink fabricated head boards are a little out of date but they are working on doing renos. We later realized that even though it did seem tacky at first... its actually a really cute and has a ton of character. IT may not be the newest or the nicest place Ive ever stayed but it was super cute. Besides the staff the next best thing about this hotel is definitly the location... literally across the street from the beach! You couldnt ask for a better spot. Our first day we walked out the front door a watched a surf competion right on Waikiki beach. So if your looking for a place tto stay that is friendly, cute, cheap, clean and a great location then this is your place. If your looking for somewhere high end, classy, and romantic.... try the Hilton. I have nothing but good things to say about the Aqua beachside and its staff......Hi Trev and Greg!!","Aug 3, 2008","0","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$147"
"hotel_172","hotel_6057","Looks like it was a nice hotel...once upon a time I knew a bit about the hotel before heading in, so I wasn't overly disappointed. However, there are some things that the hotel could be doing to make a more pleasant stay for their guests, that they're not doing at the moment. I and two others stayed in two separate rooms for 4 days this July.The desk manager was very polite and helpful...and a looked a little overwhelmed at times. I knew the rooms were on the small side before booking, so that wasn't a surprise. However, I was somewhat surpirsed to see the run down condition of the place. The shower lining was old and leaked, cabinets were chipped, wall paper peeling, etc. Still, for the location and a decent price I can get over that. Other than a filthy looking carpet, the rooms were clean. The decor throughout the entire hotel looked like it was probably FANTASTIC once upon a time, but has since really deteriorated.Housekeeping was hit or miss. Sometimes they'd clean in the bathroom, sometimes not. Sometimes you'd get a replacement washrag and hand towel, sometimes not. When we called the front desk asking, eventually they said they were out. Yet we discovered later....by being nosy and looking in cabinets on our floor...that they did indeed have washrags... ;(I think what bothered me the most was the used mattresses piled in the 2nd floor hallway and also in the outdoor eating area. Not only was this really tacky looking, it could be a potential heath hazard as the rain creates mold, etc in/on the ones outside. It's probably expensive to dispose/move them out, but shouldn't that be a high priority for the owners if they're refurbing? Most people eat the continental breakfast out there on 3 tables that aren't buried by mattresses.One HUGE positive to this hotel is location. It's literally across the street from Waikiki beach. If the current owners stick with it and put the funds into the hotel necessary to bring it back up to the level it once seems like it was, WOW. Right now, if you don't mind clutter, marginal housekeeping, I'd say it's ok for you. Otherwise, pay a little bit more for the other hotels on the same street.","Jul 9, 2008","1","1",3,4,6,3,5,3,1,"3","$147"

The bones of the place are pretty gross and I can only imagine we selected that hotel based on the wrong review or something. Fortunately they were kind enough to allow us to transfer over to Beachside. For $20 more we went from a bad motel to the cutest little hotel right there on the beach. The room was slightly aged but had a charming historic asian design to it. We were staying only one night before our cruise started but we were so thankful to have stayed there.

We knew starting off that we would not be spending much time in our room, so we went budget and we are sure glad that we did! The staff was awsome, front desk was sooo helpful (call hotel directly for room upgrades. They will beat any advertised price and check for daily parking rates, we paid at check in and saved 60 dollars!) The continental breakfast was basic, but did the trick.

Interior does need updating and is rather worn and dated - however, location compensates for this.Breakfast is a bit of a joke though and unless you are there when it goes out forget it, my 1st morning there I arrived at about 8.15am to be told there was nothing left!

If you look close, you can tell it's been around awhile, but everything is clean, fresh and updated. The room is amazing. It comes with three queen beds! The bathroom was adequate, but the shampoo and conditioner was out of this world, made with local ingredients. The room was extremely large and very clean, with a small refrigerator and microwave for our use. We were lucky enough to have a corner room so because of that, we had two balconies, one overlooking the busy street (great for people watching) and one that you could get a glimpse of the ocean from. The hotel is a few blocks from the ocean, but well worth the walk. Close to restaurants, shopping and just about anything that you could ask for. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

But nothing could out do the horrible dirty worn carpet. It was supposed to be pink but it was grey in path areas. The bathroom had been redone and was great. Other than the worn icky conditions, the linens, etc were clean. The hotel is being refirbished, which was not a problem....but they really should not rent out those rooms until they take up that carpet. We were too embarrased to have our other family members up to our room. Now the view was spectacular. Full front on view of wakiki beach....amazing. And the location is fabulous. I wouldn't stay at this hotel until ALL the work has been done....especially the carpet. The rooms don't look anything like the online pictures. The staff was nice.

The room was shabby  dimly lit which helped to hide the poor condition of the furnishings. The bed although comfortable had a large piece of hardboard under the matress to support the springing  the carpet was old  deteriorated. The bathroom was of a better standard with an excellent shower!!On the upside..the staff were very friendly  helpful with advice on things to see  do.The only other moan is that upon check-out we were charged $18 per night for car parking  not the advertised price of $10.. I think that the new owners would be be wise to close the hotel down until refurbishment is completed rather than try to mix guests with building work  so risk a bad reputation for the future!!","Mar 7, 2008","0","0",3,3,2,4,5,5,1,"3","$147"

"hotel_172","hotel_9659","Disappointment I never added my comments before but I was so disappointed with this experience I just had to let others know. The day we arrived the hotel was in in their first day of new ownership by the Aqua group. When we were checking in I had requested a room with a view, although the reception person didn't answer me, it appearred that he heard me. He advised us of all the extra charges at that time. Using the safe $100, local phone calls $1 each...This hotel is quite old but clean  neat. The room that was assigned to us had a beautiful bathroom, glass shower... 2 single beds  the view was a cement wall, but we did have a patio. When I called the desk to let them know there were single beds  my reservation said double bed. I was informed that you cannot request what size of bed you get. I asked the attendant if it seem right that a married couple should have single beds, anyway, I asked to be moved to a room with double bed  view as my reservation stated but he said there were no rooms. I attempted to use the phone after speaking to the desk but now the phone wouldn't work. We decided to try to make the best of it  go for a walk on the beach. The beach was right a cross the street from the hotel, beautiful sand, easy to get in the water there. Local renting surf boards, burger shack, lots of people. When we returned from our walk I asked if the phone had been fixed yet but no one seemed to care. I had had enough so I asked to be moved to another hotel. They moved us to the Aqua Palms  Spa. This hotel was exactly what I had requested, view , king bed, staff were absolutely wonderful. We stayed there for three nights.

If your looking for full on resort than this is not your place but it was perfect for what we needed. The rooms are small and there is no pool on site.

"hotel_172","hotel_8793","Heed the warnings! My wife and I stayed at the Beachside Hotel for 6 nights in October 2007. I am very dissappointed. We booked our room several months ago and paid for a beachfrontal facing room with a queen size bed. When we got to the hotel and checked in they informed us that they did not have a room with a queen size bed, but rather a room with two twin beds. This was not a problem for a night or even two. However they were not able to place us in the room I booked at all during our entire stay. This is very sad given that this was our honeymoon and my wife and I did not even get to sleep in the same bed one night. Unfortunately there was nothing I could do about this situation since my booking says in small print that rooms are subject to availability. In addition to the extreme inconvenience of the bed situation, the room was extremely small. It was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. There was not even a place to to set and open my suitcase, let alone my wife's, except for the bed or on the floor. And, the rooms and the rest of the hotel, including the elevator to the lobby, are old and worn badly. The carpet in the room was gross and dirty, light bulb burnt out in the old lighting fixture on the wall, etc...Aside from these unpleasantries I will say the location of the hotel is excellent without a doubt. Also we did have a very nice view of Waikiki beach and the ocean from our room.

The rooms, at the time we were there at least, needed some work. The shower did seem to have some leaking issues, but the bathroom was clean. We specifically asked for a double bed when booking but our room had 2 twins (it was so late at night, and we knew we just needed the 1 night stay, so we just lived with it.) At the time the hotel was having issues with water damage (there had been a record amount of rainfall right before we got there,) and so part of the lobby was having work done.Still, the continental breakfast was nice to have, and the staff was friendly and helpful - they held our bags for us the next day while we went out for a few hours and killed time before our cruise boarded -- even after we checked out.

"hotel_172","hotel_4581","Great Location! We stayed at this hotel from Sept 4th to the 13th for 9 days. We were alittle worried after reading about all the negatives of this hotel. Bottom Line, the hotel is alittle worn(funrniture, carpet, and general appearance) but for the location I would give it an A++++++. The rooms were very clean and the people friendly and helpful. They supplied beach towels whenever we needed them. The morning continental breakfast consisted of coffee, tea, juice and donuts or muffins. Not much, but it gave your day a start. We met alot of nice people during the Breakfast hour from 7:30 to 8:30. We never saw any mold in our room, and no smells. My husband was able to use his laptop on the balcony each night and it was free. I think you need to be on a higher floor to get it. Make sure you pay the extra to get ocean front. The views are great, sunsets terrific, and people watching a bonus. We were in room 901. Avoid the back rooms because they face a wall.This is a great place if you are on a budget. Why pay 300-400 a night for the more expensive hotels. The cost of everthing seems to have gone up since our last visit to Oahu 5 years ago. There is no pool here, which we knew about., but you have that yummy beach and ocean just accross the street. If we make it back to Waikiki again we would choose this hotel for the price, and location.. Save yourself some money on the cost of the higher hotels and spend the difference on other things. Plus, it was so convienent having a hotel that you could zip in and out of. Parking is 9.50 per day.

The room itself was very small. It had no phone to identify the front desk , housekeeping and the like. No message notification possibilities either. There was a distinct odor to the room of being stale and moldy. The bathroom shower was clean, thankfully. I can't say as much for the toilet. The sink and vanity were in bad need of repair.

"hotel_172","hotel_10174","The worst hotel we've ever stayed in They say don't judge a book by its cover, but I think in this instace..what you see is what you get. We decided to go with this hotel based on peoples recommendations from this website. We were on our honeymoon and looking for a place to crash for a couple of days before we relocated to another part of Oahu. We felt quite priveledged when we walked in and received an upgrade because of the 'honeymoon' status...that was...until we got to the room. The room was tiny (no where to store luggage, could not swing a cat in the room). The carpet was filthy, there were lights hanging off the wall in bedroom, there was mould on the walls and surrounding the airconditioning etc.. The only good thing about the room was the seemingly ok bathroom and the view from the tiny lanai. After doing some exploring, we returned to our room to find that it was smoke filled with some putrid electrical scent. It was so unbearable that we retreated to the lanai. We contacted reception (in which we had to wait 10+ minutes for the guy to finish his smoko) to try an resolve the issue and he encouraged us to return to our room and await his call to notify us what he could do as he needed to call management. In the same breath as saying this he also informed us that the people in the room below also had to be moved because of electrical smoke filling their room. He did not seem so alarmed by this, however at this stage we were starting to suspect an electrical fire in the airconditioning unit (servicing the whole hotel) and that in fact and evacuation may have been a better suggestion. After waiting over 1/2 hour to get an outcome we then went down again and he had alledgedly been calling the wrong room! He then finally agreed to change our room after much insistance...however informed us that all he had to offer was a twin room with views of the wall (not ideal on your honeymoon). We insisted this was inadequate and asked for a transfer to an alternative hotel. We ended up staying at a sister resortquest hotel (the circle hotel) next door which was cleaner, bigger and the staff were much more obliging than the beachside hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We have stayed in better youth hostels/backpackers than this hotel!","Jul 21, 2007","9","9",3,2,5,2,3,3,1,"3","$147"

On our last day we took a tour (Roberts Travel) not the shore excursion to Pearl Harbor  City tour that dropped us off at the hotel. Well, actually they dropped us off around the corner at another ResortQuest Hotel, but a very pleasant bellman took us around the corner to our hotel.We were suprised at the size of hotel (very small, but acceptable). We stayed in 702 (oceanfront @ $125.00/day). The room was a little larger than the stateroom on our cruise, but had a much better view. If all you are looking for is a bed, this is the place for you. You aren't going to kickback in the room and relax after a long day. If there are more than 2 and I do mean 2, get a larger room. Even an infant in that room would be uncomfortable. The staff is excellent and very helpful. The lobby area is very nice and very relaxing. The air conditioning worked great. They must have a humidifer (clothes felt a little damp and bathing suit took 2 days to completely dry (should have put suit on lani to dry). Furniture in room looked like it had seen better days, but the bed was comfortable.Just ignore the timeshare guys at the door to the hotel. If you are inclined to go to a timeshare presentation, figure out the most expensive thing you what to do and tell them when they start talking. Then tell them you aren't interested you already own a timeshare and you really don't have time. We were at a Speciality tours place (next to Cheeseburger in Paridise resturant) they were going to give us 2 tickets to the Polynesian Cultural Center ($40.00 ea) and a daily rental car. If you are good and enjoy that game you can get pretty much what you want.We didn't have our computer, but staff told us about an internet cafe not far from hotel. Rates were very reasonable $6.00/hr or $1.00/10 mins.Staff arranged a shuttle to the airport for $8.00. They were on time and pleasent.We didn't have a car, so we saved $9.50/day parking. You really don't need one if you take tours, enjoy the beach or get familiar with the local bus system. Buses can take you just about anyplace you want, if you have the time.The beach was across the street. There is a food place (Name may have been Hilton Cafe) (behind the police sub-station) that had good food and cheap for what you got. The hot dogs were $3.50 and large enough for 2. (Not 2 growing boys). They had sea salt encursted pork, mashed potatoes  somethig else for $6.00. Unfortunately, that was on Sunday and we didn't find this place until the day we left. Everyday they have a special, I think Wed was chicken. Also, they close at 6:00 PM. You can sit and watch the surfers getting their instructions or just enjoy the beach view.The International market is a short walk. There you can find ladies making lei's that sell for $5.00, a food court that has a varity of reasonable menus and just about any gifts you want to take home at reasonable prices. DO walk around and price what you want. The same item can very from $5.00 to $10.00.I'll try to post some photos of hotel later.Enjoy","Jun 30, 2007","6","6",4,4,6,6,6,6,2,"3","$147"

The guidebook recommended the higher floors (8 through 11) - for an unobstructed view over the large banyan tree that is located directly across the street. being on the top floor is most if not all of the VIP room's appeal.I'll start off with the good: The views were incredible!! We had a nicely sized lanai overlooking all of Waikiki... you were looking down on al the action on the entire Kalakaua Avenue strip, the beach, water to the horizon... just amazing! You could scope out an open piece of beach and head downstairs to claim in within minutes (the only delay being the ultra-slow elevator). There was also Hawaiian music being played in the evening under the banyan tree and it was really beautiful music... a perfect complement to a relaxing evening on the lanai. It was worth the price of the room alone.Now the bad: You knew there must be a catch with $160 for this view... and there were multiple catches... a. the room was incredibly small, b. requests made via their special request section on the site were all ignored, c. the exterior of the hotel is really run-down d. the carpets were gross... they were pink colored so the dark patches were very visible... e. the furniture was rickety... the doors on the TV stand were falling apart... f. the shower was stupidly designed so that you had to be 'in' the shower in order to test the temperature... ouch!, g. they had this super annoying tour guide guy working the front door harassing you each time you walked in with lines like hey, where are you come from? - and he was affiliated (in some way) with the hotel!Lots to say there - but, all in all, yes - I'd probably stay there again at that price. Simply, the location + views beat out cheaper options in lesser locations and I'd take the aforementioned downsides to save $200 every night against the four-star options next door. Recommended, but with a few warnings.","Mar 31, 2007","8","8",5,3,6,3,5,3,1,"3","$147"
"hotel_172","hotel_4899","Bit of a disappointment We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights previous to a timeshare exchange. We booked it as part of a flight package. With 4 different ResortQuest hotels in the area, it's important to know which one you're looking at when you research. I was looking at pics  reviews of ResortQuest Waikiki, obviously in error.The location is wonderful, right across from the beach, and a block from the Pacific hotel, 2 blks from the Marriott, and not far from the zoo. The staff is helpful, and It's nice to have the complimentary breakfast (from 7:30-8:30..on the dot!), but that was the best part.Our tiny room faced a blank wall. The carpet was dirty, there was little water pressure on the cold water side, and a bad leak under the sink. The maintenance man said he'd have to shut all the water off to fix it...and said the whole hotel was due to be converted to condos in a month. That explained a lot about the condition of the place. It's destined for improvement, at last.","Mar 30, 2007","1","1",3,2,5,4,6,5,1,"3","$147"

The hotel needs a big make over.The pictures shown must have been 20-25 years ago. Our rooms were facing the street and the sunsets were outstanding. I recomend a room facing the street because some rooms face a WALL. The rooms are small and their was mold on the ceiling in the bathrooms. Our friends bathroom the paint was falling off and there was mold. The bed was clean and comfortable.Coffee in the morning was good, but the rolls were cut in half and came from Costco.

Having being to Waikiki beach before, my girlfriend advised me of the Hotel that her and her family had stayed in the last time they stayed in Waikiki. Unfortunately, this was NOT it.Just to make things clear for some people who may be confused as we were.. there are two Hotels not far from each other on Waikiki Beach. One is the Resortquest Beachside Hotel (the one we ended up staying in), the other is Resortquest BEACH Hotel (the one we wished we stayed in).Having booked the wrong hotel, and not knowing until we actually arrived.. the first night was not an extremely happy one.BUT...Apart from the similar name to a much more Fancier hotel, there was nothing wrong with this hotel at all. Sure, the rooms are not that big.. but for just the two of us staying, there was no need for it. Sure theres no pool, but there is THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BEACH RIGHT OUT THE FRONT.This hotel was amazing for its location, and price. The staff were MORE than helpful, always greeting you with a smile and a very welcoming ALOHA! It was just great!The room we stayed in did not stink, did not have sticky floors or carpets.. It was fine. We got a good nights sleep everynight (except after we got burnt to the crisp after forgetting to put on sun screen lotion!)I doubt that anyone would end up spending a lot of time in their hotel room when you are on the worlds most famous beach.So despite the upset of our own faults, this hotel was absolutely perfect for our needs, and I would definetely stay here again!","Nov 5, 2006","10","10",5,4,6,5,4,5,1,"3","$147"

We had two kids, 3 and 6 and this was a good hotel with them. They gave the kids a fun bad with a bucket and shovel. No internet access in the rooms yet. You can go to the lobby and pay 15 cents a minute for internet access. They have a decent hot breakfast that you can take out to the beach, though you have to fight the pigeons if you do. They do kind of lock you into valet parking at $15 a day. there is a $9 option at one of their sister hotels a block away. The rooms were clean.

"hotel_172","hotel_6754","Literally steps to the beach! I went to this hotel for a week's vacation to Waikiki. My sister and I went for the beach and the sights. All we did at the hotel was sleep. Yes, it is small, yes it had carpeting that left something to be desired. It was EXTREMELY reasonable for the location, which is fantastic. And as some have written, I found the service to be VERY attentive. The maid worked around our sleeping schedule, which was unpredictable and erratic, and everything we needed or asked for we got. Terri is wonderful. She hugged us when we left. We were ABC's best customers that week and it was right out our door. The beach is literally out the front door. Less than a minute to jump in the water. If I was going to Hawaii to lay in my room this wouldn't be my first choice, but it served my purpose. It is in the middle of everything and we did it all! If I wanted to spend more, I would have. I prefer to spend my $$$ on shopping, dining, and sights. C'mon people! You get what you pay for. I would go back.

"hotel_172","hotel_2872","Loved it!!!!!! Okay, here it is!!!! We just returned today at noon-time East coast time. Loved it!!!!! We stayed in Waikiki at this hotel for 10 nights. I was very weary about staying at the Beachside when I read some of the other reviews, but I am glad I stayed here. You could not have asked for a better location, the staff was wonderful, and the Boutique-styled hotel was a plus! The rooms were small but very clean!My husbaand and I love to travel and we have stayed in a lot of hotels, motels, and time-shares, but we loved this hotel. Once you entered the doors it was so peaceful and pleasant. I agree with those previous travellers that said it was older and a bit warn (carpets), but I found it to be very quaint and comfortable. We would have probably been writing a very different review had we NOT chosen the Ocean-front room. The view was wonderful. The hey is to get a room that looks OVER the big tree in front of the beach. Yes there are bigger and better hotels in Waikiki, but the ones we visited (ie, Royal Hawaiian, Hyatt, Sheraton, various Outrigger Resorts) were so commercial and busy with shoppers. We loved that we could be in the hustle and bustle and then retire to a quiet and small hotel.I have to mention this...The bathroom shower had the best water pressure I have ever experienced. You could stay in the shower for 30 minutes and the water nevered cooled down!!!!(One last thing) The elevator, someone mentioned that it was low...We never had to wait more than 45 seconds for this thing. Yes it was small, but it did it's job. Just think of this hotel as a 'hotel-styled bed and breakfast with some aging for character. Loved it, loved it, loved it, and would definately stay again!!!!!","Jun 19, 2005","38","38",5,4,1,6,1,6,1,"3","$147"

I chose this hotel because of location  price. We wanted to spend our $$ on excursions on the other islands. The location is terrific. It is right across the street from the beach. We had an oceanfront room so the view was super. However, the hotel is old  worn. The showerhead popped off  struck my wife on the head, leaving a bruise. The staff was just okay. We were not particularly impressed. This hotel is a little less expensive, but you will have to settle for less.

No swimming pool but there's the beach and boogie boarding and surfing lessons right there in front. Get your Maui Babe suntan lotion and feast on the sun tanning opportunity. The view was superb from our balcony. The free continental breakfast was great and with the bed tray, you can bring the muffins, croissants, coffee and juice (real!) up to your room. This is a small boutique hotel with friendly staff and location, location, location! We got a great room with a great view but yes some rooms are without windows or look out onto a wall. Get out of the room and see Oahu and the North Shore and the malls and just sleep in there! You're not buying the place but just sleeping there.

"hotel_172","hotel_9815","The Little BeachSide Hotel that Could....... This was my first time in Hawaii, so when I got there I wanted everything to be nice and smooth. I bought my packaged deal from Pleasant Holidays and I think they did an overall good job with the booking. Check-in was easy. If your trying to look for this hotel make sure ALL YOUR PASSENGERS ARE LOOKING TO THE LEFT to find the entrance to this club, i mean HOTEL. If you blink, you will certainly miss the hotel because I had to drive around 3 times just to find it. I even went to the wrong Aston Hotel chain and they told me I was at the wrong hotel. I felt so touristy. When I finally got to my hotel, the staff was very friendly. When I saw the elevator to go up to our room, I thought at first if it was the food elevator for room service, but turns out that little elevator was the mode of transportation up to our rooms. Just make sure when you go to the elevator, there isn't a crowd with you unless you want to be rubbing up on someone's tanning lotion. When I opened to the door to my room, my eyes widened with such a surprisement. The pictures on the Internet can really decieve you on how big the room can look. The room is really good enough for 2 people, MAX! I had an ocean-view room fortunately so I had a balcony over-looking Waikiki beach. Thank goshers for the balcony. It saved the room. If it wasn't for the view, I would have developed CLAUSTROPHOBIA on the spot! The room service cleaned our room everyday and made it nice and neat. This service is greatly appreciated after a night of drinking on the patio. The hotel also offers its guests free towels and sand mats for beach use, which became very useful. Location was very good too. ABC store to your right, left, back, front, on the beach, everywhere. Everything is walking distance from this hotel so that saved alot of time driving everywhere. Only problem I had with the location of the hotel is getting on the H1 EAST!!! took me about 2 tries to find the shortest path to enther this highway. Other than that, this hotel did it's job. saved me $ and I got a great view of the beach from it. If you stay at this hotel, jus make sure you get an oceanview room, you wouldn't want a view of the senior citizens next door!","Nov 24, 2004","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3","$147"

"hotel_172","hotel_4647","Great Staff, Great Location! As most of the other reviews already mentioned, the staff at this boutique hotel was wonderful. Ricky was always patient and helpful with the many questions we had for him. He also gave us a great deal on upgrading to an ocean view room on the 9th floor (we were supposed to get the windowless room). He and Shane also recommended going through Cheap Tickets to book luaus/tours...as Shane instructed, just look for the lady passing out orange flyers in front of the McDonald's right next door and give Cheap Tickets a call. We booked a luau at Germaine's and snorkeling at Hanauma Bay w/transportation and gear for about $45. Although the hotel warned us not to use Mr. K/Dr. K as our transportation provider to Hanauma Bay (bad customer service and they were right!), they ended up being the company Cheap Tickets deals with for transportation. I requested 6:45AM pick up and the morning of, when I called Mr. K to confirm, he wanted us to take the 8:30AM departure instead since it would just be my friend and I that he would be taking. I stated that we wanted to go early and that when we booked, we were promised a 6:45 pick up...he said the earliest he could come was 7:10AM. He was 15 minutes late and when we got in the car, didn't even say a word to us. I had to repeat a question two times before he even responded. We also requested for pick up from Hanauma at 12:00 but again, he was not flexible because he wanted the car to be full instead of only 2 passengers. I told him that the hotel was kind enough to give us late checkout until 2:00PM so I just wanted to make sure we got back by that time. He said he could only come back at 12:50PM (he then gave us the option of 10:50AM but that didn't give us much time to snorkel the beautiful bay). We didn't get back to the hotel until 1:40PM or so because the shuttle decided to pick up another pair of passengers at Diamond Head who weren't even there!Of course, the hotel staff was kind and understanding about our tardiness because they knew that Mr. K's service is not very reliable or punctual. So if you are on a time constraint or appreciate friendly service, I suggest not going through Mr. K.I would definitely stay at this hotel again...yes the rooms are small but you should be spending most of your time outdoors!

I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect. The room was small but nice. Upon hearing that we just got married, the desk clerk upgraded us to a full ocean view room and sent up a split of champagne 鈥?a very nice touch.

We were a little nervous since we booked a room with no windows, but we were on a budget and figured we wouldn't be spending much time in our room anyway. Far and away the best thing about this hotel is the staff. They were as friendly and helpful as could be. I called them and asked about the windowless rooms, and they said that if, upon arrival, there were partial or ocean view rooms available, they would upgrade us for less money than it would be if we booked a partial or ocean view room in advance. It added a little excitement to the experience and when we arrived that was precisely the case. They offered to upgrade us to a partial ocean view for $10 more a night, or to a full ocean view for $20 a night (as opposed to I think $80 if we booked an ocean view in advance.) As other reviewers have said, this hotel lacks bells and whistles, but my thoughts are that in Waikiki you don't need your hotel to have bells and whistles. All of the excitement at this hotel is right out the front door on the beach. This hotel truly could not be in a better location.

Booked the room through Expedia and got a great rate of $162 a night for a VIP room on the 11th floor with an unobstructed view of the beach across the street. We even got the seventh night free for booking on Expedia.!We arrived at around 6:30 p.m. Hawaii time from the airport. At first glance I couldn't even tell it was a hotel. No large neon sign exposing the facility. It was conventiently located between an ABC (not a liquor) store and several clothing stores. We were greeted by Eddie and Terrance at the front desk who showed us to our room. All during the week, other employees such as Chanda and Jon gave us good suggestions on where to eat and shop.The Aston Beachside is conviently located around the corner from a city bus stop and across the road from the beach. Duke's canoe bar is located down the road and has great lava flowes! This hotel is definately worth the money due to the location and the staff.A simple breakfast of rolls and coffee w/juice is served from 7:30 to 8:30 each morning. On the weekends afternoon tea is offered also.Simply put, this is a great hotel for the location and cost of the rooms! Our room had two small twin beds with a large bathroom nicely decorated with oriental furniture. Our room had a nice tv with cable in it as well as a refridgerator. The room-length balconey overlooked the street and the beach. It was a very nice view of the ocean and sunsets!If you plan on booking a room here, do so as soon as you can.

"hotel_173","hotel_5602","Loved the Ilima! I stayed at the Ilima for 8 nights in a studio superior room with my husband because of all of the positive reviews we read. We stayed in room 901, which had a beautiful view of the mountains, the Ala Wai Canal and the Ala Wai golf course. This hotel is a great value for $115/night with the 5th night free! I'd highly recommend this room because of the view. Plus, it was very quiet- street noise was not a problem with the balcony door closed. The room was impeccably clean. Make sure you request a mountain view when making your reservation because some rooms only have views of the street and other buildings. Noise might be a problem on lower floors, but it wasn't an issue on the 9th floor. I was extremely surprised to read some other reviewers complain about rude staff because every staff member I encountered during my stay was very friendly and helpful! One staff member offered to lend me a beach umbrella for the week when I inquired about where to buy one. Another staff member suggested a great alternative to the nearby expensive supermarket and gave us detailed directions. The location (10-minute walk to Waikiki beach) was fantastic. The pool was very warm, but refreshing in the evenings when it was a bit cooler outside. The lobby is very pleasant and attractive. I highly recommend this hotel for budget conscious travelers who do not require room service, concierge services, etc. Save your money and stay at the Ilima!

"hotel_173","hotel_1401","Great for families I picked this hotel from reviews I read here, and they are spot on. The location is great, with a small grocery 3 blocks away so one can take advantage of the kitchen facilities. The room is spacious (much bigger than our company-paid room for the other half of our trip at twice the price). The firm beds took a little getting used to, but were fine. The extras like the chocolate-covered macadamia nuts for check-in and the shell leis at check-out were nice. When we arrived Friday morning during the sing-along, we were still able to check in, and although our room wasn't ready yet, we were still able to get towels from the desk and go to the beach. The free parking in the small garage was never a problem, although we did make it a point to be there by late afternoon and do our evenings on foot. The safe was big enough for the laptop. The only minor disappointment was that the pool was closed for repairs when we were there, but these things happen. I would go back again, and heartily recommend it to anyone with kids. If you want valet parking, spas, onsite gourmet meals, etc. go elsewhere. Check the hotel's website (and keep checking back) for great deals.","Sep 29, 2008","2","2",6,5,5,5,5,5,5,"4","$157"

We liked the free parking, and if you come back early enough, there wasn't a problem getting a spot. My husband had difficulty one night finding a spot and he simply parked on the street. The bathrooms were modern, the beds were comfy. They had coin operated washers and dryers, and sold detergent for a nominal fee. The rooms had kitchens with a full size fridge which was convenient. With all the restaurants surrounding us, we never cooked. The hotel offered beach towels and beach mats, which is a nice touch. They also gave us newspapers every day. Upon check out, we each received a shell lei.We got a great rate off of the website. I thought it was great value, a nice place, and an extremely convenient location.","Sep 12, 2008","2","2",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_6504","Very Pleasant Stay If you're looking for a boutique hotel or 5 stars with room service and a restaurant, keep looking. The Ilima is a nice spacious studio with everything that an independent traveler needs. The rooms are simple and clean with a generic d茅cor and firmly comfortable beds. With a fridge, microwave, stove, pots, pans, coffee maker and coffee the only thing you need is your own food. There's a coin operated laundry room on the property. The hotel staff seems to work hard to keep things in good order. There was a problem with an appliance in my room and it was fixed immediately. There is a small pool and dry sauna. Parking is free and I never had a problem finding a spot. All of the staff were cheerful, knowledgeable and professional and it made for a pleasant stay.

Friendly and knowledgeable staff, clean and comfortable room (we had 3 adults and 2 children in a 2 bedroom suite with kitchen) good location (a block from the bus to Pearl Harbor) with the International Marketplace, Waikiki Beach and several good restaurants close by.

"hotel_173","hotel_9383","Great SDtay Stayed in room 909 (from previous guest recommendation since we are smokers) and we loved it..Large rooms and comfortable beds with a full kitchen and large refridgerator..Kid friendly..Kind and helpful staff..Jack in the box around the corner and Macdonalds across and down the street..Perry;s 3 blocks down is worth the buffet price for picky kids and the Galaxy across from starbucks had a good $3.50 breakfast..The small TV was hard to get going and I did see only one roach by the front door. Nice small pool and they will provide matts and towels for the walk through the International market on Dukes Lane to the beach..We did not rent a car but parking was free and the BUS was down @ the corner. We felt safe walking @ night. The only problems we had were calling Waikiki Shuttle (also knows as Kahula five star). We took a bus to the Capitol and the bus drivers were rude and did not help us with where to get off and we got lost and spent a lot of time..We thought the 1 1/2 hour Bus ride to the Arizona would take too long but this shuttle drove around Waikiki hotels for 45 minutes and then took people to the airport (the ad only mentioned the arizona and the Swap meet)...The driver was very rude.. ..We were forced to pay round trip and though they advertise a shuttle every 30 minutes, we waited 1 hr and 10 minutes..I called twice and was screamed @ and hung up on...($24 for 3 people)..Several Buses left and we made a mistake with this as it took 2 hours to get there and 2 hours to get back...Also, we wanted to surprise My Granddaughter with a limosine back to the airport and Honolulu Cab  limosines was a no show and we were forced to grab a cab for $40 at the last minute..We called several times and got voice mail. Beware of transportation problems, especially when you have kids. The zoo was not worth the price but the beaches and free hula show was great.. We had been to Germaines Luau 20 years ago and it was wonderful but this time the food was so bad, the 3 of us could not find anything we could eat and we did not like the atmosphere but I have never been to any of the other Luau's to compare it to..We had a wonderful time otherwise due to this hotel.","Aug 14, 2008","2","1",4,5,5,5,6,6,1,"4","$157"

"hotel_173","hotel_2398","wonderful We stayed here for 5 days at the beginning of our honeymoon, May 19-24. I have to say the entire experience was wonderful, from booking to check out. We booked the room on their website while they were running a special, $125/night for the Deluxe room. The room was huge, with a King sized bed AND an additional double bed, along with the kitchen, desk, and plenty of closet space.We requested a corner room on the 12th floor on the advice of another reviewer, and I received an email from the girl that does reservations asking me what kind of view I wanted (street view or canal view). I told her I wasn't sure, since I've never been there, but mentioned it was for our honeymoon. She was extremely friendly with her advice, and ended up giving us an amazing corner room with a mountain view. When we walked into our room after an excrutiating 10 hour flight, all I can say is it instantly erased our jet lag. The view was absolutely breathtaking. One whole side of the room was floor to ceiling glass. You can see the canal, the mountains, and at night, the beautiful twinkling lights of the city. Besides the great view and rock bottom prices, the hotel offers several amenities that ended up costing us dearly at the other 2 hotels we stayed at during our trip: free parking and free internet access. Not only that, but we didn't realize how handy it was to have a full kitchen. We were able to keep a full case of bottled water and some milk and cereal on hand for early mornings. It's just little ways to save money that really add up in the end. The on-site laundry facilities were very helpful as well. The location is extremely convenient, within walking distance of practically everything.As honeymooners, we picked 3 different locations for the duration of our trip: the Ilima to start, followed by a mid-range resort on the Big Island, then a high-end resort for our last 2 days in Oahu. We actually enjoyed the Ilima the best out of all of them. It's very private and quiet, which was great for us. We always had the pool to ourselves, which was nice because we really enjoyed taking dips at night after spending the day site seeing. We had a lot more opportunity for private, romantic moments at the Ilima than we did at the other resorts that were always brimming with families and other couples.","Jun 2, 2008","5","5",6,5,6,5,6,6,6,"4","$157"

Our plabe arrived quite early - 7am and we arrived at the Ilima at about 8.30am after quite a long shuttle ride. Even though check-in time was 3pm the friendly staff at the desk made a room available and checked us in straight away. This was really appreciated after the flight from Sydney. The rooms are definitely above average in size with a small kitchen and a full size fridge. The room and bathroom were very clean and everything worked. We stayed in two different rooms, firstly on level 11 and then on level 5, both rooms were quiet. Another nice touch is that the reception area has some nice paintings.I'd recommend the Ilima to anyone who wants a hotel in a good location at a reasonable price especially if you plan to do some cooking whilst on holidays.","Feb 13, 2008","5","5",6,5,5,6,6,6,5,"4","$157"

Location is near the Ala Wai canal and about 2 1/2 blocks from the beach. The view of the mountains was awesome. Our rooms were the studio superior style and we had plenty of room. An older hotel so the rooms were not cramped like the newer hotels. The full kitchen was perfect.The staff was always attentive and helpful. You can tell that they are happy you are there. I had a number of questions before our trip and had sent them emails. I got a response within hours. I don't think I have ever been in a hotel this CLEAN. To a person they all said their rooms were immaculate. A great staff with that true hawaiian spirit.The Ilima Hotel does not have the usual restaurant and bar but you didn't need it. You are so close to everything you would ever want. They also provided free parking for our rented van. The Ilima Hotel may not wanted to be recognized for this but they DO NOT discriminate against SMOKERS like all the other hotels. They dedicate 2 floors for smokers. You can smoke in your room but we chose to smoke on the generous lanai only.I hope to go back soon and the Ilima Hotel will be where I stay.A ten out of ten.

"hotel_173","hotel_7422","Good value, clean and quiet. We stayed at the Ilima Dec 4. thru Dec. 9. Because of Pearl Harbor Day and the Honolulu Marathon rooms were scarce. We followed a previous TripAdvisor post and requested the 14th floor with a mountain view and got room 1402, mountain view. We were very pleased with the room: a king and queen bed, kitchenette with range+oven, coffee maker, small breakfast table with two chairs, 6 foot X 12 foot lanai with two lawn chairs, free local phone and free parking. The bathroom had a full tub and shower. The room and public spaces in the hotel appeared to be very clean. This is not a brand new property with flawless paint and deep pile carpets, but it was large, comfortable, and well situated for any Waikki activity. We found the staff to be incredibly friendly and pleasant. We were told that this is a local hotel owned by the same family for many decades (not associated with the Ilima transportation group). If there was any negative in our stay it was that the little coffee packet is not replaced each day, you get one as a 'starter' for your stay and that's it.","Dec 20, 2007","6","6",6,5,5,6,5,5,1,"4","$157"

"hotel_173","hotel_2019","Great Place and location We have just stayed at the Ilima and thought it was great for what we needed. We upgraded our room from a studio to a one bedroom and were happy with what we were given. It was clean and well presented and had most things we needed during our stay. The daily maid service was great too. Its located just off the main Kuhio Road which means that getting on The Bus is really easy if you want to access other parts of the island. You do have to cross a couple of main roads to get to the beach - one of them being a main shopping street so you may feel odd walking there with all your beach stuff, but there are lots of others doing the same so its no big deal. The place does look like it needs updating but its purely cosmetic - its not dirty or anything. The backout blinds were helpful for us as we were travlling with an infant. The only donwside I would say is the very slow check in - after 20 hours travelling from the UK, it took ages!! It was 11.30pm by the time we got there and we would have just liked to have gone to our room but it was probably because there was some confusion over whether we wanted a cot or not. We also had to take our own luggage up - which was fine but some people might get annoyed at that. We took our own cot but they do have them but I think $10 a day is very steep where most other places this is free!The only other downer was that they suggested we use Ilima tours for airport pick up and drop off - not linked to them but reccomended. Pick up from the airport was ok - we did have to wait a while, but the drop off was a nightmare. We waited for 40 mins and they did not come and we got v stressed about getting our connection. The lady at reception was very helpful and called them many times but we ended up getting a cab at huge expense!. Im not sure why they reccomend them as it caused us alot of stress in getting our connection onwards. It would have been good to have had wirelss in our room also rather than the lobby but only a minor point.

"hotel_173","hotel_6807","Enjoyed the stayed @ Ilima We chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on this website. I had an easy time doing the online booking and also emails were answered promptly on inquires. We stayed 2 nights in end Sep 2007.Check in was a breeze, front desk staff are friendly and able to provide information/directions and eating recommendations. There are beach mats and beach towels available at the lobby, just ask from the front desk staff. This hotel is a鈥?no fringe鈥?place; there is no porter or room service. But the hotel location is safe, quiet and good; sits about two blocks away from the beach (less than 10 min walk), just a block away from International Market, quite centrally located in Waikiki district. There is a small pool, laundry room, free parking but the safe box is not free.Our family of 4 stayed in a two-bedroom suite, the lanai view overlooked the street while the bedrooms; one view is the same street, the other is the back of the hotel. My uncle/aunt unit was a studio also with a kitchenette and comes with full length sliding doors(comes with heavy black-out drapes) to their lanai which overlooked the canal, golf course and the mountains. Both units are fully aircon, but if you like fresh air, ilima鈥檚 strategic location gets excellent cross-breezes and so is well ventilated and fresh.Our 2 bedrooms unit has a large kitchenette, fridge, sitting/TV and lanai area. The kitchenette was fully stocked; kettle, coffee maker, pots, pans, toaster, plates and utensils. Everything was very clean. We used the stove to make breakfast and it was nice that bottled water was provided as well. Rooms are ok but the room doors had a bit of problems 鈥?one did not close properly or if you do so, it would required you to use quite a bit of strength to pull it open; the other closes easily but as the bathroom doors opens/closes next to it, the bedroom door will come unlatch from the vibrations. Also it was sometimes noisy for the room facing back of the hotel, as the windows was louvered type (noise is not from the regular traffic as the hotel is along a side street), I was awoken couple of times by the garbage truck making its rounds around the neighbourhood during the early morning wee hours. For my little girl this had no affect and she slept on quite well.My uncle/aunt鈥檚 studio was a very large unit too; I would say it was approximately the same size as our two-bedroom suite but minus the 2 bedrooms. Overall, everything was nice, clean and friendly. Next time, based on the room view and noise, I鈥檒l go for 2 one-studio unit on the mountain side.Oh, if there are more than 2 people going to the airport, consider using the regular taxi/cab this hotel uses. I did for my family of 4, the taxi was a classy white limo driven by the Vietnamese boss; he was very friendly and charged like the regular taxi rates but unfortunately I鈥檇 lost his name card.","Oct 21, 2007","3","3",5,3,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$157"

The windows are louvre type windows so it was quite difficult to shut out the noise. The pool area is very small, but quite nice. The staff were very friendly and most helpful and the apartment was serviced every day.

It's not a five star hotel, but you're not paying 5 star prices! We stayed in 702, which was a studio with a kitchenette that overlooked the canal and golf course. If you could get up a little higher, you'd have a better view. (there was a building partially blocking our view straight out). It was a very large, bright room with large lanai. Everything was very clean. The bathroom looked like it had recently been redone. Family travelling with us stayed in a two-bedroom suite (703). The view on that side overlooked the street, so you might want to try getting a 2 bedroom on the canal side. The staff was excellent, from front desk to housekeeping to the maintenance man who fixed my in-laws door because it shut too quickly for them! We arrived one hour before check in and didn't have to wait at all. Check in was a breeze (for the studio and 2 bedroom suite we had booked), and we were up in our rooms in about 5 minutes.

We watched the outriggers canoe races here on Sundays and that was very nice. This place is really a do it yourself hotel. It does not have porters and no room service.However, the value is very good for a place to stay close to the beach and the shopping. The Island of Hawaii is now a non-smoking island now so the rooms should be losing the smoky smell that we experienced. It wasn't terrible but very noticable to people who do not smoke.

"hotel_173","hotel_8413","Horrible, Smelly, Outdated, unprofessional, low class... I booked with this hotel due to mostly positive feedback from this website. However, when I went to the actual hotel I was in for a big surprise...I arrived at 4pm (1 hour after the guaranteed check in time at 3pm). Upon checking in at the reception counter, I was informed that our room was not ready and would not be so for an hour. I was not bothered too much by this as I am sure it may happen everywhere but I was a little put off that they didn't offer an explanation or an apology just a oh, it's not ready, come back in an hour or so. A nice little bit of unprofessionalism to start off my stay! So. My wife and I decided to just go walk around Waikiki in the meantime. We arrive back at the Ilima almost a full two hours later figuring we'd be able to get into our room. The answer? It's still not ready. Just have a seat and we'll tell you. I was starting to get very irritated at the fact that it was like 6pm and we were stranded in their lobby. Finally, a full 30 minutes later we are informed the room is ready.We booked for a deluxe one bedroom suite (for $283 a night) and when we got up there, we were appalled. The bathtub was rusty and stained and the whole entire bathroom was obviously not kept up. The bed sheets had stains....STAINS of I don't even want to know. The comforter (if you can call it that) on our lumpy bed had small cigarettes wholes all over it and our room smelled like cigarette as well. Overall, the room, furniture, carpet and curtains were very outdated, rundown and NOT CLEAN. This place was a nightmare! We had booked the DELUXE one bedroom suite because we did not want to make the mistake of booking a regular studio room and having a rundown little room. Apparently at this hotel it didn't matter. We immediatly contacted the front desk and politely informed them of our concerns and asked if they may another a different room of the same category they may have. The girl on the other end was very rude and said that since we checked in so late that there was only one other room in our category we could look at. This new room was more of the same!! My wife and I immediatly set out to look for a new hotel because we were not going suffer for the next 9 nights!After about 2 hours of searching we finally found a much nicer place with new, clean and beautiful rooms at the Aqua Palms. The kicker? We were only going to be paying $150 a night for a much much nicer room at the Aqua Palms.The next morning when we were checking, the girl working at the reception desk made the remark that if we wanted a quality room we should have booked the penthouse!!!!! Based on my stay here, I am under the impression that the staff must be writing the reviews to this site because I honestly have no idea how this hotel has a good reputation!! Anyway, I do have one positive thing to say about the hotel: The check out was very fast! It took about 3 minutes.I would never return to stay here nor would I recommend this place to anyone.","Sep 7, 2006","40","31",2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_3188","wonderful place, large room, great staff We stayed here four nights. Book online to get best rates. Upper floors offer great views (ask for mountain view). large fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and stove..didn't use stove..staff was fantastic and always welcoming..location two and half blocks from beach..much quieter than main street area..don't use Ilima Transportation from airport (different company same name, I think) used Ohana to return to airport and got personal great service for $7 pp. Ilima was $9 pp and had to stop everywhere else first (4-5 other hotels)..everything spotless (bathroom very clean and plenty of hot water) had double and king bed so plenty of sleeping space...extra blankets and pillows in drawers...tv ok but could use more channels such as ESPN2 and Weather Channel...great lanai offering great views..laundry room on 3rd floor (didn't use but saw people using--think it's 75 cents a load)...great restaurant around corner called Seaside Bar  Grill-good specials and in Delta Dining program...Cappucinos on Lewers in Waikiki Joy is great little Japanese restaurant with lots of food for money (also in Delta Dining program)..highly recommend Ilima Hotel for families, individuals, couples, etc..clean, safe, convenient to everything but not noisy, crowded area.

"hotel_173","hotel_7704","Loved the Ilima! After arriving at Honolulu airport with no hotel booking  ringing about 20 hotels that were all full, the Ilima hotel had a room. This hotel is amazing with super friendly staff  excellent location. It is just down from the international market place. It is only a 5-7min walk to waikiki beach  close to everything else. The 1 small downside may be a small pool with not much sun. We had a 3night stay here from Sat 12Aug'06. The rooms were huge  clean  we could see some ocean too. We had a kitchenette which was great for making our own b/fast. Would be very happy to stay here again. Highly recommended!","Aug 22, 2006","17","12",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_1142","Another good stay Having had a good experience in the past with the Ilima, my wife and I returned there this year for our honeymoon, on the front and back ends of a cruise. We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms (studio), but the room was very spacious and airy. The staff is friendly, and I recognized the same people who we met during our last stay.There were a couple elements of our stay that were not as good:1. Noise: If you are not used to the city and city sounds, it may not be easy for you to drill out the sounds that many city dwellers are used to (traffic, the beep beep backup sounds of dumpsters being emptied, and so on. In addition, the airiness of the open-air hallways create a strong draft which causes doors to slam if you're not careful. During our stay, we had some very inconsiderate neighbors who continually went in and out of their door, letting it slam very hard behind them. (At 8AM on vacation, that was annoying).2. Parking: The parking garage fills up quickly when the hotel is busy, but there is overflow parking. The spaces are very tight, and it is extremely easy for your car to get dinged (or worse) by another. If you're not used to small city parking garages, be aware of this. The parking is free, though, which is a great plus!On the positive side:1. You get excellent value for the money2. The older gentleman at the tour desk (when we saw him in the past) was very kind and knowledgeable enough3. The desk staff is very friendly and hospitable, particularly the ones who have worked there longer4. Our housekeeper was very sweet and thorough5. The hotel is an easy walk to the International Market (a bit farther to the beach, though)6. The room was very clean with a newer air conditioner (which we used very little). The kitchenette was fine for a short stay.I detected no funny smells that were referred to in a previous review. In fact, I would take the stairs instead of the elevator down, and it was clean all the way to the lobby. I would not call the Ilima luxurious, but it was clean, safe, comfortable, and reasonably priced, especially for Waikiki. We would definitely return there again.","Aug 19, 2006","17","13",6,5,5,6,6,5,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_1023","Wonderful, large and comfortable! My nephew and I enjoyed 5 1/2 days at the Ilima and were so pleased with the accomodations and staff. Everyone was so courteous, friendly and humerous. Our studio #1201 had a fantastic view of the Ala Wai and hills. My nephew enjoyed sitting outside and reading in the early morning.Our room was huge and extremely clean. I read all the previous write ups so we kept our bathroom articles in the large shelved closet outside the bathroom. We stored our empty luggage in the huge storage closet, used the plastic hangars (very nice extra) for wet swimsuits and hung on the shower rod and enjoyed the extra towels we requested each day.The beach mat and beach towels available in the lobby and the proximity to Jack in the Box and Denny's for late night snacks made everything so convenient.Courtni was wonderful to work with at www.ilima.com reservations and Markus, on the front desk, was a wealth of tourist information with a great sense of humor.There are 4 washer and dryers and it's only 75 cents per machine. We didn't use the pool, sauna or exercise room.... no time!The only negative is the narrow parking stalls and I had downgraded to a compact but next time I'm going for an economy car. I had difficulty parking.","Jul 7, 2006","15","13",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_1857","Great Hotel We have stayed at the Ilima hotel numerous times, and have always found it to be worth returning to. On my first stay, and indeed late at night after a long day of travelling I hadnt been very pleased with my first impressions of the hotel rooms which looked less contemporary than the holiday inn type hotels I was used to. If you are looking for a holiday inn type of hotel, you probably will find this to be a slight disappointment. However, after a few days it was obvious that there were many advantages to this hotel. It is not very far from the beach and the shops, but yet far enough that it is quiet and never overly crowded. This is extremely beneficial when you do deal with the front desk or want to swim in the pool as you never need worry about it being too busy which in my books is an absolute treasure on a holiday. As some of the other reviews have pointed out, the pool is smaller than others you will see at surronding hotels, but the fact that you may well end up having the whole pool to yourself seems to much outweigh having a small section of a large one. The staff is friendly and helpful and we have never had any complaints with that area of the hotel. The one thing that I would warn anyone considering this hotel about, is that if you are planning on taking many bus tours, or shuttle services - prepare to be the first hotel of many to be picked up and the last to be dropped off. We learned very quickly that by staying at a smaller less known hotel, that you are low priority for pickups and drop offs, which needless to say can be extremely inconvienient after a long day and has led on occassion to us simply getting off 5 or 6 blocks away at another hotel just to be able to get back faster by walking. Otherwise, we definitely never even consider another hotel when we continue to visit Hawaii as we find the benefits to this hotel definitely outweigh the negatives.","Jun 1, 2006","20","19",5,5,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_3766","Best Kept Secret in Waikiki! This was our first stay at the Ilima hotel and were extremely pleased with our decision. After reading some of the reviews on this website, we started out a little unsure but after checking in and looking around, we quickly disregarded those reviews. The staff was so friendly and helpful and the place was spotless. Our studio room was much bigger than we expected and it came with a full kitchen! The patio was also well sized. With young kids (5 and 7), having a full size refrigerator and freezer really helped. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, toaster, plates and utensils. We used the stove to make breakfast and dinner right in our room. Free parking was available everyday and our kids especially loved the heated pool. One of the best assets of this hotel is their staff. Our light in the kitchen was acting funny and they fixed it without us even having to ask them. My son had to do some homework and the front desk helped us out by letting us borrow their Elmer's glue and well as sharpening our pencils for us. All in all, this was one of the best experiences we've had in Hawaii and with a price of only $88/night this definitely is the best kept secret in Waikiki!","May 13, 2006","24","21",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_1987","Bad choice of hotel We booked this hotel based on a lot of the reviews on this board, that was a mistake. We arrived around 3:00 p.m. after travelling almost 10 hours and were informed (not too politely)that our room was not ready. We should have left then and there but our room was paid for (over $200.00 per night) for the 11 nights we spent there. Everything in this hotel is worn and dated, the kitchen was very poorly equipped, the cups and plates were chipped and cracked and there were stains everywhere. Housekeeping was spotty and not all that great. The pool is a joke. The only good thing about the whole experience was the view, we looked over the canal and golf course which was nice.Last year we stayed at the Sunrise which was wonderful compared to the Ilima, we will never stay at the Ilima again nor would we recommend the place to anyone else.","Mar 27, 2006","34","30",2,2,1,2,1,2,1,"4","$157"

Typically when we travel we stay in a 2-bdr so I was a little concerned we might feel cramped. Not at all; my husband and I were in the bedroom, our 6-yr-old slept on the hide-a-bed, and our 2 1/2-yr-old slept in his portacrib in the living room. The place was spacious and very comfortable. It wasn't the Ritz, but we don't go to the Ritz (nor were we paying for the Ritz). It was a great deal. Really quiet, too---only heard some small kids running in the hall once. Never heard footsteps thudding from above, etc. Great housekeeping service. The room had excellent cross-breezes so was well-ventilated and fresh. Slept with the fan on so never heard any city noise at night. Pool was heated and, although small, perfectly adequate. Very friendly staff. Ample free parking. We walked everywhere---beach looks far-ish on a map, but even with kids, stroller, beach paraphernalia, etc it was no trouble at all to walk down there.

We arrived a full 39 hours late, due to snow in Tokyo, but the hotel did not make us pay for the first night that we weren't there. They even let us stay for an extra night, at the same very low rate.

"hotel_173","hotel_9252","Quiet yet convenient We stayed there in a one bedroom unit for four days. Spacious, clean, very nice newly renovated bathroom,( they know where to upgrade ) Two A/C units, both are old and had to be constantly on high to maintain the temp, wondering how it's going to hold up in the summer. Kitchen is adequately equipped for simple meals, afterall very few people spend much time in their kitchen when visiting Waikiki.Front staff very friendly, but couldn't solve a glitch in my statement when I was inadvertantly billed for three long distance calls I never made. Later on ( long after check out ) they apologized for something the computer did that put those calls from a year ago onto my room. I suggested to them that in the future they should slip the statement under the door the night before check out so guests have a chance to review rather than being caught by surprise at check out while a taxi is waiting.Overall, I am happy with this hotel and will go back again, but will pay attention to the A/C unit at check-in and take time before check-out to go over the statement. Parking is so tight that every guest should rent compact cars.","Feb 17, 2006","18","10",6,5,1,5,1,5,1,"4","$157"

"hotel_173","hotel_4813","overall, pleased! We got back from Oahu on New Year's Day and we stayed at the Ilima for a week with our two children. As everyone has mentioned, it is a great value one block away from the International Market and close to the beaches, restaurants and stores. This is a quiet building with a very accomodating staff, free parking and a small (but enjoyable) pool. We used the sundeck on the 10th floor a few times because the pool area was shady and our lanai was huge with a wonderful view. Our two-bedroom was old with faded carpet, wallpaper  paint. It had seen better days and the upholstery was pretty threadbare. Even though bugs don't bother me in the least, I must admit I was a bit unerved when I saw a couple of cockroaches crawl behind the desk, so be warned. If you want a two bedroom, make sure that you ask for the room that isn't wheelchair accessible - the shower is a pull in shower and when you turn the water on, it tends to flow all over the bathroom - yuck. The hotel was very accomodating when we asked to change rooms and we moved into a gorgeous 1 bedroom with a pull-out couch on the 10th floor with in-room internet access and two tv's - one in the bedroom and 1 in the livingroom. A lovely Jacuzzi bathtub and high-end stereo system in the livingroom was such a delightful surprise! This suite was newer and updated - it felt much cleaner than our original two bedroom (and no critters that I could see) I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who's on a budget!p.s. the bathrooms downstairs in the main lobby are renovated and now operational","Jan 10, 2006","24","18",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_7789","Just What We Were Looking For! Just arrived home from Honolulu after a 9 night stay at the Ilima. We were a little nervous about our choice after reading a couple of recent reviews. We absolutely found nothing to complain about. The hotel was very comfortable, quiet (even during Christmas and New Year's) and a very friendly staff. My husband, 11 year old son and I stayed in a deluxe studio on the 15th floor. The room was very spacious with a king size bed and a full size. The kitchen was small, but adequate for a quick breakfast and soft drinks. The air conditioner worked great. It did not cycle on and off which is great. The maid was always early and never forgot to leave us what we needed. There was ample storage space. The balcony overlooking the canal and mountains was very nice. We parked every night in the free lot. Only once was it full and Jade a front desk clerk moved a sign so we could park for free. A small car definitely is better because the parking spots are small all over Waikiki. The Ilima is located right in the middle of Waikiki a few easy blocks from the beach. We were able to walk to many dinner destinations easily. The International Marketplace is just a hop away. If you want a quiet, comfortable reasonably priced place to stay the Ilima is great. It is not a luxury resort, but is a fine place to call home base during a visit to Oahu.","Jan 3, 2006","19","13",6,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_8449","Good Value and Location Spent 3 nights ($110 per night) at the Ilima in Dec 2005. Very happy with the proximity to Waikiki Beach and the surrounding designer boutiques (Gucci, Chanel, Prada, etc.) and restaurants. This is not a 4 or 5 star establishment, but that is OK, since you are not paying prime $$$. The rooms are outdated, but clean, comfortable, and roomy. We found the staff to be friendly.

"hotel_173","hotel_7763","Jekyll and Hyde?? I can't believe the last review was for virtually the same time my wife and I stayed at the Ilima. We arrived at about 5 p.m. on a Wednesday, surviving the rental car trip from the airport. The rush hour traffic, bumper-to-bumper most of the way, and the Waikiki area streets (apparently random) were the worst part of our stay. The restrooms on the ground floor were unavailable because of renovation work being done, but outside of that there was absolutely no problem.The ninth floor room overlooked the mountains and golf course and the view was stunning. The room (condo type with cooking facilities) was clean, well-stocked with utensils, quiet and the bathroom was clean and linen changes were quite appropriate. The desk staff were courteous and helpful when asked questions. We ate out at nearby Chinese and Thai restaurants (ok values) and ate in schlepping from the nearby Food Pantry (not Walmart prices). Our experience was quite the opposite of the other recent review; we were quite happy. My biggest regret is that I wasn't aware when renting from Enterprise at the airport that an intown rental was available about 200 feet away. It would have been cheaper to rent for only two days rather than four, using a shuttle to and from the airport.If we were to return we definitely would stay again!","Dec 26, 2005","13","8",6,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_8096","Very good value for money! We stayed at the Ilima from 12/3-12/8. We were on the 9th floor and had a great view of the canal, park, and mountains. The rooms are VERY big and include a kitchen area. The rooms are older/dated, but our room and my girlfriend's parents' room were very clean. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. They gave us directions and maps every day. Waikiki Beach is about 3 blocks away. Ask at the front desk for towels and straw mats (no charge) to take to the beach. I think that we paid $101 for the parents' room on the 5th floor. They had the same view that we did, but a little bit obstructed by the neighboring buildings. Our room was $110/night (prices listed are before taxes). The Ilima has free parking. The other hotels we were considering charged from $15 to $20/day. The buses that take people to the docking area for the dinner cruises has a pick up point at the Trade Center just a block away, very convenient! If you don't bring your own computer, you will have to use an internet cafe to check your email, etc. There is one around the block next to the Mexican restaurant, La Cucharacha. The pool is very small, but we had no interest in using a swimming pool, regardless of size.My biggest complaint was the bathroom light switch. The noisy bathroom fan is connected to the light switch. I hate it when there is not a separate switch for the fan. Also room cooling is from an in the wall a/c unit. The units were brand new, but they are still a little noisy. If you like Chinese food at a real hole in the wall kind of place, try Fattys around the corner.Remember the Ilima is NOT the Four Seasons... But if you like good value for money, this place is a deal. I adored the place and when we moved on to Maui, it was a big come down moving into a regular sized hotel room.

"hotel_173","hotel_9922","a gem in busy Waikiki After doing much research on where to stay on Oahu and not spend $200 a night, we were very pleased with the Ilima. We booked through their website and paid $110 a night for a deluxe studio. These are huge rooms with full kitchens! We asked for a mountain view and were on the 14th floor looking right out onto the Ala Wai canal and the golf course with the mountains in the background. We enjoyed sitting out on the lanai. This is not a fancy hotel but was very clean and worked quite well for what we wanted. As mentioned by others, the staff was all very friendly and really made us feel very welcome. We did go to the store and buy some basic groceries.  The location was very handy for walking into Waikiki, it was a couple of blocks to the beach. The Ilima will loan you towels and beach mats. My husband loves his Starbuck's and there are two within a block. Parking is free in the hotel garage which is a great perk for the Waikiki area. We rented a midsize and my husband was able to fit the car into the small spots. I could not have done it and didn't try! We got back to the hotel at 8pm one night and got the last spot. There is overflow parking across the street for $14 a night. Parking on the street is very limited.We both said that we would stay at the Ilima again.

"hotel_173","hotel_8401","Ideal family hotel We were delighted with the Ilima, during our 2 day stay 20/21 Sept 2005. The roomy 2 bedroom suite (Rm 503, 5th floor with balcony overlooking the street) allowed my wife and I and our 4 boys to spread out and relax. Decor might not be Vogue but it was very clean and well maintained, and after all, we were just looking for a comfortable place to crash after shopping and sightseeing. The heated pool was a great bonus after the beach got too crowded or windy. Many of the guests were Kiwis and Aussies, like us, enjoying the school holidays - you can pick them at the beach, they're the only ones wearing rashies (rash guards) and headgear.The Ilima staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and professional - we turned up too early to check in but they held onto our gear whilst we walked to the markets 80m away, and then slotted us in 2 hours early, which was much appreciated after the long trip from Perth, Western Australia. There are many restuarants, ranging from cheaps eats to expensive within easy walking distance, as are the shops and beaches that make Waikiki famous. We looked at hiring a car but $2 per person on the trolley bus (catch it at the bus stop in front of the statue of The Duke on the main road - that's the Hawaiian surfer, not John Wayne) gets you the huge Ala Moana shopping centre 10 minutes away. The front office staff were very helpful with ideas for day trips, local entertainment and so on.We'd cheerfully return to the Ilima for an extended stay - great value for money, close to the action, friendly staff, clean and spacious - but yes, as mentioned on a previous post, beware if you have little ones, the balcony railings are quite wide.Incidentally, after checking out the reviews and internet rates on the Tripadvisor site prior to the trip, we rang the hotel and actually got a better rate (US$175 per night, including taxes) so that may be worth trying, plus one can detail specific requests ; wheelchair access etc.","Oct 10, 2005","30","21",6,5,1,5,1,6,1,"4","$157"

We didn't use all of the kitchen facilities, but the fridge and coffee maker were nice to have.

"hotel_173","hotel_8455","Spacious, cheap, and conveniently located For the price, the Ilima is an excellent hotel. I paid $110 a night (internet special on the hotel's own website, which was still running the date of this review) for the deluxe studio in room 1107, which had a nice view of the mountains and golf course (there are no beach view rooms at the Ilima). However, it is certainly not a luxury resort. If you want the resort experience, skip the Ilima and spend the extra money. Even better, stay on another Island, like Kuai or Maui. If, on the other hand, you plan on being busy hiking, shopping, fine dining, and touring the island, I definitely recommend saving the money for your activities and staying at the Ilima. It's centrally located (lots of resaurants, bars, and clubs nearby), has VERY spacious, clean rooms with lots of storage space, and offers free parking. We heard that the lot fills up at night, but we came back to the hotel between 6:00 and 8:00 every night and had no problem getting a space. I stayed for 8 days with my boyfriend, and it was really nice to have the space (530 square feet) to unpack everything, and to comfortably lounge around the room when we were feeling lazy.Even though we didn't cook anything, having the kitchen was great for stocking beverages and reheating leftovers.The pool definitely sucks, and the gym is a joke, but I wasn't planning on spending any time at them anyway. I'm racking my brain, and I really can't think of anything else negative to say. The Ilima is a top-notch budget hotel.","Aug 20, 2005","26","17",6,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_7007","Good location, nice hotel, helpful staff...pity about the pool My wife and I stayed 12 days in Room 901. It was a very large studio, overlooking the Ala Wai Canal and Golf Course, with the Mountains in the distance. There is a good sized Lanai which gets morning sun.The well equipped room comes with a full kitchen including full sized modern frig, microwave, and stove/oven. Lots of storage for suitcases and as many hangers in the closet as we wanted. There is daily maid service.The free phone (local and 1-800 calls) and access to phone books was handy, as was the free daily newspaper.Although we were right alongside the elevator, the room is well soundproofed, so we heard little noise from the elevator or its lobby.The air conditioning worked well and quietly. We kept it running on low, 24 hours. It was not a bother at night, and we heard no street noise... only the odd ambulance siren.Good Tip... use small pieces of duct tape to seal the heavy lightproof curtains together each night. The sun rises before 6am, and the tape keeps out the narrow, bright sunbeams that can otherwise shine in through the gaps and wake a sleeper too early!The hotel has a sundeck on the roof (16th floor) and on the 10th. These provide for sunbathing anytime you like. There are lounger chairs.The pool was our big disappointment. It is small, and located behind the hotel on the ground floor. It has little deck around it, and is in shade much of the day. The high buildings around it create a wind-tunnel effect, so without sun it is quite cold and unpleasant.There are lots of good eating places close by, and of these we most enjoyed the newish Legend Chinese Restaurant just up the street on Kuhio. Reasonable price and very good food.The beach is only about three blocks away but when we were there that part (in front of Royal Hawaiian etc) was very crowded. We went instead a short bus ride to the beach alongside the Army Museum, near the Hale Koa Hotel.

There is an on site 3 level garage, but the parking spaces and are small and limited and you need to be back at the hotel around early evening or else you will need to find a spot at other properties for 12-14$ a day.The property needs a makeover. For example, all the windows are louvered with no sound insulation whatsoever. Consequently, the street noises are heard very clearly. The airconditioning unit from the floor above had no water pan and dripped on our unit everyday and night. The phone in the kitchen was one step up from a dial phone with the face plate falling off. There is no lighting ambience anywhere in the rooms since the main kitchen and room lights are old (70's) fluoresent tubes/fixtures. The 17 inchTV is probably 15 years old. As other posters have stated, for the money, it isn't that bad a deal, but...it is not for everyone. AAA rating- 2 stars.","Aug 12, 2005","29","26",6,3,1,4,1,4,1,"4","$157"

"hotel_173","hotel_2862","Absolutely Loved it My fiancee' and I stayed there from June 24-29, and we also stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village 29 - July 4th. We wanted to split our trip so we could enjoy driving the island and exploring while staying at the Ilima and enjoying the beach and Hilton property during the latter part of our trip. In fact, I proposed to gf the first night we were there. I did the deed at La Mer so be sure to read my review. We absolutely loved the Ilima b/c its centrally located in Waikiki. We had a Superior room on the 14th floor overlooking the canal, golf course, and mountains. The room was big and clean. Yes, it was sparsely decorated but it was everything that we needed. I like the kitchen which afforded us to make breakfast and prepare two dinners. Oh yeah, let me not forget the free high speed intenet connection and free parking; we kept family and friends informed with the daily pictures and emails. We didn't have any problems with parking b/c we made sure that we made it back to the hotel by 5pm everyday. I really like the free stuff b/c you get nickeled and dimed at other properties in Waikiki. We would definitely stay there again.Even though the Ilima and the Hilton are in two different classes of hotels, they are both awesome in their own rights.","Jul 11, 2005","30","21",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$157"

"hotel_173","hotel_6207","Deluxe not so deluxe We stayed in what was called a deluxe one bedroom with living room and kitchen on the 15th floor. I believe our room was 1506. The staff was great, and the lobby and pool area very nice, clean and stylish. But the condo was drab and uninviting. Very few pictures on the walls, and what there were looked like cheap abstract prints. No lovely tropical touches like I've seen in all the other places I've stayed in Hawaii. There was a huge shelved unit housing the TV in the living room, but every shelf was empty. The plastic curtain liners were stained with rust. The rooms were clean but very dated and depressing. Free ethernet access was a plus, but it died on the last day we were there. The first day, we had no cable in the living room, but it worked in the bedroom. I went to the desk to see about getting it fixed and they told me there was no cable in the living rooms because someone had complained about their children watching HBO (nudity etc) ???? I found this hard to believe, but they did reverse the TVs so that we had cable in the LR but not the bedroom. They should not advertise cable TV if they don't have it. Very odd. The kitchen appliances were clean but seemed not to have been updated since at least the 70's. The lanai furniture was cheap and unattractive.My main complaint was with the lack of decor of any type. I'm an artist and appreciate visual stimulation, and there was none, not even a vase of artificial flowers!The kitchen was sparsely equipped. Four of each for silverware, plates, etc. No wine glasses, no corkscrew or even a bottle opener.

"hotel_173","hotel_3927","Great location, great rooms! We stayed for 9 nights at the Ilima Hotel in beautiful Waikiki and we could not have been more pleased with our accommodations! This is not one of those pretentious, expensive hotels right on the beach鈥攊t is just a comfortable, clean, friendly and quiet hotel that is within easy walking distance to all that Waikiki has to offer. We opted for the 1 bedroom unit, which included a living room with pull out queen sofa bed, a full kitchen, a bathroom with Jacuzzi tub, and a good sized bedroom with a king bed. The room we stayed in (508) faced away from the street, so it was surprisingly quiet. We also ran the two air conditioners in the unit pretty much constantly, which drowned out any noise. From the lanai, we could look to the right toward the beach (but note that there is no view of the water from any of the rooms. However, you can go up to the hotel roof and see a little ocean) or to the left at the Ala Wai Canal and the mountains.As far as location, the Ilima鈥檚 is excellent! The hotel is just off busy Kuhio Avenue and immediately adjacent to Duke鈥檚 Lane and the International Market Place. Walk down Duke鈥檚 Lane, cross Kalakaua Avenue, jog a little to the left, and there you are at the public beach access to world-famous Waikiki Beach (about a 5 minute walk). You are also a short walk away from numerous shopping centers, the beautiful Kuhio Park, and other well known hotels such as the Outrigger Waikiki, Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton Waikiki, and Halekulani.There is a medium-sized grocery store 2 blocks away on Kuhio Ave (Foodland), a pharmacy about 1 block away, and numerous restaurants and fast food places in every direction. One word of advice: bring traveler鈥檚 checks or cash with you. A surprising number of places are reluctant to take credit cards, and virtually no one takes debit cards (i.e., no option to get cash back). Consequently, we made many trips to the ATM for cash, and got slammed with fees every time!My only two complaints about the Ilima are the king bed and the parking. Although the king mattress was a Serta Perfect Sleeper, it was very hard and uncomfortable. I generally like firm mattresses, but this one did not give at all and resulted in some pretty significant hip pain for me off and on during our stay. Perhaps the mattresses in other rooms are better, though. And despite what other reviewers said, we did have trouble finding parking a few times and parking spots are really tight. Even with those two concerns, I would highly recommend the Ilima and would stay there again in a heartbeat!","Apr 25, 2005","29","23",6,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_8434","Highly recommend We just returned from a one week stay at the Ilima. We couldn't have been more pleased! The location is terrific - basically away from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to take advantage of everything that is Waikiki. There are many restaurants and shops within walking distance. The people at the front desk were wonderful - providing lots of tips and recommendations. We stayed in a 7th floor studio unit, facing the mountain. We didn't experience any noise problems, and the view from the lanai was incredible. Virtually every morning there was a rainbow in the mist on the mountain. The room was huge, with all the amenities one could ask for. When the air conditioning unit in our room quit working it was promptly replaced with a brand new one. It was great having a full kitchen, although we didn't use the stove. The shelf for toiletries in the bathroom is small, but there is a closet with shelves just outside the bathroom door to keep larger things in. The parking garage is tight, but we never had a problem. What a bonus - there aren't many places in Honolulu where parking is free. Our only complaint (minor) is that the small heated pool was too warm! All in all, a wonderful place to stay! We highly recommend it and would return to the Ilima in a heartbeat.","Mar 20, 2005","29","24",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_10083","Ten great nights at the Ilima Hotel We just got back from spending ten nights at the Ilima Hotel. We had a studio deluxe unit facing Waikiki. The view was of surrounding buildings and streets. We could see the ocean between the buildings. The lanai was pretty large, with enough room for two chairs and a small table. But ours faced the ocean, so it got really hot in the afternoon. Our room was very clean and the maid service was great. The location can't be beat. It's a short walk to the beach, and there are lots of great restaurants nearby. Even the big park is close enough to walk to.Our room featured the typical rattan/tropical decor and everything was in good condition. The kitchen includes a toaster, tiny coffee maker, microwave, dishes for 4, a few pots and pans, some utensils. We took our own wine opener, but I think there was one in the room. We also took coffee filters and a few zip-lock sandwich bags so we wouldn't have to purchase them. We didn't use the stove at all, but I assume it worked fine. The fridge was spotless and had full ice cube trays and a full pitcher of cold water when we arrived. The fridge worked OK, but leaked water periodically (I guess when the freezer defrosts), which ran down the inside of the back of the fridge, under the crisper drawer, and eventually leaked out onto the floor. I just put a folded dish cloth inside the door to catch the water. I'm sure if I had told them about it they would have fixed it.The room also had a small desk, a large dresser, nightstands, clock radio, and two large closets. They provide a laundry basket too, so you can carry your laundry to the coin-op machines on the third floor. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower combo, tile floor, hairdryer, and a metal shelf above the sink and toilet for toiletries. The shelf was just barely big enough for our stuff (make sure you keep the toilet lid down in case your things slide off the shelf!).Because the Ilima is in a city environment, there is a lot of noise. We didn't sleep well the first night because of people shouting on the street, sirens, and garbage pick-up at dawn. I'm a very light sleeper, so I also heard the elevator beeping, as it was right outside our door. The rest of our stay we left the air conditioner on the fan setting all night to drown out the noise. It worked great, and I slept better at the Ilima than I have in any other hotel. The bed was very comfortable (one king and one full size in our studio), and they provide extra pillows and blankets. There was absolutely no noise from other rooms, except for the occasional door slamming. We rented a car so we could explore the island, but you don't really need one. If you do rent a car, get a small compact, as the parking garage is very tight. Even though the hotel was completely full during our stay, we always found a parking space. But we never came back late at night either because we always walked to dinner. I suppose you may have to park across the street if you come back late.We paid a AAA rate of $123 for our studio deluxe room on the 12th floor. Considering that includes Internet access, a daily local newspaper, local phone calls, parking, and a great location, the Ilima Hotel is an excellent value. I would definitely stay there again.","Mar 3, 2005","35","29",6,5,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_4996","Ilima is great! We stayed in a deluxe 1 bedroom at the Ilima in early December. We have 2 teenagers and had plenty of room to spread out. The staff is friendly, concerned and efficient. The suite was clean and well furnished. The location is excellent-a few minutes' walk to the Royal Hawaiian on Waikiki. We paid about 140.00/nt (internet rate from Ilima website)for the large bedroom, living room and kitchen (plus a jacuzzi bathtub). The room had free internet access as well. I would rather save the 100.00+++ a night more it would have cost to stay in a beachfront hotel room and have a little walk to the beach. This is not for you if you require a luxury, full-service resort. But if you would rather save that extra cash for helicopter rides and surfing lessons, this may be just the place for you!","Jan 26, 2005","24","19",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$157"
"hotel_173","hotel_6648","Great Bargin in Waikiki - Nice Hotel The Ilima hotel was a very nice place to stay in Waikiki. Compared to the Hyatt - it is only minimal and average, so if you have $300 a night to blow go to the Hyatt or Marriott. If you are looking for a great bargin and a nice place to stay, this is the hotel for you. The hotel does not offer much as far as extras - but their friendly helpful attitude and clean, large spacious rooms are great. They have a pool, though it is very small, but when in Waikiki who wants to swim in a pool? Our room was 909, a corner overlooking the mountains and canal and was super. We had our own fridge, oven, mircrowave, coffee pot and basic kitchen dishes and such. We used these a few times and found the fridge especially handy for water and drinks. The room was cleaned daily and I didn't think twice about sleeping in the bed or using the bathroom (and I can be kind of picky). The carpet could have used a cleaning (not too bad though, I still didn't mind walking arouind in bare feet) and the furniture and decor was a bit dated. For the price though it was a bargin. We used their internet special and paid only $95 per night, and our 5th night was free! Try and beat that in Waikiki, even higher rated hotels that cost more can't compare to the quality for the price paid.We found the location very good with many things close. It is off the main strip so it was quiet (a big complaint for many other hotels in the area) and we were not disturbed by traffic or other noise. It is still centrally located enough though that we could walk to everything. The Int'l Market Place is only a block away and the beach is just past that. We could walk to either end of the strip and not be wore out by the time we got there.They also are great about accomidating you for late departures/early arrivals. We were not flying out until 9pm, so they held our luggage for us (securely) and we had the whole day to shop, eat lunch and everything before we left.I would stay here again in a minute and recommend it to all the cost minded people out there that realize $300 a night is crazy for a place you only spend your time sleeping in.","Nov 29, 2004","30","24",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$157"

"hotel_173","hotel_3473","Great value, very good hotel! Stayed at the Ilima for a week in Oct. 2004. Walked-in without reservations but had done research and knew the Ilima had received rave reviews. Front desk person was extremely nice and let us preview the rooms before we committed. The hotel was only about 3/4 full this time of the year. We were happy with what we saw, and booked a corner studio unit on the 11th flr with a great view of the mountains, Ala Wai Canal and golfcourse for a great AAA rate of $105. All the studios face the mountain side; the 1 and 2-bdrm units have a more city view. The unit was indeed comfortable and very spacious with a kitchenette (full fridge, electric stove, sink, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, utensils and dishware/cutlery), king bed, full bed and a very spacious lanai. The bathroom was basic, but modern and clean. The hotel is on a quiet street, only about 2-3 blocks from Waikiki beach. The free parking is a real rarity in Waikiki, and a great deal. It is however, limited so there's no guarantee, especially if they're full and in high season...in which case you might have to pay $10 for parking across the street. However, throughout our stay, we never had a problem and always found a space. The Iliima also offers free local calls and free high-speed internet access.The bed was comfortable and everything was in good working order. We were very pleased overall with the value for our money and we would not only recommend this hotel, but stay again. However, a few minor things I'd like to point out, although these should not be construed as criticisms. Firstly, the pool is small and there's no workout facility if this is important to you. Secondly, the hotel is condominium-like so while there is daily maid service, don't expect room service or anything fancy. They clean daily and leave a paper at your door. Anything further, you shouldn't expect. There is a full-service tour desk in the lobby. The front desk staff is very friendly but unobtrusive. We rarely ran into other guests during our stay, and heard nothing from neighboring units, which, if like us you value your privacy and freedom, is great! Their laundry facility is really convenient (they have 4 coin-operated washers/dryers, all very reasonable) and it was almost always empty. They also offer free beach towels and bamboo mats in the lobby. A few very minor comments, and by mention I don't intend that they should be taken as deterrants if you're considering a stay. It would be nice if they could provided more, and bigger and thicker bath towels. The ones we got (2) were lower-end motel quality. It would be great if they provided free daily coffee packets. We got one complimentary pack on our first day, then had to go out and buy coffee filters and ground coffee for the rest of our stay. A small thing, but not insignificant. We were provided dishwashing liquid, but no sponge to do our dishwashing. A corkscrew would've been nice. We ended up having to make-shift wrestle with a can opener to even pry open a bottle of beer. Again, small gestures, but just something we would've appreciated having. The shower pressure was decent, but the shower head sprayed all over in a fine mist. They should consider purchasing better showerheads. I think this is important to guests that have to shower there everyday for numerous days. Also, there's insufficient counterspace for toiletries in the bathroom (a narrow strip of stainless steel over the sink).Lastly, while many on this site have raved about housekeeping, I'm sorry to say that I only personally observed an adequate level of service on this point. We found that on multiple days in a row, housekeeping did not perform anything but basic restocking in our room. We noticed that bathroom mirrors and counters/sinks were very obviously not cleaned nor wiped down, despite having left generous tips to housekeeping. I was a bit disappointed since we stayed at the Ilima duiring International Housekeeping Week where they were supposedly going the extra mile. I'm not a picky traveler, but there are basic services to expect. While adequate, I cannot agree that housekeeping cleaned to a very high standard. Aside from this, our overall experience at the Ilima was extremely good, and I would have no qualms about recommending it to the next value-minded traveler. The Iliima offers unbeatable honest great value compared to other moderate hotels in Waikiki. Even if they didn't fix any of the things I mentioned, I would still stay there again.","Oct 21, 2004","34","28",6,5,1,4,1,5,1,"4","$157"

The only drawback at this time (which has nothing to do with the hotel) is the main street (Kuhio Street)leading to the hotel in under heavy construction, therefore it is practically traffic jam around the clock.

"hotel_187","hotel_10001","impeccable service I wasn't sure what to think when we bid on priceline a name your own price for downtown/convention center for a 4 star hotel. Most of the reviews seemed good but reading some posts on the forum recommended other hotels when Riverfront Wyndham was brought up but we got an amazing rate. We hoped for the best and the best is what we got. I was the first to arrive in New Orleans and was at the hotel by 10:30 am.I was immediately greeted by friendly attendant who helped with my luggage. I was prepared to drop off my bags and check in later but they were happy to let me check in early and they made sure had everything I needed. Some people have complained when they've booked with Priceline that they get the worst room in the hotel but that was not the case. The room was immaculate, spacious and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small but fine. That evening, we had appetizers at 7 on Fulton the restaurant within the hotel and once again the staff gave superb service. I eat seafood but not meat and they offered to prepare a dish specially for me and it was wonderful. I have to be honest another concern was location. I typically like to stay in the quarter right in the middle of everything but better deals were available in the downtown/convention center area so we decided to try it. The location was fine. While not right in the middle of everything it was close to attractions such as the aquarium, riverwalk mall, restaurants such as Mother's and Mulates and more. It was only a 10 minute walk into the quarter and right by Harrahs. During the day we'd typically walk to the quarter and in the evenings after going out we'd take a Taxi back. Everytime we walked through the front lobby we were greeted and the staff cheerfully answered any questions and helped whenever needed. Although I think I still prefer staying in the middle of the quarter I would not hestitate to stay here again or to recommend this hotel because the service was some of the best I've received from a hotel in New Orleans and because of the comfort of the room.","Jan 8, 2009","1","1",6,6,5,6,6,6,1,"4.5","$300"

Despite not much of a lobby, the room was gorgeous, and clearly just renovated--everything was immaculate. This room was in the old section, and managed to be both historic and sleek. Huge too, could have bowled in there. Beds are great, particularly the duvets, and bathrooms are quite functional and bright. One wall of the room had exposed brick and plantation shutters.Fitness center is limited but free.Location wasn't bad--a few blocks in back of Harrah's casino, and a block from the kind of depressing Riverwalk mall as well as the convention center--but the heart of the French Quarter was about 30 minutes' walk.No pool--a drawback in often-hot and sticky New Orleans.Staff was quite friendly and helpful--kudos on that score.Priceline gave this a 4 star rating--probably a bit overstated--but at $61 a night, what a value!If this is what Wyndham has become, good deal--this hotel is a credit to their brand.","Oct 30, 2008","1","1",5,5,4,5,5,5,5,"4.5","$300"

It is within walking distance of almost everything. The rooms are big (except the bathrooms). The beds are VERY comfortable and the hotel is quiet. We had breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. We stayed 6 nights and would go back if we visit New Orleans again. We stay in many hotels during the year for leisure travel.

If you are coming to New Orleans and you will be at the Convention Center, this is the best hotel to stay at. It was 4 of us in one room and we were very comfortable.

"hotel_187","hotel_6016","Nice hotel This is a beautiful, classy hotel with polite staff and clean, upscale rooms. It is very convenient to Harrah's and the Convention Center, but it is a little walk to the French Quarter. If you don't like to walk, take a cab to the Quarter. Despite its name, it does not have a great view of the river, and not much is happening at the Riverwalk mall anyway since Katrina. I was a little concerned about the safety of walking from the Quarter to the hotel at night (I'm a former N.O. resident and am very familiar with downtown) but it was fine. Just walk from the Quarter to Harrah's, then to the Harrah's parking lot, then to the hotel in the next block. Hotel parking was $32 a night, so we played for 30 minutes at Harrah's and got 24 hours of parking for free.","Jul 6, 2008","1","1",6,6,4,6,6,6,6,"4.5","$300"
"hotel_187","hotel_7716","Conference/Vacation stay We were in New Orleans for a conference and some vacation time. We stayed at the Wyndham for 7 nights. There were 3 of us and each one had a different type of room. It was a wonderful stay. I had a historical king. Great room-large enough but very cozy. The bed was prefect and the towels were big and fluffy. The room furniture was in good shape-well appointed. My request for a refrig was granted due to medical needs-no charge (would have cost $15.00 a day if not for medical). The air system worked great-it was in the upper 90's some days. One of the other guests had a corner king (huge room) and the other had a double queen, also a huge room. The staff was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I can't say enough about the housekeeping gal-she was great-all requests were met. After a couple of days it really felt like home. The desk staff and the bell staff were great also. I would not think twice about staying there again!The hotel is 1 block from the convention center, 2 blocks from Harahs, 1 block to the trolley stop at Riverwalk, and only a short walk into the French Quarter. It felt safe most of the time but there are still a lot of buildings that are not open when you walk away from the major areas.","Jul 5, 2008","1","1",5,5,5,5,6,5,1,"4.5","$300"

The bathroom was small but fully stocked of towels and toiletries.The Wyndham is about 15 min walk to the French Quarter but there are well lit streets to walk along or there is a tram stop near the casino.

The only things keeping me from giving this hotel a 5-star rating were: Rough and thin towels; a charge for local calls; charge for internet access; and limited television stations.

"hotel_187","hotel_2445","Nice hotel a bit far from main tourist attaractions Just spend four nights at this property. This is my fourth time in New Orleans and first time post-Katrina and with family. We booked by calling the property directly as we needed two rooms and they were running a second room 1/2 off special. The rooms were nicely decorated. The beds had nice and confomfortable linens. The bathrooms are small at this property. The concierge was very nice and friendly. The only thing I think may need improvement is to have the water and coffee supplies replenished each night by housekeeping. However, be aware that parking is 28 per day, plus tax. We spent most of our time walking to the French Quarter for meals, sightseeing, and shopping. However, there is a nice Cajun restaurant and brewery in walking distance. Overall, very nice property. However, I would not stay here again with children. The crime rate in New Orleans is high and I would eliminate walking long distances after dark with shopping bags and kids (obvious tourists)! I do think that common sense prevails, stay in well lit areas and never talk to strangers. I did see the scam ltaking place around the Natchez that is listed in posts here regarding, Where are you shoes? The scam artists actually said they were part of the Natches (riverboat) crew but they obviously were not. Be careful of stuff like that and you will be fine.","Mar 28, 2008","4","3",5,6,3,6,6,5,2,"4.5","$300"
"hotel_187","hotel_10012","Somewhat Deceiving On our way back to Texas after traveling to Biloxi Ms to see our son in the Air Force, we decided we would give New Orleans a try after having not been there in about 15 years. I studied all of the reviews in Trip Advisor and chose the Wyndham somewhat due to having Riverfront in the name. I visualized relaxing in my room while watching activities on the river. When I booked the room, I even told them I wanted a room with a river view. The young lady told me they were completely booked but could give me a Superior King Corner for just a little more and I booked it. When we got to the hotel at around noon and were told that the check in time was not until 3:00, which was ok with us since we were going to go walk in the French Quarter anyway. They asked for my cell number so they could call me when the room was ready. I never got a call and we went back to the hotel assuming they just forgot and found out all of the Superior King Corners were still not ready and they suggested one of our normal rooms on the sixth floor with a great big window and the best view of the River. We were tired and accepted. We got to the room and looked out the window and discovered that we looked out over a parking lot (about a 400 car lot) and on the other side of that was the railroad tracks and then the River Front Mall. The only view of the river was a very small peek through a breezeway of the mall. The hotel is only 6 stories tall and so is the mall. In short, if you are wanting a view of the river....it does not happen at the Wyndham Riverfront. Oh and by the way, when I got my bill it was for the Superior King Corner. If you are not looking for a view, it is actually a nice hotel with very comfortable beds and is very clean.","Mar 21, 2008","3","3",4,5,3,5,4,4,5,"4.5","$300"
"hotel_187","hotel_3117","Fantastic Stay My wife and I just recently stayed at the Wyndham Riverfront in New Orleans and had a great experience. Overall, this is based on our experience with ALL the staff at the Hotel. They provided some of the best, personalized service and attention that we have received. From the doormen, front desk, reception, room service, etc, everyone was friendly and very attentive.When we asked for a room change after arriving, we were upgraded and received a suite (we are Wyndham by Request members).We ordered in breakfast on several occasions and the food and the service was very good.I would recommend the hotel for its location as well. It is near the river in a very clean area close to shopping, the French Quarter, and the casino. We had originally thought we would stay in the French Quarter, but after having gone there, we felt we had made an excellent choice. You're close enough to walk but you are able to get away to a quieter area of New Orleans.By the way, take some of the tours while you are there -- we can recommend the plantation and city tours of the Garden District, French Quarter, and Katrina areas. They truly give you a feel of this area and the information provided (especially about the Katrina impacted areas) is truly impactful.","Mar 21, 2008","2","2",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4.5","$300"

About 2 or 3 blocks down the street from the hotel we found a good covered parking lot to leave our car for 13 days for $120 total. The lots name is Ampco System Parking and they shuttled us to and from the cruise port for free and the best part was they were wating for us after both cruises just outside where we cleared coustoms.","Jan 8, 2008","0","0",6,6,5,6,6,6,1,"4.5","$300"
"hotel_187","hotel_5708","Great location Checked in on 12/31/07 and out on 1/2/08. We were in town for the Sugar Bowl and decided to stay outside of the French Quarter to avoid some of the craziness of New Year's Eve. Check in was quick and easy. Help with luggage was great and efficient. The hotel is only 6 stories but has a lot of rooms on long corridors. If you don't want to walk a long way, ask for a room close to the elevators. But ice and vending are at the end of the long winding corridor.Beds were very comfortable and the room was clean with nice amenities including coffee and coffee maker. The do not disturb signs are flimsey and tend to fall off of the door handle. Ours disappeared and the maid was knocking on our door too early in the morning on January 1. She graciously left when asked. The housekeeping staff was very pleasant and did a wonderful job.The walls between rooms seem to be a little thin. From 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. we had a crying baby next door. We didn't use room service and didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant. On New Year's Eve it was closed for a private party.The hotel is very close to the Convention Center and the River Walk. Also close to Harrah's Casino if you're up for a little gambling. It is a hike to the French Quarter but you can walk it or easily get a taxi or take very inexpensive public transportation. Felt safe in this area.Close to the Bon Ton Cafe and Mother's restaurants. Both are excellent! Be prepared to wait in a line outside to eat at Mother's -they don't take reservations. Overall I would recommend the hotel. We used Orbitz to book and therefore didn't get our Wyndham by Request amenities. Learned we need to book directly with Wyndham.","Jan 4, 2008","2","2",5,6,6,6,6,6,5,"4.5","$300"

First let me say everyone told me to make sure I stayed in the french quarters, how wrong they were.The quarters is filled with people and hotel on top of hotel its a great place to visit,shop and eat but when it came time to rest it did not get any better than the Wyndham Riverfront. It sits across the street from the riverfront and streetcars that that takes you everywhere for $1.25 and .40 cents for seniors. The hotel is only six stories high it sits in warehouse district up and trendy where you find galleries and great local places to eat and listen to some great New Orleans music. When I searched the websites looking at hotels I found lots with that old New Orleans feel but that wasnt what we wanted. We wnted something contemporary and new with clean lines. When I saw the picture of white down comforters I knew I had found it and I was right. The hotel was modern clean and very comfortable.The staff was wonderful from doormen,room service, dry cleaning ,maid service and setting up our return flight. I found out while there they had two story rooms that that are very ice and very reasonable priced.

"hotel_187","hotel_3023","AAO meeting across the street If you have business at the New Orleans Convention Center, this is the place to stay. A short two minute walk will get you there and it's only about 10 minutes to the French Quarter.New Orleans is trying very hard to present its best face to visitors and it's working. The area around the Convention Center is spotless. I couldn't find a piece of trash on any street. The trees were freshly planted and everything looked fresh. I heard all the homeless now live in Houston and would have to believe that. The streets were filled with only tourists or business people. The hotel informed me they were over-booked when I checked in about 6 p.m. and they would therefore give me only smoking rooms. Since the town was full for the convention, I had no other choice. Try as best I could, the room never lost that stench from smoking and my clothes still reek of it as they hang in my closet at home. Oh well.Otherwise, the staff were very friendly and helpful. I ate several times at the downstairs restaurant and enjoyed quick service, good food and reasonable prices.My maid seemed to have a few problems though, as I often found a lack of hand towels, new shampoo or new soaps upon returning to the room. A call to the front desk fixed all this, but it was a bit of a pain. How much can a new shampoo cost them?The connecting door between my room and the next seemed quite thin. Unfortunately, my neighbor liked to leave his TV on all night to help him ?sleep? and I had to call the front desk one night, as the volume was loud enough to keep me awake. They promptly visited his room and all was quiet for the rest of the evening though. The central location made is easy to wander around downtown at night. The area seemed very safe and well-lit. I would not hesitate to bring my family back to this hotel for vacation. I only hope they can keep the area as nice as it currently is.","Nov 18, 2007","1","1",5,5,6,5,3,5,1,"4.5","$300"

We came in to NOLA on a Saturday and stayed at a different hotel on the edge of the Quarter, I absolutely loved (see other review). After brunch on Sunday we checked into the Riverfront. I just remember that our room was quite a walk from the elevator up some stairs and down some stairs, however the front desk warned us. There were 3 of us. Husband, myself and 12 year old daughter. The room held 2 double beds. Needless to say, double beds don't cut it for my husband and me, but hey it was free I can't complain. What I can complain about is maid service. One day they were so late, we just decided to forego the maid service and the other days they came to clean around 2:30 to 3:00 p.m. even though we were gone, out of the hotel every morning. No refrigerators in room either. The front desk was very nice and the hotel is in proximity to a lot of different places.

It's not as fancy or as close to the casino, but having stayed at the new place, I can say I vastly prefer this one.The Riverfront is quiet, clean and has all the basic amenities you'd expect from a CBD-area hotel. Best of all, the staff can't be beat for service and friendliness; they are willing to go out of their way to be helpful, and aren't as tied to Harrah's slick corporate ethos as their counterparts at the Canal Street hotel. I also like staying here because you can roll out of bed, down the elevator, across a parking lot and into the Riverwalk Mall (recovering slowly but steadily from its post-Katrina malaise) for a beignet and coffee at its Cafe du Monde outpost. Ladies, there's also a nice nail salon on the lower level at Riverwalk if you need a polish touchup. You can get your toes done and look out the window at the ships going by - lotsa fun!The in-hotel restaurant, 7 on Fulton, is actually quite good and is getting a lot of buzz locally for its fine cuisine. We've eaten there a few times and have never been disappointed. It's not the fanciest game in town, but it's really, really good. They also do room service - excellent gumbo and salads. Yum!Some folks complain about the extra two-block walk to the casino (or Quarter, or wherever), but it'll give you a chance to help walk off those beignets and gumbo. C'mon, it's good for you!","Dec 25, 2006","2","2",6,5,5,5,6,6,5,"4.5","$300"

The only problem we encountered was the closest Harrahs garage was closed to the public, making parking very scarce unless you wanted to pay $28 a day for valet parking. We will definitely return to this property and will recommend it to anyone. Thanks for a nice week. Nov 12th thru 17th. The Scotts","Nov 19, 2006","1","1",6,6,5,6,6,6,1,"4.5","$300"
"hotel_187","hotel_1943","Modern excellent hotel The Riverfront is run by Harrah's now. They said they had a need for 100+ more rooms than the new Harrah's hotel down the street. They're tied together. You can charge to your room at the Harrahs or Harrah's Hotel restaurants (they even looked up a Riverfront Hotel room charge when I asked at the front desk of the Harrah's Hotel).This hotel is very modern, with room size that seemed fine to me. A wall was angled with big windows (views are generally parking lots across the street). Modern bathroom with nice under-counter bins for towels and hair dryer. Nice shower head.The beds are great with nice comforter. Extra pillow in the closet.There's a work desk with wired Internet (or use the TV internet with wireless keyboard that's in the desk drawer). It costs $10 from noon till noon. But I got a strong wireless connection from an access point named CityOfNewOrleans. I had free Internet my entire stay.The desk chair was great! The Aereon-type chair was very comfortable.USA Today was delivered in the morning. More TV channels than most (40+ channels with CNBC, HBO, ESPN 1  2). They had a tray of apples in the lobby in the afternoon.There's one nice cloth-tablecloth restaurant in the lobby area (not very busy). And limited room service menu 24 hrs a day. That may be why they aren't listed as 4 stars.The front desk was very helpful on more than one occasion. They even had Internet behind the desk and looked up a local store for me using Mapquest.They can check your Harrah's play for possible comp of room charges before you check out. And if you're a Harrahs regular it's likely you'll get free room coupons in the mail. Or check rates after log-in at [----].The room had no refrigerator or mini-bar. That's the only thing I would have really liked. It's not common in the other area hotels I stayed at.Its a couple long blocks to Harrah's. A shuttle runs every 15 mins until 3am.The new Harrah's hotel is closer if you want to avoid walking. Save $20/day parking by parking at Harrah's garage and walking (and load up on the 65c can drinks in the machines in the garage).A car may not be needed here. Take the airport shuttle.Enjoy!","Nov 6, 2006","3","3",6,6,5,6,6,6,6,"4.5","$300"

"hotel_189","hotel_4926","Fantastic Hotel All Around I usually stay at Hiltons when I travel for business because of the sheer number of them available; there's a good chance there's a Hilton near the customer I'm traveling to see.This visit, I dragged my husband with me since this month was busy as far as business travel goes and I was tired of being away. (Dragging hubby with me is sort of selfish - it makes the business trip go easier for me) :)What a gorgeous hotel! We stayed at the Hilton Boston Financial District, and being a Hilton Honors member, we received complimentary breakfast coupons for the two days we were there. That was a nice touch.Check-in was mostly hassle-free, though our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we had to wait about an hour and a half. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant CaliTerra to kill time, which ended up being a really nice treat. I had a personal pizza for lunch, while my husband had a grilled turkey panini that he enjoyed. Upon checking in, the room was immaculate. Gorgeous furnishings, impressively-made bed (I love the Hilton Heavenly beds), beautiful bathroom fixtures/decor; this hotel was beautiful all the way around. There was the bed, a nice sitting area with a TV/armoire, and a comfortable chair and desk.Housekeeping offered turn-down service. They freshened your room as well. That's a great touch, to be honest! To see the bed (which is inviting anyway) dressed for you to snuggle deep into the down comforter with the cold weather howling outside ... it's almost irresistible...Room service was actually the best I've had in a hotel anywhere. I had a fantastic spinach tortellini in a cheese sauce, while my husband had a frou-frou pizza, and we split a caesar salad. Frankie the Yankie delivered our food and was so funny to chat with. The kitchen was actually quick to deliver our meal, I was pleasantly surprised.The workout room was beautifully equipped, though the equipment needed a good cleaning. There were three Precor brand treadmills, two Precor brand elliptical runners, and two recumbent-style Precor brand bikes. Each had an entertainment system with headphones so you could either listen to music or watch TV while you worked out. There were also some free weights and a few pieces of universal-style gym equipment. Unfortunately, there was virtually no room to stretch on the floor or do yoga, though there was a yoga mat. There was also no water within the gym; you had to step out of the gym (take your room key with you) to drink from the water fountain outside the gym.The hotel was located a few blocks from the State Street T, so it was a short walk away, though dragging your suitcase through downtown Boston was tough, with the crappy ruddy narrow sidewalks. The State Street T can take you virtually anywhere you need to go so the location was great.I would definitely stay at this hotel again.-Jen","Dec 23, 2008","0","0",5,6,6,6,5,6,1,"4","$322"

The front desk agent, Lourdes, was kind  friendly, as were both Concierges....Charles was excellent with directions  a super nice guy! My room (732) had an amazingly comfortable king bed!!---best hotel bed ever--even tops my Four Seasons/Ritz Stays!, nice, roomy bathroom with excellent water pressure  great hot water, as well as La Source Crabtree  Evelyn bath amenties---nice smelling soaps  creams. The room also had very high ceilings, was quite spacious, offered a large desk  roomy closet with robe, iron/board, etc. The lobby is small, but boutique-y,  has two seperate entrances. I had room service for breakfast, which was good, except for a runny egg--as promised, it arrived within 30 minutes to my room (exactly). Christina, the in-room dining order taker, called me after I finished my meal just to make sure everything was well---very nice touch--they never call at luxury properties, so suprised when they called. She was very polite  a pleasure to speak with! The elevators were a little dirty, with some chipped wood (no big deal), but the room was in good shape...the tub looked ever so slightly brown(nothing big enough to call for), but I'm sure that was just usual wear--tear from guests. The lobby had a coffee/tea set-up in the AM, which was also nice. Good location for Fanieul Hall, etc, but about a 20-25 min. walk to Newbury Street, Beacon Hill, etc. Be sure to visit Flour Bakery, Neptune Oyster,  Stephanie's on Newbury..all great places to dine! Boston's street layout is super super confusing, so I was lost quite a bit, so be careful when navigating the city!

"hotel_189","hotel_4984","Not the best, but... I wasn't entirely impressed with this Hilton. I stayed here during Greenbuild, a large convention held down at the BCEC. This hotel is located in the financial district, which is convenient to both business and tourist attractions. There are also several pubs on Broad Street (I recommend Mr Dooleys!) and a Panera Bread nearby which are all much more affordable and better food than the restaurant in the hotel.The furnishings are very nice, with granite-topped tables and a comfortable bed. The staff was friendly and helpful, from the check-in desk to the cleaning staff that helped me manuever my large suitcase into the elevator on my way out!However, beyond that, there were several things about my room that made my stay less enjoyable. The heating system did not seem to blow warm air despite much fiddling with the thermostat, and the fan would turn on and off very erratically which woke me up throughout the night. There were two windows in my room which would have been very nice, except that they leaked cold air into the room like a sieve. The heavy drapes worked well at blocking the drafts, but it was still very difficult to keep the room warm (and this was in November!). Thankfully there was a down comforter on the bed! The room itself was pretty small too. Not uncomfortably so, but I had a hard time finding a place to put the luggage rack with my extra-large suitcase on it where it wasn't in the way.The bathroom was large, but there was only one hook for towels in the entire room. I would up having to hang my toiletry kit on the handtowel loop, which was kind of awkward. I also conducted a test of their towel reuse program (I try to do this in every hotel I stay in), and marked one of my towels with make-up before hanging it on the one hook. The next day the towels were folded and put away, and the one I had marked was not there. So much for being green. (Although they did convert to CFL bulbs in all the light fixtures, but the inefficiency of the windows probably negated any energy savings they might have had.)If you are traveling to Boston anytime soon, there may also still be construction on Franklin Street, complete with jackhammers and backhoes starting up at 7 am!Lastly, I would note that the toiletries and soaps provided reminded me of my grandmother... very floral and perfumey, and not pleasant to use.Next time I visit Boston, I will be trying another hotel.","Nov 22, 2008","1","1",4,3,6,4,6,6,4,"4","$322"

One item I should mention; there is no safe in the room. Valuables have to be stored in safe boxes located with the concierge. This is not a problem except for the fact that boxes are limited in size and number.

There are no hooks in the bathroom, no make-up mirror, and no shelves for cosmetic bags. The oblong wastebaskets are so narrow they can't hold much. The bathroom had a loud low-flow toilet that took forever to fill. The hotel has an exercise room but it is geared toward cardiac machines and lacks a good assortment of exercise equipment, although it does have free weights. It also seems designed for tall men: I couldn't use the chin-up bar because I could barely reach it!We had stayed at 2 other hotels and 1 BB during this trip, including one other Hilton.

Take your laptop down to the Hotel Library, where Hilton offers complementary wireless through WayPort (or something like that) ISP (for free). Sign up (by going to Google.com, and it will redirect you, follow the prompt), then go up to your room, and the same ISP will let you use it for free until 3PM the following day.

Check-in was convenient. Even though the front desk staff was proficient, it felt insincere. If I spoke Spanish they may have been more personable. They were efficient and polite just enough so you really couldn't complain but you didn't walk away feeling you were a welcome guest either. I am a Hilton Honors Silver member. I asked if that meant anything and it didn't because she didn't offer anything. I asked at the HIlton Boston Airport and got a free upgrade even though I didn't qualify.The hotel room was spacious, the beds very comfortable and the linens nice. If you left the hot water running too long in the shower, the mold on the grout would flake off. Hardly any of the ice machines worked, I had to travel several floors before finding one. The maid staff new there was no ice but obviously didn't report it to management.The A/C was practically non-existent. We called the front desk at 9:00PM to ask for an engineer but one never showed up. The front desk did call and inquire but that was the last of any front desk assistance. We saw the engineer on the elevator in the morning and asked him to check it. The only way we knew he had been there was the thermostat was lower than we left it.In order to use the elevators above floor 4, you need to slide your card. This was not explained at the desk. This hotel was popular with tour buses. Every night, I would find older couples trying to figure out how to get off on their floor. Luckily they were British and Irish and we could communicate. A good example of the lack of customer service.We left a flyer on the door for breakfast the next morning. My traveling companion didn't put the room number on it. The person collecting the cards obviously didn't check for that information. It was that lack of attention that makes this hotel just okay. Luckily we got a corporate rate of $209 a night. If I had paid more, I would have been very disappointed.Even though the hotel was in a great location, I won't return. The service was just mediocre and left me feeling like just another paying customer. If you didn't ask for a service it wasn't offered and if you didn't report a problem, it wasn't addressed.

"hotel_189","hotel_4488","Great Hilton I am writing this review not because I had any complaint about the Hilton's property but because I think the reviews on this site are slightly misleading. When I read them, I had expected the hotel to be of the level you might expect of a Ritz or a Four Seasons. It isn't, it is just a very good Hilton, showing all the good things of a high end Hilton and no criticisms but just not a five star hotel.The beds are comfy, the bathrooms great, the service fine. The public areas are limited though, which is partly why I don't belive it is a 5 star hotel.The bar next door, Mr Dooleys, was FANTASTIC!!! I can not recommend it highly enough for friendly excellent service and really good Irish breakfasts.","Aug 25, 2008","1","1",5,6,6,6,5,5,5,"4","$322"

The caesar salad was one of the best I have ever tasted.

"hotel_189","hotel_8258","Good location, clean, but spendy! Hotel's lcoation is convenient and close to a lot of things to do. Hotel is in an old buidling with nicely done rooms. The lobby area was small and 'felt' crowded. Though the room was small, the room did contain a King size bed, sitting chair w/Ottoman and business desk. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Even with the expected higher rates of a downtown location, I found the price per night to be expensive for the room I had. With the hotels close proximity to restaurants and its' downtown location, garbage trucks were out in force beginning around 4:30AM emptying the dumpsters in the area. It was quite loud. And beginning around 6AM the food and service delivery trucks for the restaurants began making their deliveries. From the hotel it is a short walk to a variety of restaurants and bars. Also, it is close to Qunicy Market, Faneuil Hall, Old State House and shopping. For something a little different. we took a water taxi to Logan airport instead of regular taxi. The water taxi can be picked up behind the Harbor Place Hotel (about two blocks from the Hilton), rate is $10, and it drops you off on airport property where you can pick up a bus shuttle to the terminal.

"hotel_189","hotel_8823","nice hotel This was the perfect location for a weekend getaway for me and my girlfriend. Hotel was very clean and beds were adorned with a down comforter and 6 down pillows! The heavy drapes were very good at keeping out the sunlight which allowed us to sleep in a little longer. There are tons of bars and shops within walking distance including Quincy Market and the waterfront attractions. Subway (T) is a few blocks away and easily accessible.The Concierge was helpful and the Bell hops were on the ball and abundant . The front desk was OK but I never got the warm and fuzzies from them. Room service was quick with a breakfast of fresh berries, muffins and hot coffee. The North End was a fairly short T ride to North Station and a quick walk from there. A must if you like homemeade italian cooking. The whole area feels like a street carnival on a weekend night. Lots of fun.Overall I would definitely stay here again. The only problem we experienced was the constant whirling of the AC unit outside below the window. If you remember, ask for a room away from the hotels AC unit.

The bed was extremely comfortable with numerous pillows.Their location is excellent. Within walking distance of most downtown attractions and several subway stops. After dinner we felt very safe walking back to the hotel after dark.Our only complaint is that the front desk would not give us the room key until exactly 3:00pm, their check-in time. I approached the desk at 2:50 and they made us wait the ten minutes until the official check-in time.Their concierge, John, was very helpful.

When this came up as the best price was a little worried about the location from looking at the online map, BUT THE LOCATION IS GREAT. We could, and did, walk to everywhere.Not sure why it was so cheap (was a weekend stay) but it was one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in. The room was very good size by any standard. The financial district seemed safer than other parts of the city, light traffic. Subway and harbor less than 5 minute walk away, shops and restaurants, bars all around. We skipped the hotel valet parking @ $38 a day and found all-day weekend parking for $9.00 per day, 2 blocks away at the Postal Square garage. We never took the car out for the whole weekend. Never eat at the hotel but breakfast was cheap at the nice Panera Bread 1 block away. Hotel bar nice for an upscale place for a drink. Staff were great with advice and maps on where to go and all very polite.For a person that travels a lot I don't easily give out excellent marks but in my opinion they earned it especially at the rate we paid.If I come back to Boston this is where I will stay again.","Jul 1, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,1,5,1,4,"4","$322"

The beds are extremely comfortable and went to sleep easily unlike many hotel beds. The room and bathroom were both a very good size. Both were extremely well kept and clean. We had a corner room which i believe is slighlty larger then a regular room and has more natural light. The hotel is near quincy market and south station ect and most of the main attractions are wthin a five min walk. For breakfast quciny market has some options, there are a couple of near by delis and a place called panera bread has wonderful tasting bagels.The only thing about the hotel is that it is not very well light and as we waled at night form the station it took a little to find even though it has 2 entrances. Also for a modern room a flatscreen tv would have fitted in a bit better but the one we had worked fine.Overall i would completley come back and would stay here over any of the hotels near the pru as i feel that this is a nicer location in boston to stay esp for fisrst time visitors.","Jun 29, 2008","0","0",5,5,5,6,4,6,3,"4","$322"

The entire staff was very polite and helpful. The hotel was in a great location, and my coworkers and I were able to walk to dinner and shopping nearby. My room had a beautiful comfortable bed, but...My room was on the 4th floor directly above a giant air conditioning unit on a lower roof of the hotel. The unit hummed all night and I regretted not packing a sleep aid! I asked about using a business center to print out my boarding passes. The business center (2 computers and 1 printer) charged a minimum of $10 to get online. If a patron is paying $349 per night, being able to use a business center to print out a boarding pass and check flight status should be free and not at an additional charge. I also found the hotel a bit dark because of the decor (mustard yellow  green patterned carpeting).Overall, it was adequate lodging for a business trip, but I've stayed in better for less.","Jun 27, 2008","0","0",3,4,6,5,6,5,2,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_4475","Good hotel, but some probelms I stayed here for three nights. The facility was fine. Large and comfortable room. Spotless bathroom. However, front desk staff was a problem.When I checked in a very rude woman was working the desk. We ended up having an argument over earning HiltonHHonors points. I was tired after a long and frustrating plane ride so I let the matter drop for the moment.Upon my check in the hotel placed a $300 hold on my credit card. I was not told of the hold by the rude font desk clerk so it came as an embarrassing surprise later that night when I tried to use my card to pay for dinner at a local restaurant.I ate dinner in the hotel restaurant the second night. The food and service were just fine, until it came time to pay the bill. I do not like to make charges to my room, so I put my credit card in the bill folder and waited for the server to make the charge. The server never came back; I assume he thought I was going to charge the meal to my room. I ended up having to charge the dinner to my room.Finally, on my last day I decided to make a complaint to the hotel management. The same rude woman from my check in was working the desk with another clerk. The rude woman and the other clerk actually tried to tell me that no manager was available to take my complaint. I held my ground and insisted that I speak with a manager, even if they had to call one from home. No surprise, they were suddenly able to find a manager, who turned out to be the Director of Revenue. I assume that is a fancy title for Sales Manager. The manager was actually very sympathetic and was able to resolve my complaints to my satisfaction.Overall, the hotel was a nice place to stay and I would recommend it to others.","Jun 26, 2008","1","1",4,6,5,6,2,3,1,"4","$322"

"hotel_189","hotel_3701","Unremarkable I am finding more and more that the Hilton chain is also inconsistent. Some of them look great and treat you well. I stayed at this one only to try a new hotel in Boston after the Langham and the Westin Waterfront. This hotel was bland and unexciting. Although the staff do treat you nicely and try to remember your name (appreciated), the room (two doubles) was small and there was no view and did not have a nice hotel feel to it. I suppose it may be too much to ask a downtown hotel. There seemed to be many priceline guests, and so though it is in a business district, the clientele seemed less businesslike.The Langham around the corner had more of an upscale feel to it.

The non-suite room we moved to for the last two nights of our stay was a very large room so it would have sufficed perfectly. Extremely clean. We spent very little time in the room. I loved the proximity of everything in the Financial District. We bought Trolley tickets but got off at stop 4 and just walked everywhere - and I am not a walker. With our suite upgrade were free tickets to the buffet that they charge $19.95. Do not waste your money on the buffet. The food is unbelievable expensive in the restaurant. There is a Panera Bread just down the road and plenty of little shops to get a bite to eat. Quincy Market, North End all within walking distance.

If the weather is reasonable, it is also within a nice walk of Boston Common, Boston Garden (Make Way for Ducklings), and upscale shopping on Newberry and Boylston Streets. Our room was very comfortable in the nicely refurbished 1920's Art Deco building. The hotel had an excellent small restaurant with a fine buffet breakfast - free to Hilton Gold members.

We called the front desk again at 1:30am and asked if they had any earplugs and was just told no.

"hotel_189","hotel_7934","Worst Experience If you are a Federal employee, I'd advise you to stay away from this property. I arrived on Monday night for a three night stay while attending training. I provided my official identification and travel orders. The desk clerk told me that this information wouldn't be sufficient since my travel orders were e-mailed to me, I didn't have a tax exempt number (?), and I didn't have printed travel orders on official stationary, sign by my department head describing the purpose and length of my stay. I told him that he was wrong. He said that he'd check with his accounting office and leave me a message the next day. Apparently there was no one after four who could deal with this dilema. When I went back the next day, the clerk told me that the accounting person had called during the day when he wasn't working and asked if I'd like to speak with this person.  The next day the person in charge of my training spoke with the accounting person. A resolution was reached. If I provided a Form 9828, they would not charge sales tax for my stay. That afternoon, upon returning to the hotel, I provided the desk with the completed form with the direction to bring it to the accounting person. Upon checking out, the charges were still there.","Mar 20, 2008","1","0",2,3,3,4,2,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_10602","Claustrophobic room; rude staff, great location I am surprised to see all the reviews of this hotel describing their large rooms. Our experience was not pleasant. We came to Boston to celebrate St Patrick's Day with my sister who lives in Boston. My sister and her son came with us as we checked in. A rude young woman at the desk smirked to my husband in mock surprise oh, your family is very large, implying that we were trying to stuff extra people into the room. We should have left the hotel at that point! Our room was very small (even by Manhattan standards!) and very dark- overlooking an interior alleyway. Our ceiling light had a naked bulb -- I asked for a globe to cover it as soon as we entered the room - but when we returned 4 hours later it was still not done. After a second request they finally fixed it. The tub drain did not work properly either. We picked this hotel for the excellent location,but I will never stay there again. Our overall impression was that it was an old, dark, cramped and aging building with creaking elevators and rude staff.

Very quiet! Hotel bar was posh and the drink prices reflected that, but it is downtown Boston. Hotel bar closed at 11:30pm, but the staff was very helpful in helping us find some cheaper, more relaxed places to hang out that were very close by. Even on weeknights some of the local dance/karaoke places were hoppin'. Had room service for breakfast and it arrived quickly and everything was still hot. Only complaint was the limited table space (small round table next to bed full of stuff and a cluttered desk). Not really convenient for eating in your room. Everything was very clean and the shower and bath fixtures looked brand new (Kohler). Elegant lobby and brass finishings everywhere.

The rooms were well kept, clean and with adequate space, with lovely crabtree and Evelyn toilettries The staff we fantastic in the hotel; I had problems using a $500 travellers cheque in one shop (not accepted in most of Boston due to a freud problem), yet the conceierge went totally out of his way to find a store who would cash it for me, he was amazing, thanks Charles. The reception was welcoming with wood panneling and seasonal Christmas decor, enhanced by complementary hot chocolate or mulled apple available from mid afternoon onwards. The restaurant provided lovely food, but it was was pricey: there is an excellent Irish pub for evening meals and deli's for breakfast on the door step though. The location was great, the city is so walkable, Quincys Markets is 3 minutes walk away, yet the hotel was quiet- some of us who had previously stayed in NewYork for shopping trips were amazed at how silent the rooms were at night, and how quiet the streets were.

"hotel_189","hotel_9200","Great stay at the Hilton Stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights up to 30 Dec. We were in Boston to attend a family wedding and had a total of 8 rooms between 14 people which were conveniently all located on the same floor. Really liked the hotel, the room and bathroom were spacious, clean and well kept. As others have noted room size is really pot luck, we had a pretty decent double room, however my brother who was staying on his own had a room about twice as large as ours! In any case our room size was perfectly adequate for our needs. Beds were large and comfortable and there was a lovely selection of toiletries in the bathroom. Our room was kept clean and well tided and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Some of my family who were flying back to Ireland on 31 Dec asked for and were given a late checkout free of charge. Location is pretty quiet but there are still a number of restaurants closeby and you can either walk or take a short taxi journey to all sights.There were a couple of irritations during our stay. The water in the rooms cost a hefty $4.50 per bottle. Arriving off a long flight from Germany we didn't have much opportunity to go out and buy cheaper water, so ending up paying $9 for approx. 1 litre of water! In saying that the next evening when we got back to our room, we'd been given a couple of bottles of complimentary water, which was a nice gesture. My fiance was keen to check his emails whilst we were there. The hotel was advertising a rate of $9.99 for 24 hours in-room internet access via the TV (there was a keyboard attached). On signing up for this however it didn't work and when we rang the concierge they informed us that it was unavailable and that we should use the internet in the Business Center at a rate of $10 for 10 mins (which we didn't)! Other than these couple of minor issues our stay was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend the hotel to other travellers to Boston. We would definitely stay here again.","Jan 6, 2008","0","0",1,6,5,6,4,6,3,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_8158","Nice but some frustrations I wanted to love the Hilton, and in some ways, I did, but in others, we were disappointed. My husband and I just came back from enjoying two days there relaxing over New Year's, and there were positives. Our room was clean and large by city standards, but I agree with earlier posts that size of room is completely luck of the draw based on what I saw on the floor diagram. The bed was very comfortable, and the location of the hotel was great for being out and about in the city for First Night -- close enough to get there fast but far enough away to avoid the worst of the noise. The staff was great -- helpful and courteous, though we were disappointed that our request for an upper-floor room was not duly noted until we pointed it out, and then we were only put on floor 9 (of a 15 floor hotel). Our room maid was wonderful, however. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was fabulous -- a really good buffet though it was part of a package for us. Not cheap if you have to pay separately, but worth it.And that brings me to the negatives. The hotel nickels and dimes you with charges for things that in other hotels might be part of the high rate charged. Wireless internet is on a per-day charge, and if you instead decide that you'll just use the hotel's Business Center, be prepared to pay a minimum of a $10 charge then $1 per minute after 10 minutes. This seemed ludicrous to us who just wanted to check our e-mail. The bottles of water in the room were available for a mere $4.50 each (we bought some of our own nearby for a lot less), and a $80 charge for dinner in the hotel bar when we only had a few drinks and two light entrees seemed really high, even by hotel restaurant standards. In general, it seemed that the four-star rating was not really warranted given how many of the little extras one expects at four-star locales involved extra charges here. In addition, there were some aging issues -- the sheet that had a hole along the edge where it was folded over on our bed; the scratchy towels that were too old to still be soft and fluffy; the slightly worn wood on the furniture like the arm chair and entertainment center. The room was also quite noisy, in part due to the expected city sounds, but also due to how easily we could here our loud neighbors across the hall as they came and went.It was not a bad experience -- in fact, we were quite happy when all was said and done. But with a little more inclusiveness in their rates and some upgrading of slightly aging fixtures, this hotel could more fully embody a four-star experience.","Jan 1, 2008","4","2",4,5,6,6,4,6,2,"4","$322"

The lobby is beautiful with a well-appointed library and free coffee in the morning and cider in the evening. You need a room key to access upper floors from the elevator which adds a feeling of security. The rooms are enormous. The ceiling height is phenomenal. The views (and we were only on the 6th floor of 15) were fantastic. We had booked two rooms for our family of five, but easily could have fit into one room. One of our rooms was a corner room and I think it was as big as three other hotel rooms would have been. We were hoping for connecting rooms, but they don't have those at all. That was our only disappointment with the hotel. The building is very old and solidly built, so once you close your door, you hear nothing from hallways, rooms next door or rooms above.The rooms were well decorated and the beds were very comfortable. We had free breakfast passes and thoroughly enjoyed the buffet. The staff at the restaurant and throughout the hotel were very helpful. They even let us borrow a screwdriver which we needed to put together a Christmas present (not to fix anything in our room, don't worry).The hotel is right across from restaurants and bars and cafes and only a few blocks from Quincy Market, the Freedom Trail and the Aquarium. It was an easy walk to South Station and fairly close to the Children's Museum.

We stayed in a suite that we found to be very nice. It was bigger than a suite at something like the Embassy Suites, a little nicer too. The bathroom was nice but nothing too elaborate. The only concerns I had about the hotel itself was that the walls were thin so that if someone was watching TV with much volume next to you, you may be able to tell what they are watching. Also, if you are on a low floor, you may hear noise from the streets. We were on the 4th floor and could hear the Red Sox celebrations coming from the local watering holes. But not enough to keep me from staying here. We did wish they had a resonable, or even better, free breakfast. But, there are several spots to stop close by for a quick breakfast. Note that since this hotel is in the business district, some places are not open on weekends. It was less than a 10 minute walk to the T. Would be nice if a little closer, but nothing too bad.

In the event we got a room on the 5th floor. Firstly since this is the financial district, some of the rooms are surrounded by high buildings and are gloomy (we turned the first room down since it was dark and very small) but got allocated another on the 5th floor overlooking Broad Street. What all the reviews here dont state is that every morning between 3-4 a.m. the rubbish for the street is collected, and very noisy it is too. After this come all the deliveries for the street and so its almost impossible to get any sleep after 3-4 a.m.The facilities could do with some updating as well. There was no room safe and one of those silly hairdryers attached to the wall in the bathroom (and yes I am being picky but when you suffer from sleep deprivation, thats what happens!)The staff mostly were very pleasant.

"hotel_189","hotel_9138","Best Sleep Ever The most memorable thing about this stay was the bed since I managed to have the best rest I've had in months. The bed is absolutely comfy.I reserved the room on Hilton's website and noted that I wanted did not want feather bedding. My experience has been that most hotels ignore this request until I arrive and I have to call housekeeping to replace the bedding.During the check-in, the front desk actually told me that they noted my request for no feather bedding and accommodated my request. What a very pleasant surprise.The room was huge, even with two double beds in it -- I thought it could have fit a few more pieces of furniture. That was how big the room was. It's a nice change from claustrophobic hotels that give you tiny rooms that you can barely move in.Amenities (bathroom, mini bar) were very nice, and of course, who could miss the Herman Miller chair (that was comfy, too). Obviously, the hotel is advertising these products: their special beds by Serta, the chair, the Moen shower head, etc. Yes, I ooh-d and ahh-d over these items and liked it.The Hilton was in the business district of Boston, so it was dead quiet on the weekend, and many diners/restaurant were closed during the day because they cater to the business crowd. There are several bars in the area where the kids hang out, but it the hotel was sufficiently far enough that there were no noticeable street noise.However, there are two shopping areas within walking distance of the hotel, so when I had to buy a few things I forgot to pack, it was no trouble to find a department store and a drug store near by.It's also close to the Freedom Trail, if one is ambitious and packed sneakers to do it.The hotel was efficient in it's check in and check out procedures. Housekeeping was impeccable.The only down side to our stay is their restaurant: does not open on time nor does it have great service. We waited for 20-30 minutes after the 7 a.m. posted time for the restaurant to open for breakfast. Since none of the area restaurants/diners were open on the weekend, we were stuck waiting for this one. We would have left and found another place to go if it was the weekday. As for the service: the wait staff spent more time running around like chickens without heads than actually doing their jobs. The breakfast buffet was anemic: there were too many missing items, like no dairy, but they put the cereal out. Pancakes and no maple syrup. That sort of thing. Good luck trying to get the staff's attention to actually ORDER breakfast from their menu.We did not order room service since we have had bad experience with it in the past in other hotels. As we were going down to breakfast, I did notice quite a few room service lids/service table next to service elevator. Room service start at 6:30 a.m. on weekends and the restaurant was supposed to be open at 7 a.m. In hindsight, we probably should have ordered room service.If have a car, the valet parking here is expensive: $35/day. There is a parking garage nearby -- that's the same garage your car is going to be in since the Hilton does not have a garage on the premises. The valet runs there to get your car.In the end, I enjoyed my stay despite the restaurant's shortcomings. We only had breakfast there. There are tons of better restaurants in Boston for lunch, dinner and drinks.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay at a better hotel.","Aug 28, 2007","1","1",5,6,5,6,5,5,1,"4","$322"

The hallways were FREEZING but interestingly my room never got that cold as I usually like to sleep with the air set low. Beds were comfortable and slept well however the water pressure in the shower was a bit unpredictable as well as the temperature which seemed to fluctuate between really hot and really cold. There was also a really noisy vent in the room that seemed to kick on randomly; not sure if it was connected to the a/c or not. My only real complaint with the hotel was the cost of the items in the lobby bar. Don't hotels serve plain old hamburgers anymore? Instead its a goat cheese and roma tomato pizza for 15 dollars. Luckily there are a couple of great pubs in the area, one practically next door however when its raining you wish that you didn't have to leave the hotel.The location was ok. Bit of a walk to the T and Boston Common. I arrived on a Sunday and the neighborhood, being the financial district, was really quiet with no one around. In fact almost every night was really quiet which made coming home in the evenings a bit concerning as there were very few people around.Would stay there again if I had to but I would imagine there are much better hotels in the area for the amount of money I paid.","Aug 20, 2007","0","0",4,3,3,5,4,4,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_7638","Great Hotel My Mother and I have just returned from a wonderful trip to Boston. The Hilton is a great Hotel with a nice location to major attractions. We had a small problem with a leaky faucet in the bathroom and in return for the inconvience we got a free room upgrade and vouchers for a free buffet breakfast offered at the hotel for the remainder of our trip. The staff could not have been more helpful and accomadating. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. I love to visit Boston not only for the History,great food, and culture but also because the people who live in Boston are so pleasant. We had a bit of difficulty riding the T and it was through the kindness of strangers that made the trip more enjoyable.","Aug 10, 2007","0","0",5,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_4224","Service bad at times After finding out that my room wasn't ready, I checked in my bag with the bellhop. The bellhop asked me if I was a guest there and then laughed. I didn't find this to be funny at all - very rude actually. This is a small issue, but still reflects on the attention to detail: the next morning, I noticed every room had a USA today newspaper at its doorway except mine. Lastly, when I had forgotten to check out via the phone system, I had called a few hours later and notified the front desk that I needed to check out. The person at the front desk said in an unpleasant tone that the room was checked out and that meant that somebody in my room must of checked me out. Clearly, I was the only guest and I replied that if I didn't check out, then obviously, I was under the impression that I still needed to. This was an incident that this employee made unnecessarily unpleasant. These may be small incidents, but next time I'm going to stay at another hotel with better service.","Aug 5, 2007","2","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_1405","Excellent Overall Experience Stayed here for 2 nights with wife and daughter (10) at the start of our vacation. I have stayed in Boston many times and found this property to be in a great spot for siteseeing. My rate (Hilton internet prepaid) was (got two nights for slighty greater than one night's rate at Longwharf Marriott for example) good compared to nearby properties. The room was of very good size, was quiet, and had very comfortable bedding. They were efficient enough to have the roll away bed already in the room when we checked out (this seems to happen infrequently elsewhere). The bathroom was nice and had a great shower. We had a tiny view of Boston Harbor but mainly of nearby buildings. In addition to the nice room the major asset of this hotel is its location. Several short blocks to Faniuel Hall/ Quincy Market, the New England Aquarium, Colombus Park, waterfront, etc. It's also a very easy walk into the North End (the Italian section with an exceptional number of great restarants, etc). You can also walk a block or two in the AM to a great bagel place (Finagel a Bagel), among many other casual places to eat and drink. Subway access is extremely close by. No pool (sorry, kids). Also, no safe in the rooms but there is a front desk safe deposit box with 24/7 access. Staff was not unfriendly but bellmen seemed to be always talking to their friends rather than greeting guests, opening door (as other places seem to do). No big deal. Concierge was nice as was gentleman at check out time. Would definitely consider staying here again and would recommend it to a friend.","Aug 2, 2007","0","0",6,5,6,6,5,5,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_5701","Great location for aquarium  My daughter and I had the Hilton FAMILY PACKAGE which was a real deal! We got tickets to the aquarium, breakfast buffet, an in-room movie, snack bags of popcorn and little soda bottles. It also comes with a Discovery Kids backpack filled with a digicam and other little things. We had a great time!The walk to the aquarium and whale watching is super easy and then also a quick hop to Quincy Market. This hotel is excellently located for that part of town. (A cab to Copley Plaza was $8)Our corner room (1216) was a suite with living room, dining table with 4 chairs plus a king bedroom. We had some very nice harbor and surrounding views. The bed was plush and comfortable with lots of pillows. The bathroom was marble and excellent. I am now a big fan of the Crabtree and Evelyn La Source products that the hotel provided.We had room service for dinner and the table was perfect for that purpose. The margarita pizza was very tasty and the kid's pasta was hearty. The room has a wet bar which we didn't use.The breakfast buffet at Caliterra was perfect....lots of choices both healthy and decadent.I followed a GREAT tip from another tripadvisor post and parked around the corner at ONE and TWO INTERNATIONAL PLACE for $7 on the weekends. I was in at noon and out at 3pm the next day for $7.00. This was a huge savings and literally is a few minutes walk to the hotel.My only complaint is that the ventilation does let smoke smells come through.

"hotel_189","hotel_4761","Not great. We initially picked this Hilton because of the location (within walking distance to a lot of the great sites of Boston as well as the T). Unfortunately, it's location ended up being the most redeeming quality.We booked a three-night stay with one night being covered by Hilton Honors Points. Our room was on the top floor (15th) with a nice view of the water. I found the room itself to be average--I would have expected more from a Hilton (and our $199 per night price). The carpet was a bit worn as was the chair. The bathroom was tiny and the vanity mirror on the wall was broken. It did look like they were doing some work in the hallways (until almost 10pm one night!) and the lobby so perhaps it will get better.After our first night we spent the day exploring wonderful Boston. Upon returning to our room at close to 4pm we found housekeeping had not been in it. We called the front desk to inquire and they said they'd check and call us. They never called but soon someone from housekeeping showed up and told us we were supposed to have checked out of our room at 3pm that day! We once again called the front desk (they seemed clueless) and were told they'd have another set of keys brought to us which didn't make sense at all. We decided to go down to the front desk and take care of it. We found two staff that both were trying to work on our problem at the same time but the other didn't know it. They ended up getting into a discussion about it right in front of us. We overheard them say another staff member had booked someone else in our room for two nights. After a wait, we were given new keys to the same room. They said they were sorry but that was it. We found one concierge to be quite helpful (Dragona?) and the other not helpful at all.Also note--the walls are thin and there is no soundproofing to the outside. There are many bars around the hotel and it gets really really loud after 2a.m.I don't think we'll stay here again. Our Hampton Inn in Manhattan during the same trip was much nicer, more updated and quieter than the Hilton in Boston.","Jul 9, 2007","4","3",3,3,5,5,4,3,1,"4","$322"

"hotel_189","hotel_5129","Not bad... Not AMAZING, but not bad. It did just fine... I have stayed in A LOT of hotels in my life and I just loved how the Hilton has marble bathrooms. It made everything else lacking seem much more luxurious than it probably was.The hotel staff is VERY VERY VERY slow, and though they are nice people, they are not the most accommodating. Upon check in I was given a smoking handicapped access room. Even though that room (for all you needing handicap access rooms) is absolutely GORGEOUS, I really didnt prefer it. So I went back downstairs, told them to give me a king non-smoking, and they agreed. Room was changed in about an hour. Again, very slow staff.The room itself was on the top floor (the 15th), and on the small side, but still nice. The decor was nice, the carpet seemed clean, the room updated enough. The bathroom was ginormous, and the toiletries were complete.Parking is $39/day and only offered as valet. The location is good though a little confusing to find if you are driving. A hint: From the waterfront, find State Street. Once you see Club Vertigo, turn left. That is Broad.Location is literally a four minute walk to Faneiul Hall, and thirty second walk to the first bar. Walkable to the North End, the waterfront, and a bit of a hike to Back Bay.Great location. The hotel itself was fine. Not breathtaking, but suitable for a four star.

Gave us a room on 12th floor even could see the water if we leaned a little. Huge refurbished room, thick terry bathrobes, nice marble/chrome bathroom. Only minor complaint was everything was feathers, pillows  comforter, and I'm super allergic. They did everything to try and find hypoallergenic ones but too late for the first night (our fault for checking in late). The staff is above and beyond in the service and friendly department. Clean rooms, clean hotel. They serve great coffee in the morning in the lobby area, take a cup back to the room, although there are little 2 cup makers in the room, but that's work! Book thru priceline if you can, it's SO worth it! I could give it a 5 star, but save those for the REALLY REALLY special places, this is in the heart of the city and it's a nice hotel, but not REALLY REALLY special if you see what I mean... The location btw is unbeatable, we were about 10 minutes walk from the Omni Parker House, where there was a wedding attended. The church was another 5 minutes, and it's really a safe area all around... no need to worry even for two single (great looking I might add....LOL) women!!!!!!!!

"hotel_189","hotel_6483","Pretty hotel, nice location, bad for sleeping I booked this hotel at a reasonable rate on a popular discount travel website, cost for a Thursday and Friday night stay were $100 each night before taxes. The hotel was easy to find and is quite nice on the inside. We were given a corner room on the 4th floor which was spacious with a large bathroom. Trying to fall asleep the first night was not easy. A door near our room kept being opened and closed and it was easy to hear the conversation of the person in the next room who stayed on the phone until close to midnight and then was up talking again at 6:30am. We mentioned this to management and they said that security would check to be sure it was a bit quieter the next night. Same problem again just with new neighbors. I was very surprised at how thin the walls were at this 4 star hotel. Also we tried to use the internet, which cost over $10 just to gain access to, so we walked down the street and were able to find free wi-fi at a nearby cafe. I would not stay at this hotel again mainly because we were hardly able to get any sleep and the lack of reasonably priced services made it very inconvenient to get much done.","Mar 4, 2007","3","2",3,3,5,5,4,4,2,"4","$322"

"hotel_189","hotel_6774","Heed and beware! The general manager of the Bullfinch could not have been more accomodating online as I made my arrangements. My daughter and I wound up with a price that could not be beat for Boston in November, BUT... The rooms ARE small. I had to stand on my bed to open and close the drapes. I don't know how the housekeepers change the linens, which, by the way were very nice. The room appeared to be freshly painted, we had no problem with the carpet BUT the furniture looked like it came from a hotel surplus warehouse. On the third night, we rounded the little desk downstairs to find a note on the ONE elevator that it was out of service. It hadn't occurred to me when I booked the property to ask how many elevators the hotel had. We hiked up nine, well-lit flights of stairs, grateful that my 8-months-pregnant daughter was not with us! The next morning, the door to the stairwell started slamming open and closed very early giving us the clue the elevator had not been repaired. Two very courteous bellmen helped us down to the lobby that morning. The same gentleman who was manning the desk the night before was still there, and holding up well, actually. He'd already removed the third night's taxes and fees, about $40, from the bill, a fair adjustment. Would I stay at the Bullfinch in Boston again? No. It's on the fringe of a neighborhood that is being renovated, but it's not terribly desirable yet. I've never, in Europe or NYC or anywhere, stayed in a room that was as small as ours was.

"hotel_189","hotel_10211","Nice Hotel in Great Location This hotel is in an excellent location - easy access to the airport and walking distance to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market (5 mins), North End (10-15 mins) and Boston Common (15-20 mins) and which of course means the T is easily reachable.If you are a diamond club member, I'm sure your room will be sizeable, as it should be as a frequent Hilton guest. However, as a blue level member, paying a special rate through American Express, your room will not be as spacious. The first room I was shown (411) had the look and feel of Marriott Courtyard and was next to construction across the street. The second room (1103) with less noise was even smaller (if possible - and reminiscent of Europe), but fortunately comfortable. Both rooms according to the floor map on the back of the door were the smallest available on both floors. The rooms were nicely furnished and the beds comfortable. And, the bolsters from the beds work well to block the light coming from under the door to the hallway...Room 1103 had a couple of plumbing problems: the sink's cold water spigot leaked when off (a towel kept that from being too irritating), and the shower drain did not stay in the open position unless you either used a foot to push it down while showering (very precarious), or used the weight of a wet washcloth to hold it down (worked best!). Since the room wasn't flooding, and I could handle staying one more night with the inconvenience, I reported it to the front desk. They offered to change my room, but were otherwise not too concerned. I have a feeling that it won't be attended to until a guest becomes irate.The staff were pleasant, the rooms nicely decorated, and the location was excellent and I'd consider this a solid 3 and a half stars.","Nov 10, 2006","2","1",4,5,5,4,4,5,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_2503","Great location, superb service, excellent rooms! This former Wyndham hotel is Hilton's gain. In an absolutely superb location close to Quincy Market, Thaniel Hall, a T station, the Aquarium, along with many pubs and dining options of just about any variety all within walking distance.The rooms are superb. Hilton Diamond members this is your place. The suites, although not equipped with pricey furniture, are very large. Almost too large considering the very reasonable rate. The bed was quite comfortable. Not too soft, not too hard but giving.The staff are very polite, professional and helpful. But the key here is the very nice location and the superb rooms!This Hilton is a deal! Way to go Hilton.The only downside is what I experience at many Hiltons sadly including this one. Its Hilton's repeating canned commercials over their cable TV service. They repeat and repeat and repeat the same ads over and over again. Many of them are politically driven but made to appear as PSAs (public service announcements). HIV ads with Michael Douglas' narration, breast cancer and colon cancer ads running repeatedly become old quickly. If you are like me I like to leave the TV on while I do other things in my room. But hearing HIV infection statistics every 20 minutes is a bit depressing. Come on Hilton, just run the regular commercials everyone else watches please.","Oct 30, 2006","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_3208","Good Location and Price For anyone who goes to Boston, you will soon realize hotels are expensive. Having lived in Boston for 4 years, I chose the Hilton Financial based on location and price. I paid up front and got a great deal. Saved $60 on the company website compared to the lowest offe I found any any travel website (Orbitz, Yahoo Travel).Hotel is downtown in the financial district which is very quiet on weekend. It was only a 10-15 minute walk to Government Center or State Street subway stations so may not be the best for you in the dead of Boston's winter.There really is no lobby to speak of but the hotel is well kept and typical of a Hilton. Room was massivew. As a matter of factm, it had all the basic furniture (bed, desk, night stands, chairs) and the room still felt empty. Room was in great condition.Negatives were the view as its an old Boston hotel so most of the rooms are looking right at another building 25 feet away. Parking is valet only and costs $38 per night...a little much even for Boston.This was a good stay and Id go there again. Coming here as a tourist, its a 15 minute walk to Fanheuil Hall, Quincy Market and most subway lines. For business purposes, you're right where everything else is most likely.

"hotel_189","hotel_9883","Great Deal at the Hilton My family of three spent a night at this hotel after finding a great deal on Hotwire. Our room was extremely spacious and in addition to two comfortable queen size beds, we had a lovely sitting area with two chairs and footstools, a table and a television set. The bathroom was well decorated, stocked with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, and featured an excellent shower and plenty of thick towels. Everything was very clean.Due to scheduling problems I needed to request a late checkout. That was no problem and we were able to leave an hour later than the official check-out time. It probably helped that I had a Hilton Honors number.The concierge was very helpful on directions to dining and the doorman gave me terrific driving directions to Kenmare Square (although executing his directions was not for the squeamish!)It is possible to walk from this hotel to the Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall area and even over to the wharf or North End for excellent dining options. We also walked from the hotel to the south end of the Boston Common to visit Emerson College and on a beautiful day, it was a great walk which took about half an hour.Valet Parking was available for $38. If you are driving, I would recommend that you call the hotel and get detailed directions from them. We had a hard time following our mapquest directions with the dig construction and just generally confusing streets in this very old part of the city. I would definitely stay at at this excellent hotel again.","Oct 18, 2006","2","2",6,6,5,6,6,6,1,"4","$322"

"hotel_189","hotel_5081","A hidden gem in Downtown Boston! I wanted to stay in a nice hotel in downtown Boston for our anniversary. I tried Hotwire for my first time and paid $128 for one night! Apparently, it's common to get a Hotwire or Priceline deal for weekends - I noticed on other reviews after I booked this room. Being a holiday weekend, we were able to park on the street overnight for free. Tip-Book a Saturday night, feed the meter until 6pm or 8pm and save the price of a parking garage. The Hilton was just changed from a Wyndham this past June. It's a great location, very nice hotel, no problems. Would definately stay there again! A 4 star hotel in the business district of Boston for $128! It is hard to find but the staff is very helpful with directions whether you're walking or driving, Boston being confusing to a newcomer.","Oct 9, 2006","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"

I booked this hotel as a romantic getaway for my boyfriend and I thinking that I was getting this great deal. When we got there, the room was a handicap smoking room with two small beds. I know Hotwire doesnt allow you to request rooms- but the hotel could not switch us- and since are both non smokers it was less then romantic. Being New Yorkers we headed right for the coffee machine to find they only had stocked our room with decaf (this loses them big points in my book). Tried to order room service first night and it was unavailable. Second day there was no hot water in our room. Room service was ridiculously overpriced. On the flip side- the location was great- and thank you to the person that posted the note about parking down the street- it cost us only 21 bucks for the whole weekend as opposed to the 40 a night that rip off of a hotel charges.","Oct 9, 2006","2","0",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"

We were given a corner, handicapped room so lots of space. Everything was clean, everything worked right and the staff was pleasant. Location was almost perfect. We took the T from the airport. From the train station, right near Quincy Market, it's about five or six blocks. While it's the financial district and the area is quiet in some ways (i.e. delis and some shops mostly closed on the weekends), there were quite a few clubs, restaurants and bars right near by. It's about a mile to Boston Common and the sites there. We walked it with no problem. You can pick up the Freedom Trail near by. Ten minute walk to the North End and again Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall was a five minute. There are many restaurants, shops and sites near there.

For $105 per night, the Hilton was very nice indeed. The wireless internet worked, though I had some problems. I found that it works best if you connect to the network from the lobby and make sure your connection is working before taking your laptop up into your room. Things worked the way I wanted to that way.The housekeeping service was very good --- they accomodated my special requests. The front desk and checkin/checkout went smoothly --- the room was ready when I arrived late at night. The front desk conceirge was friendly, but he gave me the wrong number for Dominos (the one he gave did not deliver to this particular hotel) when I wanted to order a pizza.

Contrary to another review, our double room was HUGE and very nicely decorated (old world european style, not Sofitel european style). There were two beds, two large chairs with ottomans a large desk and chair with lots of room in between. We had four windows and a nice view of the financial district. Room 1008. The service was excellent, the hotel was clean (I don't think ANY hotel room carpet is clean) and well appointed. The bathroom was nice, toiletries Crabtree  Evelyn. The closet was very small. The beds were ok comfortable but the bedding was excellent. The front desk service was slow but very polite and accomodating except they wouldn't check us in at 2:40 pm with guaranteed check in time of 3pm. The concierge answered phones promptly and easily answered all questions. The doorman was ALWAYS there (the same one most of our stay?!?) They keep 2 cabs outside at all times. Our cab from the airport on Thurs at 2:30pm took 16 minutes, $17 fare. Our cab back to the airport Sunday at 11a took 9 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!! We were told it would take 40+ minutes since the latest big dig disasters. We were pleasantly surprised. Our only complaint other than the check in thing is that the hotel is not conveniently located for subway service. It's way too far to walk to the Back Bay/Copley/Newberry/Beacon Hill areas. We felt safe walking around the hotel at all hours of the day and night with lots of people around at all times, no sketchy types seen in the area at all. The hotel is an easy 5-10 minute walk to Quincy Market, many of the Freedom Trail sites,and the waterfront/aquarium. The North End was a pretty easy 15 minute walk, safe at night. The area seemed to have a pretty hoppin' nightlife. There was a cute pub, Mr. Dooley's right next door but we were always too tired to go in on our way home. It was busy every night. There are no restaurants in the area open for breakfast on weekends except the hotel restaurants. There was a Starbucks and a Dunkin' Donuts close by, though. The bar was open late. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant Sunday morning. The buffet was standard fare so we ate off the menu, also standard fare except I had a fantastic egg white and fresh vegie omelet. The coffee was fine. The service was quite good.  I would have given the hotel an excellent rating except for the check in problem.","Jul 24, 2006","12","12",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"

"hotel_189","hotel_9406","Excellent hotel, all things considered, including a great Priceline rate! CONS: Upon check-in, we were told there were no non-smoking double rooms. For my husband, me, and our two small children; one king bed was not ideal, and they said they would charge $30 for a roll out bed! Anyway, we took the double room, smoking of course. When we opened the door there were two people inside (!) The room's previous night's occupants had arranged to switch to a different room (not a good sign) and had asked that their luggage be moved from their old room--now our room--to their new room, but no one had done it (another not-so-good-sign). They were very apologetic, they left right away, and they hadn't touched anything in the room, as they had only come back to fetch their luggage. But, a smoky-smelling room with people inside was a big bummer, especially after an already disappointing start.PROS: It was a clean and very nice room, with lots of big windows, awesome beds  linens, lovely toiletries, and almost everything in the room was newly refurbished. The bathroom was nicely redone, but the sink stopper didn't work and at one point later in the day there was no hot water.Everything else about this hotel was excellent. Very good location if you want to be near Fanueil Hall, Aquarium, etc. Staff was courteous, professional, friendly and helpful. The little disappointments did not take much away from an overall great experience.Side note: As a frequent Priceline customer, every now and then I get a sneaky suspicion that I'm being treated like a 2nd class citizen (although our good experiences outweigh the not-so-good). I suspected that perhaps we COULD have been assigned to a non-smoking room with double beds, but being Priceline customers, we were given one of the b-list rooms.

"hotel_189","hotel_8734","Don't stay there ever! My sister and I just came back from a two day trip to Boston. We booked the Hilton Financial District through Priceline for $100 a night. We got to the hotel around 1:30pm, after a 4 hour trip from New York, and was politely told by the front desk, that no room was available yet, because they were booked last night. So we had to come back at 3pm, which was to be expected, if it wasn't for the fact that when we did make it back to the hotel at around 3:15pm, there was a 30 min. wait in line to check in! And they had four staff working at the desk. I am not quite sure what kind of issues people were having because our check in literally took less than five minute. Once we got the key cards, and get into the room, we could not believe how tiny the room was! We arranged for a room with two double beds. There was barely enough room to leave the luggage on the floor. Nevermind that there was no desk, or a couch. We brought lunch back to the hotel, and had to eat at the wide sill, since that was the only solution without having to eat on the bathroom vanity.The same evening, we discovered that there was no hot water in the building, and when we called the front desk, we were told that they had no idea when it might come back on. Eventually later that night, the hot water came back on, but it was off again the next morning. Also if I had known better I wouldn't have bidded on the Downtown Boston area, because during the weekend, it's a ghost town, luckily it's walkable to Quincy Market. I usually wouldn't complain about Priceline hotels, since they are such good deal, but the Hilton Fiancial District definitely does not deserve a four star rating.

"hotel_189","hotel_4500","Won't stay here again!!! Our experience at the Hilton was not so great. We made our reservation back in April which at that time it was the Wyndham. I made the reservation directly through the Wyndham website and become a member of Wyndham by request which gave me certain perks such as a snack and drink on arrival, free internet, free local calls and long distance calls, plus 500 frequent flyer miles. I booked the room as a DELUXE two bed room, 460 square feet.......Well, when we arrived, if not for a very nice person from Boston to help us out, we wouldn't have found the hotel because it was now a HILTON. I was never notified in anyway of such a change. We were first given a room so tiny that you could barely squeeze past the 2 double beds. THIS WAS NOT A 460 square foot room! We had a family of 5!! This was all stated on my reservation confirmation print-out which luckily I had with us. The front desk argued with us in giving us a larger room and stated that there would be an extra $75 charge per night for the larger room. We argued right back and were willing to go to the room and measure it to see that it indeed was NOT 460 square feet---we estimated it at being approximately 250 square feet and that's being generous. We could never get a roll away bed in there for our third child. FINALLY, after the front desk person belittled me a bit by saying that 'most people--98%, who are not in the travel industry do not know how to book rooms properly over the internet and this was bascially my fault', we were given a suite which had plenty of room for our family at no additional charge. Also, we were NOT given the perks I mentioned earlier. This was not the greatest way to start out our visit to Boston and I personally will not stay at a Hilton ever again. I would like to say to this front desk person---if so many people are inept at making reservations over the internet---then why offer this service?

I must say I've driven in many big cities: New York, Philly, WashintonDC but Boston was the most challenging for me. Poor signage, windy roads, tunnels, one-ways  pedestrians darting into the street made me a little on-edge. On to the hotel...Here's what I liked about the hotel:1. Location is great. You can walk to many of the attractions. Beautiful, clean area. 2. Valet, front counter staff friendly and helpful with directions and questions during check-in.3. Quick and efficient service at the lounge/restaurant. Food was above average. Try the strawberry rhubarb dessert! Yum.4. For the business portion we had a dinner in the meeting room. The dinner and service from catering was also above average. A few things I didn't like about the hotel which I see others wrote about are:1. Dark, dingy rooms. I stayed in 1034. I didn't mind the view was a brick wall but as a result it received very little natural light. I little difficult to get good lighting to see anything.2. Housekeeping. I left my room in the morning to go to the conference. I came back to drop off brochures, etc at 1:00pm. The room had not been cleaned. I went for lunch, visited with some friends and came back at 4:00pm to grab my walking map. The room had not been cleaned. I came back to change for dinner at 6:00pm to find my room 'cleaned'. He/She flipped the covers back over the bed and (OF COARSE) took the $10 tip and the pad with 'Thank You' written on it. I couldn't believe it! It made me wonder if the sheets had been changed before my arrival??? The ironing board was left out (I took it out to iron a shirt) and the towels in the bathroom were left on the floor. So much for tipping the housekeeping staff for good service. Perhaps the reason for a dark dingy room? I mentioned the problem to the front desk person on check out. He advised me that I needed to fill out a customer satisfaction card. I said I'm telling him for the hotel's benefit not so I can vent/complain. He again, politely, urged me to fill in the card. I didn't and left to catch my flight. Probably many good, hard-working housekeepers in this hotel but where is the management to ensure quality?

Never tried the bar/restauarnt but always looked like a good place for a drink.","Feb 26, 2006","5","4",5,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_7268","Fab Hotel and Location We stayed at the Wyndham for 5 nights in Feb, and could find nothing at all to complain about. The room we had was very spacious, with a really comfy bed. The staff were really courteous and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. This hotel's location is great and is a great base for getting around the city. I would recommend a city trolley tour which was really interesting and you could get on and off wherever you wanted too. If you do go in Feb, make sure you take plenty of warm clothing as when we were there the temperature was well below freezing the whole time.","Feb 19, 2006","5","3",5,6,1,5,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_10248","Great Location I stayed at the Wyndham 1 night in Feb '06. I was able to take advantage of a great package that is not really published on their web page. Its call the fun package which is really meant for families. However after looking at all the options, even though it was only me and my boyfriend it was still a great deal. The room was 189 and it included an executive suite. This was an amazing room. We were on the top floor. You entered the room to a huge living room with small sink and counter then turned the corner to an even bigger room. We were very amazed at the size of the room and took plenty of pictures to show everyone. Also included with the package was a late check-out of 3 pm. Now for the best part, we got 4 tix for the aquarium (2 adults/2 kids), 4 breakfast buffet (2 adults/ 2 kids), popcorn and an hour of playstation. We were at the very top floor so noise was not a problem. The parking was hefty at $36 but you can take the car in and out as many times as you want for the one fee. The restaurant on site was not that great but there is plenty of other stuff around you. It really is within walking distance to just about anywhere you want to go. I found the staff to be very helpful, I got in at 12 and my room was ready and I was allowed to check in then. I would suggest this place for people that are looking to go to the aquarium, the marketplace and are not afraid to get on a train or bus to copley or the other areas of Boston. If not then maybe you should go to a hotel closer to where you want to sight see. One last thing, the taxis are not that expensive. I took one from the Wyndham to the Museum of Fine Arts and it was $12. Good luck in your travels.","Feb 6, 2006","13","10",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_3384","Enjoyed the Wyndham I found the Wyndham to be a nice hotel overall and I consider it a solid 4 star property. Please note: this hotel participates in Priceline (got it for $75) and in Hotwire so definitely check those sites out if you're looking for a deal. Positives: Lobby area is beautiful Rooms are clean and richly decorated in traditional decor Room service food was good (though overpriced)Staff was kind and welcoming Negatives: Location is good but not ideal... it is between South Station and Downtown Crossing and thus good for business travellers but not quite as ideal for leisure travellersHousekeeping banged on our door 2 times in the morning (they came once at 9 am, I asked them to come back after 12 and they came back at 11 once again) Overall, the Wyndham is a solid choice.","Feb 4, 2006","8","6",6,6,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_4492","Wyndham Boston- Would avoid The hotel is quite nice, and the front desk was sweet if somewhat befuddled.Initial room in the non-smoking floor smelled of recently smoked pot. Not the hotel's fault, but disconcerting. Back to the front dest, and was given room 412. Not bad, until the boom boom boom of disco-esque music from Umbria across the street. This continued until 2AM, when the hordes of Paris Hilton wannabees let out, and it was not until 2:30 that we got any sleep. I was too frustrated to change the room again.If you stay here, check out the room carefully. Quite honestly, the best thing to do is not stay here, since they weren't up front about an issue that is known to them.Please feel free to email me.","Jan 29, 2006","7","6",3,3,1,4,1,3,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_1177","No parking, treated like a second class citizen Just checked into the Wyndham Boston (literally) and was given a room with two double beds. While this may not seem bad, it started with finding the place. Which is down some dark alley, not to mention there is no parking, only valet service (for $36 a night). When greeted by the front desk, they did not ask us what room preference we had (probably because they had none) as well as would not give us mileage plus miles because we booked through hotwire.I have to say this is ridiculous since we have hotwired many rooms all over the world through hotwire and was able to receive our miles anyways (for instance, the Hyatt in Boston; both the one in near Chinatown and Logan). I did verify on their website that we can't get them because of this, but also they gave us the crappiest of the crap for rooms. It's small, there is a view of a brick wall and our lock is broken. Luckily the internet works or I wouldn't have been able to write this review. Anyway, when I called down right when we got the room to let them know it was two double beds and we would like a queen or king room. They requestioned me to ask if we were the ones who booked through hotwire. Then she changed her answer automatically to There are no kings available. I asked for a queen to find out their hotel only has rooms with two doubles or one king. What kind of hotel is this? Are we in Boston or not? Anyway, I advise against booking with them. Oh and not to mention I agree with another reviewer, the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything going on in the hallways. I forgot to mention that when we hotwired the room, I found out we really weren't getting much of a discount to be treated the way we were because their rates were going for $119 a night and we paid $114. Big difference right? Well in the mean time, that hallway noise is pretty nice at 2:45 in the morning, because we not only heard people coming back to their rooms then, we had loud knocking at our door. When we didn't answer (I thought it was a dream), they started banging again. We answered Hello and they said oh woops...teehhehehee. It was a bunch of drunk girls that couldn't find their room.On top of this I noticed the bathroom sink had toothpaste splattered all over the faucets and apparently no one felt the need to clean it up. Then this morning I go to get in the shower only to have the knob turned ALL the way until it can't go any further and I got lukewarm water dribbling out. It had a Waterpick head that either gave you three dripping streams, one light wide spraying rain, or five more powerful than the other sprays. And lastly, they dropped off our bill in the morning, only to charge us more fees such as convention tax, city AND state occupancy and some other room charge. Which we will obviously have to go down and talk to them about because all fees other than parking we're supposed to be paid for already through hotwire.Ugh....that's about it. Never again will I stay at any Wyndham!","Jan 25, 2006","20","10",3,3,1,3,1,2,1,"4","$322"

Mightily chilly in Boston in early January, bitter icy wind, so their thermal lights at the entrance were most welcome!! Toasty warm while waiting for car/taxi/deciding where to go.

"hotel_189","hotel_6883","Great Position Large rooms Small Beds Stayed here three nights. Rooms are large with surprisingly high ceilings well decorated but disappointingly small beds (4ft) for a USA hotel. Staff helpful if slightly distant but better than normal for a large inner city chain hotel.We were on 12th floor and still had quite a lot of traffic and pedestrian noise especially Friday night. At the moment ask for a room on the opposite side from Broad street as there is a large building on the other side of the Broad Street just being finished off and the work starts early. Last night spoilt by inconsiderate guests making a lot of noise in the corridor.Join the Wyndham By Request Club you get free phone calls local and national(mainland USA), free internet access, welcome drinks and snack(you specify in your preferences). Hotel has a great position for Quincy market, Fanueil Hall, Aquarium, Downtown area and North Side Italian resturants. Walkable to Boston Common but you would want to take the T (underground) to Theatre district and Backbay shopping area.Parking can be a problem $35 a day if you use the valet parking. Solved this by using all night $7 deal at the Post Office Square underground car park (in before 4pm out before 8am) and the earlybird daytime deal at the multistorey car park at the Aquarium $17 (in before 8.30am out by 7pm) both these are within a couple of blocks of the hotel and driving in this area is much improved since the majority of the big dig is now finished and surface trafic is reduced.There are also some 1 and 2 hour slots to the rear of the hotel and two hour parking meters.

"hotel_189","hotel_9189","Mediocre hotel; good value I recently stayed 2 nights at the Wyndham while visiting Boston for leisure. As the other reviews on this website suggested, by joining Wyndham-by-Request, I got a fantastic last-minute rate (nearly a 60% discount to all comparable hotels).Being unfamiliar with the roads in Boston, it was difficult to locate the hotel (even my GPS was confused by all the road closures). The valet parking was expensive ($36 per night), and it took a LONG time to retrieve my car- apparently the garage is 4 blocks away. For seeing the city by foot/taxi, the location is wonderful, as it is a 3-min walk to Quincy Market and also to the waterfront (where the bus tours start from).Inside the hotel, it is clean and very quiet (this is not the place to be if you want bustling action). The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. Beware of the breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant- it was arguably the worst I've ever had.The hotel room was extremely spacious and clean, but slightly barren with very little natural sunlight. The amenities were great (bathrobes, coffee, iron, bath products, Internet, cordless phone, Aeron, etc). I called to confirm a late checkout on the morning of my departure, but I was denied because it was apparently first-come-first-serve and I asked too late -- even though I specifically requested this when I made my booking.In all, I would say that this hotel is at the low end of the 4* range. However, the rates are unbeatable and therefore make it a good value for the money.","Nov 14, 2005","5","4",6,5,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"

"hotel_189","hotel_9334","Great Weekend at the Wyndham Perfect weather and a beautiful spacious room at the conveniently-located Wyndham in Boston. It was a girls' weekend in the city and we started it out  stylin'  at the Wyndham. Our room had a cool view of the clocktower and a round building (although we never did find out what that building is). The Financial District is a bit quiet on the weekends and all of the little deli's closed up on Friday afternoon so be aware of that if you just want a quick sandwich. Faneuil Hall is 2 blocks away though and there are quite a few bars and restaurants within a block or two. The Wyndham service was good but you do pay for them to book you a tour for instance - $2.50 a ticket for a service fee? They also did not tell you they were charging you for the service fee, so be aware if you are booking multiple trips. Go to Faneiul Hall to book these things - they don't charge a cent. No vending machines for soda in the hotel - you have to get room service, which of course is expensive. Martini's in the lobby bar were $13 - although it was very good. I signed up for the Wyndham by Request and did get a welcome snack and the other small things but they would not honor the free breakfast buffet without the internet coupon, which was disappointing because the buffet is $16.50 a person - we did not get the buffet but got breakfast at Caliterra and it was very good.

I'm a Rewards member and I was updated to an executive suite.

The buffet is a full breakfast (all you can eat style), everything you could want and very nice service.I think I paid around $100 w/tax each night - it's normally close to $200. Not too many complaints - drunks in street below (many pubs nearby), dim lights in bathroom and vanity, sitting area near bar by the door was a little dusty and couch could have used a steam clean, but still ok. Once they know you are a rewards member, you get better service. Doormen/bellhops were very nice, too. The restaurant outside of breakfast is not too great - overpriced California? gourmet or really, they're just trying to get creative and it doesn't really work too well.

Yes, parking would be difficult (as in any large metropolitan city) but it wasn't necessary to have a car.

"hotel_189","hotel_9114","Our Second Stay Here---In Most Ways, Better than the First We decided to stay at the Wyndham again because we like its proximity to the Aquarium T station which is helpful when flying into Logan. This time, when we made our reservations, only suites were available. While, I'm sure we could have found a cheaper room elsewhere, we decided to stick with the Wyndham. When we checked in, we were pleased to find that our suite was on the top floor with a great view. Plus, it was much quieter than our last stay mainly because we didn't face any bars or clubs. The suites are nice here. There is a sitting room with a wet bar like area and a TV. The bedroom also has a TV. Also, there are 2 bathrobes in the bathroom and an umbrella in the bedroom closet. We're Wyndham by Request members so we got a welcome food tray which isn't as nice at this Wyndham---only a few crackers and some rondele spread but can't complain. The one thing we didn't particularly like was the housekeeping. The strangest thing was that the maid would not take the tip we left for her! I called the front desk about it and they said to bring it to them. When we did, they put it in an envelope and wrote our room number on it. The next day, we arrived back at the hotel just as the maid was finishing up in our suite. Again, I noticed she didn't take the tip so I handed it to her. She also didn't replenish the toiletries, we later discovered, leaving us with only one used bar of soap. When we checked out, we didn't leave a tip. Given the fact that the maid didn't take her tips, we didn't see the point of leaving one since it would be the next people who stayed in the room that would get it. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and helpful. We only ate breakfast one day at the hotel restaurant. You can do so much better elsewhere pricewise.

"hotel_189","hotel_7559","Excellent choice The Wyndham Boston was excellent. Without my mention of it, the front desk clerk noticed that it was my birthday during our stay and upgraded us to a suite. Very nice touch (although admittedly we were paying a relatively high rate...the hotel's prebooking discount rate, which was about 50% higher than was to be had on a discounted hotel site like expedia). The concierge was very helpful with anything that we needed. The room was nice, about what you'd expect in a 4 star hotel in a major city. We were on a high floor, away from any local bar noise (and there are several bars close by). The hotel is convenient to the Aquarium as well as Quicy/Faneuil Halls. North End with excellent dining is a short walk away. An excellent location choice is you are OK with not staying in Back Bay/near Copley Plaza.Oh, and parking is very easy, contrary to the previous review from the NY traveller. Valet is the only way to go in a big city downtown hotel. The cost is usually about the same as self park anyway typically. I'm not sure that the hotel warrants a 2/5 rating because the traveller decided not to just go park at the hotel.","Jul 17, 2005","20","13",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_8546","A Nice Place to Stay for Tourists I was happy with the location of the hotel. It is a short walk to Quincy Market which can satisfy anyone's dining needs (fast food or sit down) and a short walk to the Aquarium where you can catch one of several tour trolly tours. All the tours except the Boston Duck Tours seem to start near the aquarium and there are also harbor tours at the wharf.It is easy to catch the T (subway) either at Government Center or at State.Even walking to the North End and grabbing something to eat on Hanover Street wasn't too far. We ate at Pomodoro which had great food. And we tried pastries at a couple cafe's but I have to admit the Mike's Pastry was the best.There are plenty of places to catch a quick breakfast from Dunkin Donuts to small mom and pop cafe's near the hotel. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was that there was:1) no in-room safe (don't all hotels have safes?!?) 2) Only three small drawers for clothes3) A closet which was not enclosed4) Our room was always dark since the room was facing the other side of the hotel (hotel is like a shape of a U and the room was not facing the street, it was on the inner side), but then again we got a cheap rate.5) We had to request 3 extra pillows since pillows not fluffy6) At night on weekends there are lots of bars all over the place especially near Quincy Market so sometimes the crowds spill onto the sidewalks but we never ran into any crazy drunks. But at times we had to walk to the other side of the street or on the street to avoid the crowds but only on Friday and Sat.Overall though we spent 5 nights here and we had no problem getting to all parts of the city and we did have a nice stay here.

"hotel_189","hotel_3141","Wow I left a sparkling review for this hotel earlier but I forgot to mention one important thing. I was so excited to start sightseeing the day after we checked in that I accidently left my wallet with several hundred dollars in it, not to mention my checkbook and credit cards, in my room on the nightstand. I didn't even realize that I had left it there until I returned to the room and saw my wallet sitting there. I was afraid to look inside because I did this in Mexico and they left me $3. I was so impressed when all my money was still there. Thank you to a very honest housekeeping person. A tip: the elevators don't work until you slide your card through. I reported a broken elevator to the front desk my first day. OOPS! And I read someone complained about the unfriendly doorman. We had 2 doormen in our 3 days and they were overly friendly and helpful, as was every person we encountered there. We also signed up for the Wyndham by Request and that is a great thing!! They had a bottle of Cabernet waiting for us in the room and a plate of chocolate chip cookies for the kids. Our room was $249 a night but included breakfast buffets for 5 each morning ($60 value) and 4 2-day goboston passes ($220 value) WHICH ARE A DEAL! We practically got paid to stay here! A great value in any book!! My husband dropped us off at the hotel and returned the rental car since we knew it was expensive to park and we planned on walking or using the T. This actually was difficult for my husband since driving in Boston is complicated. We found the hotel easily. Finding his way back to the Thrifty car rental place in Revere was more challenging. He eventually found it, by driving to the airport and following the Thrifty shuttle to Revere and then he took the T back to the hotel and said that was easy. All around a fabulous place to stay. Very comfy beds and I loved the robes! I used it every day!!","Jun 29, 2005","12","9",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_2845","A great hotel We booked through Hotwire. We really didn鈥檛 have a clue about hotels in Boston and there was so much - too much 鈥?choice. So when we saw a 4* hotel on Hotwire, with three rave user-reviews and in a central location, booking seemed a good idea. We weren鈥檛 disappointed. My husband travels a lot for business, usually in 4* hotels, and even he was very pleased with the Wyndham.Every member of staff we dealt with was excellent. They obviously choose and train them well. I think our room must have been one of the smaller ones mentioned in other reviews as it certainly wasn鈥檛 huge but it was more than ample for the two of us and had a wonderful king bed with lots of pillows and a very comfortable firm mattress..  We weren鈥檛 facing the building work so can鈥檛 comment on the noise as we didn鈥檛 hear any. We appreciated our glimpse of the harbour and airport island between the buildings opposite as the sun on the water and the sunrise was so pretty. Of all our New England hotels, the Boston Wyndham had the quietest air conditioning. Something that became very clear to us as we travelled as it set too high a standard. We spent a few sleepless nights yearning to be back at the Wyndham!The housekeeping service was immaculate. It really couldn鈥檛 be faulted on any day in any way.Both the desk chair and armchair were very comfy.As Dara Metteucci, (the ByRequest Manager), informed us, we didn鈥檛 qualify for Wyndham-By-Request as we鈥檇 booked through Hotwire. However, Dara, still made sure we received the non-smoking room we required (I have asthma) and we were made to feel that nothing would be too much trouble. Excellent service.One of the best things though had to be the location 鈥?it really couldn鈥檛 be beat. Close to Quincy Hall, the Aquarium, the Freedom Trail, two T-stations, numerous food and drink possibilities 鈥?what more could we have wanted? I've justifiably given 5* but we did have a couple of minor gripes. The first being the towel situation. There weren鈥檛 any by the vanities. You had to wash your hands in one room, then run dripping to another to dry them in the bathroom 鈥?which didn鈥檛 have enough towel rails anyway... not very 4*.I had to take things out of the advertised fridge in order to put anything in it. But if you鈥檙e looking for a well-stocked mini bar, the Wyndham鈥檚 your hotel!Would we stay at the Boston Wyndham again? Most definitely. In a heartbeat.","Jun 27, 2005","16","9",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_3008","Good hotel in financial district For a recent three-day weekend trip, the Wyndham was exactly what we expected for the price; a clean, good-sized room, polite staff and a great location in the Financial District for exploring the city on foot. I wouldn't want to drive or park there, but for walking around to the famous sites like Quincy Market, the North End and over to the Back Bay, its location was excellent. Five blocks to a T stop and the wharf where the harbor cruises leave, it made for a very nice long weekend. We didn't try the restaurant outside of one room service breakfast which was delivered quickly and was delicious. While it wasn't anything that bothered us, this is a city hotel and there is ambient noise outside at night that might bother you if you aren't used to the city. A few pubs around the hotel had good crowds on the weekend we were there, and if music from them drifted up to our room on the 15th floor, I imagine it was louder below us. Just something to keep in mind if you don't live in or regularly stay in a city environment.","Jun 26, 2005","9","6",4,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_7572","Wonderful service, great location The staff at this hotel is wonderful, we had been in an accident and called to cancel our reservation. They offered to refund our money despite the fact that the reservation was for that day and it was a non-refundable internet deal. The next morning we decided to go on our trip anyway and rebooked with the hotel (getting an even cheaper rate than before). We arrived before check-in time so they held our bags and wished us a wonderful day. The staff was quick to provide us with walking or driving instructions that were easy to understand and everyone was very pleasant. We had only two complaints. The weather had turned sharply colder that day and we returned to a freezing hotel room. They were having an AC problem and couldn't warm the building up so they sent up extra blankets that were toasty warm. My other complaint is that if you are a small eater or have children look elsewhere for breakfast as it is very expensive here. My daughters loved their waffles and stuffed french toast but the buffet was very small for the price. This was our most expensive meal of the trip and we ate at nice resturants all week.This hotel is a bit trickey to get too since it is in the middle of the massive road work going on but arriving on a Sunday helped with the traffic situation. But it's location is wonderful for sightseeing since it is 3 blocks from Fanuiel Hall and the Aquarium. We walked everywhere and being it was so late when we returned to our hotel we used a taxi rather than the T.This is a wonderful hotel and with internet rates we managed to get a room for $161 on a weekend. We will most definitely stay here again.","Jun 26, 2005","12","8",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_9343","Enjoyed the Wyndham We spent four nights at the Wyndham. Had a lovely big room. Corner view with a plethora of windows. Comfy bed. High floor as asked for in Wyndham by Request. Tea and Coffee a in room a lovely change from most American hotels. Bar was nice. Friendly service. Check in courteous and efficient, just what you neeed after a seven hour flight. Brilliant location. Perfect for an early morning walk to the sea. Please please eat and drink at Mr Dooleys bar next door. Truly superb. A proper Irish bar. Really enjoyed everything about Boston.","Jun 25, 2005","5","4",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_10308","Really Nice Hotel Pros: The location was great - very close to Quincy Market and the waterfront. It was easy to walk to and from the T station and the neighborhood was safe and well lit. Everything went really smooth at this hotel. We prepaid and booked our rooms early. No hassles or mistakes at check in or check out. It couldn't have gone smoother. I joined the Wyndham By Request club prior to going and had extra towels and snacks in the room when we checked in. We also got the use the late checkout because we had joined their club (it was free to join). The elevators were quick and there were plenty of them. The room itself was huge. We had a standard room with 2 double beds. We were in a corner room so maybe it was bigger than most but we had so much room. You could have easily fit 2 additional double beds in our room and still had room to walk around. The bathroom was big and clean. Free newspaper every morning is left outside your door. The front desk people were very helpful - when I asked about buying a 3-day subway pass, they asked me if we were really going to use the subway that much. They explained the price and asked if we were going to be walking alot or really using the subway. Turned out, it was much cheaper for us to pay as we went and not buy the pass, because we did so much walking! Cons: No in-room safe, not enough drawers to store clothes. The room probably seemed so big because there was no storage in the room. Parking at the hotel is really expensive. There seemed to only be one valet and when we got there, we waited out front for about 5 minutes and no one was around. It was pretty fortunate because we ended up parking a few blocks away at a public lot for less than the hotel was going to charge us - and we had full access to our car anytime we wanted it. We didn't use the room service - with so many bars and pubs and the market nearby, we didn't want to eat at the hotel. Overall, this was a very nice hotel. I would stay there again if I could get the same deal I got this time (by pre-paying and booking in advance). Everyone was really nice.","Jun 23, 2005","11","10",4,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"

A visit to the Caliterra restaurant is well worthwhile with good food, portions and staff.Tried to get Red Sox tickets since April unsuccessfully.

"hotel_189","hotel_6901","Great hotel! We had a great weekend stay at the Wyndham. Wyndham By Request is the way to go--definitely sign up! The location was great, I don't know what people are talking about in the reviews that say it's dead on the weekends. There are plenty of bars in the neighborhood (we didn't have any problem at all with noise, either, as mentioned in other reviews) and it really is a quick walk to pretty much everything. Boston is such a great walking city! I always tend to look around at other hotels when I go places to see if I would do anything differently after I know the city a bit better, and I didn't see any hotel that seemed more appealing. I would definitely stay at the Wyndham for my next trip to Boston.","Jun 14, 2005","11","9",5,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_1524","Nice Hotel, great location The Wyndham is a very nice hotel that has an excellent location by the harbor. The Hotel has an old Boston look and feel but rooms blend in modern amenities. Small front desk, check in went smooth. Bell hops and cabs waiting for you at the door.My first impression was the room was small. The comfortable king bed seemed to take up half the room. This hotel was built well before the age of mega suite hotels, and it wasn't bad at all. Everything is nicely renovated, I believe recently.Wyndham by Request had a bottle of beer on ice, snack, extra feather pillows, room on a high floor that I could smoke in, that was away from the elevators, and a local newspaper (even the $2.50 Sunday Globe)..all exactly as I selected on their web site, and all free.The work desk was decent and functional and the ergo chair is just like you have at most offices. Wireless phone and ethernet on desk.Free phone calls, high speed internet, bottled water and coffee, nice. Contrary to one review, the rooms do have drawers to put your clothes in! You can also open up a window if you like and hear the city (it's quiet on the weekends though). No in room safe, in the basic room at least. It's good that the elevator won't let you punch a floor without putting in your key first.The view was of historic buildings in front of a modern skyscraper, as well as the harbor where you could see boats and Logan airport.Room service has good food and is prompt. Make sure you're ready to open the door 5 minutes after you order breakfast!Maid service does a nice job, refreshes everything. I think you must hang the service room tag on the knob or they won't come in. Bathroom has nice marble tile and strong shower head, big clean tub.I went to the restaurant on site, Caliterra, and just had something at the bar since the restaurant is closed after breakfast till dinner. It was the best bar food around and a good indicator of what a dinner must be like. They give you a mystery discount envelope to the restaurant upon checkin that is good for anywhere from 10 to 100 percent off a meal.Concierge has a map and will hand draw you directions to get started.You can walk to many pubs and restuarants VERY easily and safely. Fanuel Hall marketplace nearby has nice restaurants that do seafood in a Boston way. Go to McCormick  Schmick's and order a 1.25 lb lobster and a bowl of clam chowder and you'll know what I mean. Tour boothes all over the marketplace for duck boat, big harbor boats, trolleys, etc. The aquarium is near, look for the rockhopper penquins, sea lions and a 60 year old sea turtle. The area is also great for young singles on Fri and Sat nights.The Freedom trail is kind of long. If you get tired just make it to the next location and a cab might be around to bail out. The hotel and Fanuel Hall are at its mid point. Bunker Hill at the end was very interesting and you can climb up the monument, which looks like the Washington monument in DC, but much smaller. Just a fairly important note about Beantown weather, good luck! I went when it was a classic Boston hazy, hot and opressively humid weekend. Even if you're from the deep South you will hate it. The hotel a/c isn't powerful. They do get cold fronts, so if your stay is long enough one will blow through and it will be beautiful after.","Jun 14, 2005","14","10",6,5,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_6964","The Wyndham was great! We just got back from a three night stay in Boston. We stayed at the Wyndham which we would highly recommend. On the advice of other travellers in this forum we joined the Wyndham By Request scheme, and on our second day I thought it was worth asking for an upgrade as we have two teenagers and they didn't want to share the other double bed. This request was granted right away and we moved to a two room suite at no extra charge. The lifts require a card swipe to access all floors, which is an excellent security measure. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was ideally situated for the Aquarium, Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market. I'd definitely stay there again.","Jun 4, 2005","10","8",5,6,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_5389","Great place to stay We just came back from a 3 day trip to the Boston area. The location of the hotel was fine. The hotel was very friendly and aimed to please. At first, we took a different stop from the T location but found a closer one at the Aquarium. This hotel is just a few block walk from the Waterfront. We did the Old Town Trolley which was great because you could ge on and off and see different sites around Boston. We drove in from a friend's event in New Jersey and dropped off our car at the airport. We were glad we did since Boston is a very compact, walking friendly city. My son and I were able to get tickets to a Red Sox game one night which was very exciting. We had a wait in a long line for 1 1/2 hrs, but it was worth it even though they lost.

"hotel_189","hotel_5988","We will be back! Just returned from a weekend in Boston with a stay at the Wyndham. What a great find! THE best price for a GREAT room in a GREAT location. We parked our car in the Post Office Square parking garage and walked a very easy couple of blocks to the Wyndham. This saved a bundle on parking since the weekend rate at Post Office Square is only $7/day. Even though it was a wet, cool, and windy weekend in the city, we walked to Quincy Market, the North End, Filene's Basement, etc. It was a short walk to the T which we took to Fenway for a baseball game. Took a cab back to our car after the game (about $10) and worth every penny rather than standing in a looong line at the T. The breakfast at Caliterra was very good and couldn't be a better bargain with a coupon for one free buffet. The front desk staff were so helpful with directions and advice. We were upgraded to a 2-room king suite with a wonderful view looking out towards Quincy Market and North End. Our Wyndham By Request cheese and Chardonnay were waiting for us in our suite as was our customized bed. Wyndham has got the whole customer loyalty program down to a science and have won over these two very local Wyndham customers.

Very very comfortable beds, (we had 4 people in 1 room) (2 adults in 1 bed and 2 children in other bed). Marble bathroom was very large and CLEAN! Only complaint was the water pressure in the shower - (they had a note about water conservation hanging in the bathroom). The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Definately go on line and join Wyndham By Request, it is totally free and offers you various choices for your stay (extra towels, late check out, welcome snack, etc.). We did not have the best weather, 3 out of the 4 days is rained, but we kept busy our entire stay! Hotel is really in great location - convenient to Quincey Market and the T - which is easy to follow and takes you everywhere (alot cleaner then NY subway). Our highlight of the trip was the Duck Tours - they book up quickly but really try and book ahead if possible!) We were recommended to try a restaurant in the North End called Artu - food was absolutely delicious, tasted homemade and a wonderful menu. After dinner go to Mike's down the street for pastries, again, you may have to wait in line, but worth the wait because this bakery is really good. For the price, the Wyndham was a wonderful hotel.

"hotel_189","hotel_4448","Better than we expected-parking garage info.. We recently stayed at the Wyndham Boston 2 weekends in a row and dont understand how anyone could write bad reviews on this hotel. First of all if you plan on staying here definitly join the Wyndham by request program. Its fantastic! We got a 2pm check out both times which was really great. The second weekend that we stayed there we got to our room and they had upgraded us to a suite without us even knowing. The rooms are really nice and its very convenient to a lot of major boston attractions. We live in Massachusetts and will continue to come back to this hotel whenever we decide to go into the city. As far as parking goes...if you dont want to pay $35 for valet parking...park at the Post Office Square Parking garage...its only $7 a day on the weekends...and its only a couple blocks away. Ask for a room on one of the top floors if you really desire a decent view. The hotel is only 15 floors so its not like you're looking over the city.

"hotel_189","hotel_6820","Good job Wyndham Boston! I recently spent an enjoyable weekend (2 nights) at the Wyndham Boston hotel. The room was very fairly priced (about $70 per night less than many comparable hotels). You should know that the area in which the hotel is located is rather quiet during the weekends since it really is the central business area for the city. That being said, Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market is only a short walk away. I was promptly (they were almost tripping over each other to help me!) greeted in a friendly manner. The room was very spacious and clean. In fact, it appears to have been recently renovated (or they just do an incredible job maintaining the rooms!). My ByRequest welcome snack of fresh fruit and diet soda was very generous (a banana, apple, orange, pear and strawberries along with two bottles each of soda and water - all this for free!). The hotel was very quiet and I enjoyed 2 peaceful nights of rest. The hotel manager called the first day we were there to see if there was anyway she could do to help us/improve our stay...what a very nice touch! My only complaint is about housekeeping after the first night. The housekeeper forget (I presume) to leave new soap and facecloths. Otherwise, the room was very clean. I highly recommend this hotel to you and can't wait to return myself! Oh, and Boston is a great city too!","Feb 28, 2005","2","2",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_10322","Good choice - by Boston standards (I say by Boston standards because lodging is ridiculously expensive in Boston for what you often get. If it wasn't for Hotwire, I probably would have opted for a cheaper hotel...we paid $119 + $20 tax; a bargain for a 4-star hotel.)  I work in Boston and we live about 30 miles away; this wasn't so much for sightseeing (though the location is great - near the Aquarium and Faneuil Hall) as it was having a romantic pre-Valentine's weekend in the city. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the area around the Aquarium had become more visitor-friendly and had restaurants, bars, etc. and that the place didn't become eerily deserted on the weekend. If, like us, you're somewhat local, here's a tip: park at an MBTA station and take the train in. Otherwise, it's $35 to park a car that you won't be driving while you're in Boston.  Also, don't assume that those bottles of water in your room are complimentary - we drank a 16 oz. bottle before realizing that they were $3.50 apiece.   This was a very clean, nicely decorated, and quiet room on the 9th floor (may not be the case during the week as the room faced a construction site). The staff were all pleasant and helpful. My only real gripe was that room service knocked on our door twice - to deliver food for the people next door. (Honestly, the room numbers are posted right on the wall!) Each time - once late at night and the other time, early in the morning - they woke us up. But it wasn't worth complaining about.  We didn't sample Caliterra (the restaurant downstairs), but we had the Financier's Breakfast (eggs/toast/bacon/hash browns + juice + tea or coffee) for $11.50 apiece...a bargain compared to the a la carte cereal ($4) or other items. But after factoring in tax, $3 delivery charge and 16% gratuity, you're better off wandering down the street to have brunch in one of the local restaurants.","Feb 13, 2005","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_4341","Beautiful hotel and central to everything! Ok, if I hadn't had a couple of problems in the booking process, I'd say the stay was excellent. But somehow a booking for the internet rates for 2 nights and 1 night of special family package got a bit discombobulated. A deluxe room came with the family package, and I signed up for the hotel's club too, to get any upgrades I could. So I paid for a 3 night stay, which got billed wrong, so I should have noticed it when I saw the original billing, cuz I paid what I was supposed to, but it said 3 nights internet plan. But when we got there, they had it in their notes that I had the family plan, and gave us a deluxe room on the top floor, with all the club upgrades, and didn't deliver any of the package deals with it. Weird. So I was complaining that although the room was nice and HUGE, and we had two small kids there spreading out all their toys and clothes, that there was no tickets to the aquarium, and that we were supposed to get a free breakfast. They said they'd credit us back the price of the aquarium tickets, so to go ahead and buy them cuz they were out of vouchers, and they'd credit them. Then, they gave us the tickets to the breakfast. Then my girlfriend wanted a rollaway bed, and they gave it to us for free in the end when the on demand movies went out on us, and we were all set to watch a movie. We wanted our popcorn and drinks too, and they kept saying they had it in their notes that we were only supposed to get the internet rate, and couldn't understand what was going on. I was having a headache explaining it over and over again to at least 5 people. I was getting half the stuff, and not everything. And then they kept saying that I got all these things for free, and I was saying that 'NO, I paid for them, it comes with the package I paid for. In the end, we got most of it, or the equivalent. But I do need to mention that the rooms were really nice, and clean, and although there was construction going on outside our window, I didn't hear a thing really, cuz we weren't in the room when they were banging away. And I thought it was pretty well insulated. It had started to snow the first day we were there - we went in mid-Nov. And it was so cool to be on the top floor and see nothing one day, and then see the rooftops filled with snow the next morning. We were SO close to the aquarium and Faneuil, it made it bearable when we were walking with toddlers in the ice. They were so cold, but the walk was only 2-3 blocks, so I can't complain.  The food in the restaurant was phenomenal for dinner. I treated myself to a nice dinner, and it was really good. The breakfasts are more costly, so I'm glad it ended up being free. I had heard it was expensive to eat in Boston, but it wasn't any more than other places I've traveled to.   OH - special mention! We tried a Legal Sea Foods, on my brother's recommendation, and it was really good too. I saw the line and heard there was a 45 minute wait, and wasn't sure what to do. We didn't know of anyplace close by, and figured on walking somewhere else, then turned back and went in anyhow. The host saw us with the two small kids, freezing and hungry, and I guess he took pity on us, and while he told us we would have to wait at least 45 minutes, he came over within 10 minutes and gave us a corner table in the far back of the restaurant. We gladly took it, it was perfect. It even had extra room in back of us for us to throw all our shopping bags and strollers so they were out of the way of everyone. They must save that table for families. I can't speak more highly of that host, and should have tipped him!! But this is the location right next to the aquarium, and I didn't expect any special courtesies, but they were sure family friendly. they also had great kids menus. Anyhow, sorry I digress....  The hotel was so close to the restaurant though, that if you stay there, and you have a family to feed, that's the place to go that won't break the bank, and had great food, and was convenient and friendly.  Hotel staff was overall courteous, and the guys out in front are wonderful, and always got a taxi quickly, and helped us pack our car when we left. Man, they're awesome! They got a tonload of stuff, ice chest, luggage, stroller, all back into a small trunk. Previously, we had to put the stroller in the front, which was not comfortable. I don't know how the guy did it, but boy, we were sure happy when he got it all to fit. We didn't dare open it for any reason other than when my girlfriend dropped me and my daughter off at the airport.  I'd definitely go back again. But this time I know not to try and combine packages. I'd just do either the package, or the internet rates. It's probably myfault for the mess, and I gotta admit I was stressing during some of the stay, but I think it was partially my fault. And they did try to make good on everything. So, a 5 rating goes to effort on their parts - but they need a better booking system.","Feb 9, 2005","6","5",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_10527","Noisy but nice Got a great deal, $78 per night through hotwire. The room was nice, well appointed, but the revelers in the room next door were very loud, the walls were painfully thin, I could hear the TV in detail. When they checked out another group of noisies checked in. We could also hear the vacum cleaner outside our room in the hallway at 8 am.That said, though, the location is perfect, walking distance to 3 different T stations, Faneuil Hall, even walked to North End, took about 15 minutes. You need a room key to use the elevator, which made me feel safe in my room and in the hotel lobby late at night.","Jan 6, 2005","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_7495","Ab - Fab!.... Well worth it!....The place to stay in Boston... This hotel and it's staff can be simply described as - FANTASTIC!. It is the best hotel we as a family have stayed in to date. It's location in guides may be a little missleading BUT I can assure you it's location makes it the ideal spot for shopping and sightseeing. Easy access to public transport network and particularily the Subway.Although this was booked as part of a package via Virgin/Trailfinders- it is well worth registering with 'Wyhndam By Request' via thier website. This allows you to taylor the room to your personal requirements. Stock the mini-bar with all your favourites. Free internert access for your laptop  free telephone calls within the US. You will also have FREE snacks and welcome drinks, free newpapers and the personal attention of a 'By Request' Manager within the hotel who will look after your EVERY need! Rooms are superb and you will be automatically upgraded at no extra cost if a room exists on arrival!Rooms are superb- clean and very tastefully decorated.

"hotel_189","hotel_4900","Excellent hotel in convenient location. Have just returned from a 5 day December holiday in Boston with my sister - seeing the sights and visting my niece who is working there for a year. What a terrific city! Our enjoyment was enhanced by the choice of hotel, the Boston Wyndham. Location was perfect - Financial/Dowton District so quieter than some areas but very convenient for Quincy Market and Fanueil Hall and T stops to rest of Boston. The T was only 2 blocks away (2-3 minute walk) and even without the T it is easy to walk to a host of attractions - we are English so enjoy fresh air and exercise anyway! Plenty of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity.Would definitely recommend the Wyndham as a beautiful hotel, large well appointed guest rooms, friendly, helpful staff - particularly the Conceirge and Reception staff. We were first of all shown to a room which faced a construction site across the road. We were concerned about the construction noise so asked to be moved which was done immediately. Only minor criticism relates to breakfast - a well stocked buffet is available but I would recommend ordering off the menu for freshly cooked hot food. Or even better, go to Pete's Deli next door for a bagle or toasted sandwich and coffee (half the price and just as good especially if you don't feel like a large meal).Hotel bar is also a pleasant venue to relax in after a hard day on the tourist trail for a nightcap or light bar snack. Pizza and martini cocktails are particularly good.Booked Wyndham and flight with Trailfinders and got an excellent deal.","Dec 13, 2004","4","3",6,5,1,6,1,5,1,"4","$322"

We booked a Saturday night for $99 using the Entertainment Book.I informed the hotel that it was our anniversay, and when we arrived at our room after dinner, there was a bottle of Champagne on ice, chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate chip cookies, and a hand written note from the managers/staff hoping we are enjoying our stay.This hotel is a 5min. walk to Fanuil Hall, and 10min. to The North End, or Downtown crossing.It's in a very safe neighborhood.If there are any negatives, it's the lack of a pool, lack of parking,and unless you get free coupons for the breakfast buffet, it's not worth paying $16 pp.Every employee at the hotel, from Check-in - Conceirge - Housekeeping was friendly, helpful, and polite.Enjoy!","Nov 22, 2004","0","0",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_8854","great hotel we were there during the blackout 2003 We had a lovely suite with a great location to all the tourist areas. We had already checked out the day the blackout occurred and were scheduled to take a night train home. Unfortunately the trains are electric and couldn't get into New York! The staff at the Wyndham were great. They checked us back in and gave us a room with a view, helped us find out about Amtrak, etc. As it turned out the next AM there were still no trains South (and by now a lot of people had been flying into Logan because NYC was closed) but we did find out trains were running out of Manhattan South (we needed to get the Wilmington, Delaware). It was like the Amazing Race! Everyone trying to get out of town. We ended up taking a Greyhound to NYC and were able to get a train home. It cost us about an additional $1000 but it could have been worse. Only down side was the staff didn't know much about the package deal I booked which was supposed to include nightly popcorn and sodas for the kids. ALso I was charged $14.00 for a 2 min phone call home (I stupidly left my calling card at home). I would recommend this Hotel to anyone!","Nov 4, 2004","5","5",6,6,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$322"

Wyndham club service has special treats in the room all the time and would call to make sure we had everything we needed. Great, great hotel. Great location and great staff.

"hotel_189","hotel_3293","Didn't need to worry I booked three nights at the Wyndham Hotel in Boston and was concerned to read about the noise of the construction work nearby plus surrounding nightlife noise. We didn't have any problems, our room was at the back of the hotel and was as quiet as you would expect any city hotel to be(the main noise was from the external air conditioning vents). It was clean, comfortable and near to Long Wharf where we arrived by boat from the airport. It was an easy walk to Quincey's Market and to the 'T'. It was away from all the noise and hustle of the main shopping and thoroughfares, which we liked. So if you just want somewhere reasonably priced to stay and like moderate walks to key sites..I would recommend this hotel.","Oct 1, 2004","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_6673","nice. Stayed in a standard double room and found it rather small but very pleasant. Clean and plush, but rather dark and dim. The bathroom was spacious (and well lit) and much nicer than the average hotel. Our room had a view of a wall, but we were there only at nighttime so it didn't matter too much. The business center was cramped but sufficient. Late that night we ordered a couple of martinis at the bar downstairs and were surprised to find that our bill was $22 for two simple drinks-- but I suppose that's what you get at a hotel bar.

"hotel_189","hotel_5098","Average experience My family (myself, husband and 13-year old son) stayed at this hotel from Saturday, 8/14 to Monday, 8/16. We purposely went to Boston to attend a Red Sox game on Sunday afternoon. Since we had been to Boston in May of this year, we wanted to stay somewhere different to get a varied experience. After many hours searching this site and a few others, I choose this hotel mostly based on the reviews, cost and location. After booking the hotel through their website, I did find it cheaper on Expedia only a few hours later. I filled out their request form and within 2 days heard back from them that they would honor the lower price on Expedia and I would get the first night for free. All of this worked out fine and we had no problems. We opted not to rent a car since it's impossible to drive around Boston when you're not familiar, especially with the Big Dig going on. We hopped in a taxi from the airport ($30.00) and arrived at the hotel before 2:00 p.m. I wasn't sure that our room would be ready, but it was. Not only was the room ready, but because I am a WyndamByRequest member, we were upgraded ever before I asked for an upgrade.Sure, the welcome snacks weren't in the room when we arrived simply because we were there early and the room was upgraded, but they arrived right on time at 3:00 p.m. We were given a one bedroom suite so our son was able to sleep on the sofa bed and we used the large bedroom. Everything was clean.The noise from the construction across the street is not the hotel's fault. We were on the top floor (15th) and it was loud. Early in the morning, too. The hotel gives you a note in the room apologizing for the noise that will start at 7:00 a.m. and end at 3:00 p.m. From my experience, they started around 6:00 a.m. and ended around 5:00 p.m. Long day for those workers. Again, it's not the hotel's fault so I can't justify a complaint about it. Besides, we are early risers and weren't planning on staying in the hotel all day anyway.We did eat in the hotel restaurant one night. It was just OK. Not great. My husband didn't like his entree at all. My son and I had pizza. Not too bad. The waiter was wonderful and the place wasn't crowded at all. We wonder how they stay in business. It was a Saturday night and we were 3 of about 10 people in the entire restaurant.My major problem with this hotel is their location and no pool. Some people may think I'm being over-critical, but sometimes a pool is important. We were in town during the end of Hurricane Charlie and the weather wasn't good at all. A pool in the hotel would have killed a few hours for us between outings and, in this case, we really missed not having one. Also, the location wasn't great and maybe I'm being too critical again. We stayed directly across from Quincy Market during our last stay and that was great. Right in the middle of it all! This hotel is a few blocks from Quincy Market and a few blocks from the Aquarium and a few blocks from the T, etc. It's really a few blocks from almost everything. I like being closer to the sites.All in all, this hotel was average in my opinion. We travel to many different cities in the U.S. and I'm always looking for larger hotels (name brand), amentities, location and price. While this hotel really didn't do anything wrong, it wasn't one of my favorites.","Aug 23, 2004","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"
"hotel_189","hotel_3071","not what I had expected Just returned from a one night stay at the Wyndham Boston and was not impressed. We had booked the Lion King Package well over 10 months ago. As there were to be three of us I opted for a suite for an additional $75.00 bringing the total for three adults to a very expensive $673.00. This included a breakfast buffet.I have been a Wyndham by Request member for a fews years. I got not one thing I requested. First off no early check in and they were quite adamant that the room would not be ready until three o'clock period. Check in at three was very busy and the staff was not overly friendly. Proceeded to our suite which was not what we expected. There was a medium sized bedroom (king bed) and a small living space with table,four chairs, sofa (w/bed) and tv cabinet. There was a small kitchen area with a coffee maker, 2 tea bags, 1 decaf coffee, 1 reg coffee, 2 cremoras and one stirrer 2 coffee cups. Remind you there are three adults. We wondered why they even put a dining table in the room as there were no microwave, utensils, nothing. We had bought some treats from the wonderful Mike's Bakery in the North end and had to eat with our fingers. The ice machine was broken on our floor, however it was repaired in a few hours. We called downstairs for extra towels, cups, glasses and possible utensils, got the first three but no utensils. We then inquired about our complimentary beverage and snack and were told that we would receive it at 6pm. we left for the play @7:15 still nothing and nothing waiting for us on our return at 11pm. Readied ourselves for bed, holes in the pillow cases, dingy looking. Up at the crack of dawn when construction noise woke us . We were on the fifteenth floor and could still hear it. This of course is not the hotel's fault.Off to breakfast..very good buffet. Explained to hostess that our breakfast was included she nodded and we ate and upon leaving we were chased down by a waiter demanding payment. I had to go to the front desk forvouchers we never received. At the front desk was told we did not have breakfast included but free admission to the aquarium. After a while they said we did have free breakfast but for 2 adults 1 child. This took more time as I explained I had paid $149.00 extra for the third adult and another $75 for the suite and I better get breakfast paid. To get through all this I went through 3 people as these folks don't know how to multi-task (I can't do that..you'll have to see....). The Lion King was wonderful and the seats we had were great, the view from our room overlooked the harbor but the price was just to inflated for what was received. We have stayed in many Boston hotels and we will not be staying at this one again. ANd if you are looking for Lion King packages the Omni Parker House has a better deal.","Aug 17, 2004","3","3",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$322"

My family, my brothers, my sister, step Dad and Aunt all stayed at the Wyndam Hotel. The rooms were very clean and the service was excellent. All staff was friendly and attentive. A really great hotel experience - but not cheap. Worth it in my book. We visited on foot, Qunicy Market, New England Aquarium, took a cruise in Boston Harbor and enjoyed dinner in the North End Italian Village. Our group totaled 15 with my daughter 2 the youngest and my Aunt 90 the oldest. We walked everywere, felt very very safe and found the city to be exeptionally clean for being almost 400 years old. The theater district, back bay and the North End are vibrant with activity at 7 in the morning when I went for coffee or at 10 o'clock at night. This is a real treat for you to experience that urban atmosphere. A world of difference from suburbia!!! The hotel location was great I also noticed the Franklin Langham looked realy nice with an equally good location. Good luck, Enjoy and get some italian food in the North End!!!

"hotel_189","hotel_5820","Great location/Great place to stay Did much online research for a place to stay in Boston for two nights midweek. Would have loved to stay at XV Beacon or Nine Zero. Got a little scared, though, when I saw the prices at XV Beacon and how small people said the rooms were at Nine Zero. The Wyndham worked out just great though. I was able to narrow down a rate on Hotwire of $88.00 per night!! This was after finding the next lowest rate of $137 on Wyndham. I did join Wyndham by Request and asked to have the number applied to my Hotwire reservation. I received a lovely e-mail from the Wyhdham by Request manager telling me this would be no problem. And how much she looked forward to meeting us when we checked in. When we checked in, we didn't seem to have the personal touch that we expected of the front desk staff or food/drink in the room. There was a well stocked mini bar. And when we had a few items from there, the charges did not show up on the bill. So I guess I'm not sure how the program is supposed to work. I thought we'd have things specifically laid out for us. Or that we would have had a note or comment from the front desk. The bartender, Scott, is fabulous. Didn't have a chance to eat in the restaurant. The parking is expensive at $32.00 per night. But we just parked at check-in and walked the town. There is unlimited in and out of the garage, though, when you valet, if you do decide to use your car. Boston is a walking town, though. And the T service is great for getting around. All in all, a great place to stay. Would definitely stay again and recommend it. I want to amend my review posted on February 9. My rating of the Wyndham Boston has improved!! I sent an e-mail to Wyndham ByRequest in response to their survey about our stay. I mentioned that I was confused by what I felt to be inconsistency with the ByRequest program. It turns out that hotels booked on Hotwire do not qualify for ByRequest amentities. I did receive credit for the stay to my account. But the special price I got on Hotwire meant that the ByRequest benefits did not apply. Once again, I received a very nice e-mail from the ByRequest manager explaining this. I will definitely look to the Wyndham for my first choice of lodging on any future trips!!","Feb 9, 2004","6","6",5,5,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$322"

The hotel is very well maintained and clean. Our room was very big with a separate bedroom and living room.The Freedom Trail and Quincy Market are a couple of blocks from the hotel. We were able to pretty much walk or take the subway anywhere we wanted to go.I checked out the hotel that the other people in our group stayed at, and we had a much nicer place to stay and it was less expensive.I have read other reviews that complain about the location of this hotel. If you don't mind staying in a hotel that isn't right next to a mall, you will do fine here. Many shops, attractions, and restaurants are within walking distance.As other reviewers have pointed out, make sure to enroll in Wyndham ByRequest on their website. They esentially customize your room, and make sure that there is a beverage and snack of your choice in your room when you arrive. Each day they provided us with two bottles of water. I know that doesn't seem like a big deal, but most hotels are charging $5 for a bottle of water. You also are guaranteed the best available room when you arrive, late check-out if you need it, and free long distance and local calls.Parking is $32 a night at the hotel.

The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. I was assigned to a room with 2 double beds in the Reunion Tower. The lobby level is large and beautiful, but it was somewhat confusing to navigate. There is a very expensive coffee/snack shop and gift shop with very limited seating. The elevators were essentially efficient. I never waited longer than 2-3 minutes, even during busy times.My room was clean and comfortable. The bedding was luxurious! There was a small closet with an ironing board and iron. The TV was a decent size but I didn't much of a chance to watch it. The bathroom was also very nice. They provided plenty of towels and toiletries. My only complaint about the room was the lack of electrical outlets. I needed to plug in my laptop and cell phone chargers, and I found only 2 outlets and they were very difficult to reach.We did not eat in any of the hotel's restaraunts, but they looked nice. We did enjoy cocktails at the second floor bar, and we found the prices reasonable and the service adequate.Overall, I enjoyed this hotel and had a good experience.","Oct 26, 2008","1","1",5,5,5,5,6,5,4,"3.5","$242"

Had a couple meals at the Centennial Diner and they were very good. Prices are a little higher than probably warranted, but still a good meal.Be aware that this hotel is not the easiest to get to in Dallas. In fact, downtown dallas is somewhat hard to drive within. It took me 30 minutes to get back to the hotel at night.

The room was medium sized and because we were here for a huge conference, there were no discounts, so the room was $145 per night for a king. There was no microwave, refrigerator or any other common convenience, but the coffee could be purchased downstairs and the cost rivaled Starbucks but the flavor didn't. The lamps were equivalent to a mid 80s motel except with fluorescent bulbs. Valet parking is $20 per night, and the internet is a whopping $10 for 24 hours.

"hotel_194","hotel_7309","Great location Very nice, clean hotel. Restaurants way too expensive for the average family (about $13 for an average breakfast plate). Would recommend the Corner Bakery several blocks away for breakfast. Bar is also very expensive, $8.50 for a simple whiskey and 7-up. Extremely small pool for the size of the hotel, not many deck chairs. Requested frig 3 weeks in advance, none available on check-in, told it was first come, first served even if it was reserved. Finally got a frig. Very polite staff, although housekeeping knocked on the door at 830 AM. Great location, walking distance to at least 3 museums, the JFK 6th floor museum in the Dallas School Book Depository Building is a must-see.

"hotel_194","hotel_5616","Overrun by screaming 13 year olds Wow - DO NOT STAY HERE if you want to sleep. If you are interested in roaming bands of hundreds of unsupervised screaming children, apparently this is the place for you. There's really not much for kids at the hotel or in the area, so they were just chasing each other all over the hotel and joyriding in the elevators with the hotel staff doing nothing about it. Multiple times I waited over 20 minutes to get on an elevator along with a lot of annoyed adults. A group of kids would show up and literally push people out of the way to get on an elevator. I pointed out the  100 or so people waiting on an elevator to the front desk staff and they suggested I go up to the 2nd floor and try to get on there. Another 100 people were waiting for the elevators on the 2nd floor. I went back down and asked where the stairs are - to my room on the 12th floor.The atrium area echoes sound so badly that the sound of the bar, restaurant, and lobby (oh and don't forget all the screaming kids) is amplified and very loud inside the rooms, even with towels shoved under the door and the tv on. I'm not saying the hotel should be supervising other peoples kids, but if they book kids dance competitions and volleyball tournaments and allow children to stay in rooms together without an adult, then they created this situation and should take the responsibility to deal with the result. Clearly Hyatt was not prepared for the situation they created, or is not interested in maintaining their reputation with business customers - or adults in general, for that matter.Other than that, the rooms were ok, although becoming a bit worn (peeling paint, torn wallpaper, scuffed furniture, stains) and it doesn't look like they are properly maintaining this hotel. Most likely their business has fallen off due to Reunion arena and renovating reunion tower and this is the result.On the positive side, the valet staff was great and very friendly. The (Parrinos?) restaurant was surprisingly very good.I got this room for $60 on priceline - so beware on priceline - if you bid on a 4 star hotel downtown, you are most likely to get the hyatt. Check expedia - I stayed at the Adolphus and Stoneleigh previous weeks for ~130/night booking through expedia. The extra money is definitely worth being able to sleep and not having to take the stairs 12 flights to your room.Unless you are a screaming 13 year old and want to spend the night joyriding in hotel elevators, I suggest you not stay here.","Jul 2, 2008","4","1",2,3,5,4,2,2,3,"3.5","$242"

Other Hyatt's we have stayed in have a sauna or steam room but this one did not.

There is a sports bar in the atrium which is incredibly noisy, even at 1 AM, and the noise carries straight through the door.

I am not super sensitive-- I live directly next to the Bay Bridge in San Francisco-- but this is loud and disturbing, clanking of glasses, shouting, etc., and it's still going at 1 AM.

"hotel_194","hotel_1423","Wouldn't be my first chocie for a family vacation I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights in May. Check-in was a breeze and overall I didn鈥檛 have any problems with the room. The room was a good size and was clean. The Hyatt had a note in my room that said if you use your 鈥淧rivacy Please鈥?sign then the maids won鈥檛 change you room at all. I used this sign so I could leave my laptop setup when I was out of my room and to their credit the maids didn鈥檛 enter my room at all over the 4 days I was there (I left the sign out the whole time). I鈥檝e been to other hotels where they pretty much just ignore the sign and the maids enter at 8:00am anyway. I have different observations if you鈥檙e a business traveler versus a family traveling on vacation. I鈥檒l start with a quick tip for business travelers. I was traveling on business and high-speed internet is always key for me. I ended up on the 6th floor in a room pretty far away from the lobby area. When I connected to the hotels high-speed internet service via wi-fi (the only option possible in my room) the signal I got was very low. A number of times my connection would just drop when I was connected for even a short time. I asked at the front desk regarding what could be done and they gave me a device (they called it a booster) which plugged into my laptop and that did the trick. I didn鈥檛 have any problems with dropped connections after that and I didn鈥檛 have to pay anything for the booster, so good save on the Hyatt鈥檚 part since otherwise they would have had to move me to a room with better reception. As for my other business (and families) advice, the Hyatt isn鈥檛 near much in terms of restaurants that you can easily walk to so either rent a car if you tire easily of room service, expect to take some cab rides, or go across the street to the light-rail system if you want to venture away from the Hyatt (room service was actually pretty good and pretty fast 鈥?but not cheap). For families traveling who are looking for a resort experience just one word or warning, the pool and hot-tub at the Hyatt are fairly small and are on the roof on the 3rd floor. When I was there it was very, very hot on the roof with virtually no shade (no umbrellas or covered chairs). If your looking to spend some serious time by the pool I think that would make the Hyatt a bad choice -- I was out on the pool deck on a 90+ degree, sunny day and it was unbearable. Also, the Hyatt has a coffee shop on the lobby level, it鈥檚 a great place to get soft drinks, pizza or snacks for the kids. I almost walked past without noticing all the goodies they had for sale. Cab fare from DFW to the hotel was $45 and took about 30 minutes. My room faced the train tracks and I never was bothered by the noise, but you might want to ask for a room away from the tracks if your easily disturbed by outside noise.","May 23, 2008","0","0",4,5,2,5,6,5,4,"3.5","$242"

The bedding ended up off the bed in the middle of the night and was just too much to make it acceptable. The location is scary....we were warned not to walk around after dark in this section of town.

"hotel_194","hotel_4786","A Serviceable Convention Hotel in a Lackluster Downtown This is the 5th or 6th time Priceline has sent me to a Grand or Regency Hyatt in a major US city. Each time I was well pleased with the value for the money, but each time, the price was well under 50% of the lowest published rate. These Hyatts are 30-40 year-old convention hotels. They are 3-3.5 stars, not 4-star hotels. Nice rooms, nice amenities, but old and lacking the dreamy beds of nicer Starwood and Marriott hotels.The Dallas Hyatt sits at the edge of downtown, behind the railroad station. While some reviewers have complained of freight train noise, it should be no problem if you are used to even a little bit of big city traffic noise. It is set off from the rest of the downtown by some underpasses that are not particularly hospitable at night. Thus, while much of downtown is within walking distance, you may not wish to chance the walk after dark.The Hyatt has the obligatory huge atrium and multiple dining/drinking options. The next-door revolving restaurant tower, however, is under construction. The food/drinks were serviceable, if overpriced. The staff was most friendly and well-intentioned.Bottom line -- I wouldn't book this hotel at published rates. If I had a choice and a car, I would stay at a suburban hotel near dining/entertainment.

Because of past issues at Hyatt's we not only filled out the door-hanger-menu but we gave it to one of the staff who delivered it to room service the night before.We needed to leave the hotel at 7:15am sharp for the gymnastics meet.At 7:05, no breakfast. I called room service, they acknowledged my order, but said they were busier than usual and it would be at least 15 more minutes before breakfast would be delivered.We cancelled breakfast (and were not charged for it) and were able to run to a nearby store and get a bagel and some fruit juice.On the bus over to the gymnastics meet we talked to other parents who were very upset that they travelled 2000 miles, stayed in a fairly high-end hotel, and now their kids would be competing in a 4-hour gymnastics meet without having had breakfast.This is something that would be forgivable for a 2-star hotel but not for a 3-star or higher hotel.It's possible the room service experience might be better if the hotel were half full or less. I won't be returning to this Hyatt. If you plan to stay there I recommend:1) Find out how full they expect the hotel to be when you are staying there. 2) Don't depend on room service.

"hotel_194","hotel_5465","It's big and somewhat pricey - good location Stayed over new years 31st -2nd. This place will always have lots of football fans attending the Cotton Bowl over new years, so it gets slammed . They were the host hotel for one of the football teams - so mostly all fans from one school - just make sure that is your team. They do a decent job of managing the crowds, especially at the valet. The rooms were just okay - not as clean as I hoped - somewhat dirty pillow cases, but they do have 1100 rooms, so I cut them some slack. The location is great as they are connected to the DART public transit system, real close to the West end and only a $10 or so cab ride up to the uptown area (I suggest two restaurants in uptown - Cuba Libre and Zizikis). The main bar in the atrium is pretty nice, lots of TVs, places to lounge and shuffelboard. One disappointing note was that due to being completely sold out with so many late check outs, as of 3 PM new year's day, they did not get around to cleaning our room and said that the staff was going home at 5:30, so it couldn't be done. Valet parking at $18 (free entry/leave) seemed worth it over trying to figure out and haul to a further parking lot for $10 (which was not free entry/leave).

Usually, this makes a staff cranky and unpleasant, in my experience. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I like to stay in hotels that have upgraded to softer mattresses with sheets/down comforters instead of gross bedspreads, and the Hyatt fit the bill. My only complaint - and it could be a big one for some people - is that one side of the hotel overlooks three train tracks. Two of the tracks carry commuter traffic and the third seems to be a regular freight train track. During the night, trains ran OFTEN with increasing frequency as the morning arrived. Twice during the night freight trains came through and my floor literally vibrated from the noise (by the way, I was all the way on the 6th floor). It was a little creepy and I thought I might have imagined it, but it occured the second night we were there also.If you plan a visit to the Hyatt, ask to be put on the far side of the hotel away from the trains and you will probably be okay.","Jan 2, 2008","0","0",4,5,3,5,5,6,1,"3.5","$242"

If I were to stay there again for a weekend, I'd look more uptown.Parking: Based on other Tripadvisor recommendations, we used the self-park a half block from the hotel (from the main entrance, just take a left). $10/day with no in/out versus $18/ day for the hotel valet. There always seemed to be a long line for the valet, so it seemed easier to self-park.Check-in: Arrived late night/early morning, so no long lines. Check-in was quick. I asked for a room with a city view and there was no problem getting one.Room: King bed, non smoking with city view. Standard room. Nothing special . We were on the 8th floor with a decent city view. There's trains that run on that side of the hotel, but the noise did not bother us at all (just rolling of trains, not blowing of horns, etc).

"hotel_194","hotel_9698","Great building, inconsistent service This is the hotel that was featured on the opening credits of the TV show Dallas for many years, and remains the epitome of the mirrored glass architecture from the late 70s/early 80s in Dallas. That, and the trademark atrium, date this hotel somewhat. Still, they have done a nice job of updating things. Rooms are airy and sizable--and placing the beds overlooking the view (as opposed to parallel to the windows) make the room feel bigger still. Good beds, and enjoyable showers, with noteworthy water pressure. My room, 2321, had a good view of the skyline, and many of the rooms on that side of the hotel do--request one. The hotel is well located for highway access, particularly for a downtown hotel. Valet parking is $19.50 a day, and can be slow for car retrieval. Internet is $10 per day--obscene given margins on this service, and outrageous given that many less expensive hotels no longer charge for this. Fitness center is well maintained, and though some equipment could use updating, it is nicely furnished and free to guests. There is a pool and hottub on 3, but can't say it looked very welcoming. . .overlooks the back side--a rather desolate view--of the hotel.What is frustrating about the hotel is the service--while always pleasant, it can be lacking. Housekeeping just made my bed and replaced my towels one day--no tidying up. Another day, they neglected to come, altogether. In fairness, the hotel recouped well, and I got follow ups from the housekeeping manager and the assistant rooms manager--both of whom attempted to make amends. While recovery was good, there were sufficient lapses to disappoint. Yes, got this room for $59 a night on Priceline, but still expect good service from a 4 diamond Hyatt Regency. . .with work, perhaps I would be impressed next time. Building, overall, is a pleasant surprise--and if service had been at the same level, this would be a great find, particularly at the Priceline rate. Would still return, but would caution those paying full price that you may or may not get 4 diamond caliber service during your stay. And note to hotel--seek ways to eliminate internet fees. . .it feels as if you are nickel and diming your guests. Bad.","Dec 2, 2007","2","2",3,5,5,4,5,3,4,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_7178","A generic conference hotel The Hyatt Regency in Dallas is a predictable and unexciting place to stay for a few days. The only big news is that the Reunion Tower just closed for 12-18 months of renovations, and this includes the Antares restaurant and the bar on the floor above. The other hotel restaurants are unexciting and will close for private events on random days without any warning that I could find.The rooms were clean and the biggest housekeeping problem was that I was allotted only one bar of soap that I had to move back and forth from the sink to the shower. I didn't ask for a second bar of soap, and housekeeping apparently didn't think it was necessary during the 3 nights I was there. The hotel sits close to railroad tracks, and you'll hear the trains no matter what floor you're on. I was able to mask the sound for a little while with the A/C unit, but the fan would always return to AUTO after a few hours and then I'd hear the trains again. I could have stayed on the other side of the building away from the trains, but the vibrations are still there and the view is worse.The conference rooms were typically air conditioned too much and the food was average. It could be that this is what was paid for and attendees of other conferences may rave about the food. The high point of this hotel (literally) is the tower which is now closed.I'd look for another hotel if I were returning to Dallas. This one was clean and safe, but as a Hyatt, I expected much more than I got.","Nov 19, 2007","1","1",4,4,5,4,5,4,1,"3.5","$242"

I was given a room on the 15th floor and my wireless didnt work not even with the booster they supplied (some rooms dont even have a wired connection). So after going to the very helpful lady on the front desk she moved me to a room on the 5th floor where my wireless worked great.Could see the Texas depository from my room too which was quite cool.There's a small heated outdoor pool as well as a hottub which is pretty useful. There's a choice of restaurants but I didnt go into the tall reunion tower as I didnt have any decent clothes with me so i ordered (excellent !!!!) room service - even the bread had been warmed!There's a $15 buffet breakfast where you can eat as much as you want and the selection is excellent.

"hotel_194","hotel_6448","Great place - esp if you get a deal I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency Dallas several times - most recently in Nov 2007. The hotel is great for quality, location, and convenience. The lobby and the rooms are very nice - on the high end for a Hyatt. The rooms have comfortable beds with all the extras. Best part about this place is that there are always Hotwire and Priceline deals available - this is 4 star on Priceline and most recently I got a room with a $70 bid. The hotel has express check in kiosks - even if you book on Priceline or Hotwire the kiosk will let you pick the kind of room you want (which floor, park view vs. city view, etc). The hotel is a great location on the east side of downtown Dallas - convenient to all the major freeways (I-30, I-35E, I-45). You are minutes away from the West End Marketplace, the JFK memorial, the State Fair, Deep Ellum, and the clubs/restaurants in the Oak Lawn/Cedar Springs area. Dallas' rail line runs very close to the hotel as well. Some tips: The hotel is at the I-35E exit for Corporate Drive *East* (not West). When leaving the hotel, you need to take a right at the second light to get onto the freeway (the first light will take you into downtown). For parking, use the public lot at the bottom of the hill. Its a max of $10/day - its cheaper than paying the Valet parking plus you can come/go as you want *quickly* any time day/night. You'll just have to walk your suitcase a short ways up the hill. This is one of those huge anonymous hotels so inevitably some people who expect a lot of personal service are going to be unhappy with it. Only negatives I saw: you hear some industrial noise in there at night (I don't know if its the elevator or what?). Might wanna bring earplugs. Also - Hyatt tends to nickel and dime you to death (charge extra for little things like $4 bottled water and $2.50 spray starch).","Nov 6, 2007","4","4",5,5,6,5,6,4,1,"3.5","$242"

"hotel_194","hotel_8184","Good stay, but loud. I stayed at the Hyatt because of a conference I was attending. I was given a room that overlooked the Atrium (1145)--literally, over the whole Atrium area. Check in was easy and room staff and service were absolutely wonderful. I had a problem with my bed light not working and they sent up a mechanic who fixed the problem in no time (it really was electrical--I had identified the faulty cord, but he made the thing work consistently!). I ordered room service three times and it was impeccable every time--expensive and extremely filling, but very good ($23 for the standard breeakfast). You even get the unexpected steamed asparagus and grilled tomato for breakfast...veggies for breakfast--a nice treat! Thermostat in the room was crazy, it took some fine tuning to adjust it correctly. The beds were awesome--so comfortable. My view stunk--roofs, trains (and the whistles!) and the tower elevator was my view, but hey, I'm working, so what. My tub was clogged--I left a message with the front desk when I left--didn't have time to call before then and it didn't seem to bother me (my own filth, I guess? Eww!). I had dinner in the revolving tower one night--it was great and an absolutely wonderful view--nice sunset, full moon, great view of the book depository...I'm being bad, but it really was our initial view...apparently you revolve once an hour and that's how we figured that out. Having a drink up there proved to be a weird experience, so we opted for the hotel bar. Great bar but the World Series was on (poor Rockies!), so it was packed--no service at all. But I was here the day before the Series (and ironically, the day before our conference) and there was hardly anybody at the bar and I received superb service. I got to know Bob really well! I also had breakfast in the breakfast buffet area (forgot the name)-it was $15 (included juice and coffee) and a nice selection. I like that the hotel serves Starbucks--I know, I'm a coffee snob. Stay away from scrambled eggs though. They will cook whatever eggs you want, so do that option! I had the scrambled eggs at a conference brunch and they were gross--it tasted like powdered eggs...I backpack, so I know what they taste like! Other things, let's see--I forgot my workout clothes and they have a pretty nice gym and an outside terrace on the 3rd floor. They actually sold me a workout outfit (shorts and a t-shirt) for $15! It wasn't that bad and hey, I felt better about all the drinks at the bar! The one bad thing: The atrium rooms are LOUD!! Granted, I am a light sleeper and I always bring earplugs. On most nights, I just cranked the AC fan and the little wall that separates the foyer from the room seemed to work well for noise control (bar noise like loud laughing, glasses clinking, etc.). However, on my last night, there was a YoungLife conference or something and those kids were going nuts clapping and chanting until 1:00am. It's a good thing I have insomnia when I go on work travel, otherwise I think I might have killed them. I ordered a glass of wine to my room at 11:30 to wind down and the room service guy was saying that alot of people were complaining about the noise. So, just be forewarned: Atrium room=great interior view, lots 'o noise. My friends in the interior rooms said they heard nothing, so that might be something to consider if you don't bring earplugs! Last things--you can check in and print your boarding passes at the front desk and cabs were always lined up whenever we needed them. Really, the staff was absolutely wonderful in every aspect. Oh, one more thing--there is a BBQ joint called Sonny Bryan's Smokehouse BBQ that is relatively close to the hotel...it was recommended, but eh, not so much. I'm from the south originally, so you really have to have some good BBQ to impress me. I was happy to have some good fried okra and all, but the place struck me as somewhat of a tourist lure. Heck, if you never eat BBQ, you just might like it! But I digress...","Nov 1, 2007","4","4",4,5,5,4,6,6,3,"3.5","$242"

Fortunately I had read TripAdvisor, so knew to avoid the railroad-view rooms. The hotel also honored my request to be away from the ice machine, elevator, atrium, etc. My room was very remote but completely quiet! (An aside: Whoever came up with the atrium design should be made to sleep near one. The noise is terrible.) The room was attractive, though the furniture was a tad tired and there was a stain on the carpet. The bathroom was nicely appointed, and the bed was wonderful. The only meal I had at the hotel was a room-service breakfast. The eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc. were delicious, but oddly garnished with asparagus. Whatever! It was delivered hot and on time.

"hotel_194","hotel_3359","Don't Plan on Sleeping Not recommended if you like to sleep. The hotel sits DIRECTLY on a major train station that serves 4 different trains - DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) commuter trains, Trinity and Amtrak long distance trains during the day and then at night - ALL night - mile long freight trains rumble past the hotel. Not only does each blow its horn repeatedly, but long before and after the freight trains pass the hotel the echo of it riding the rails can be heard. Having read the reviews I thought I was safe being on a high floor, but no such luck.

We were on the tenth floor. Every 45 minutes a loud train horn would blow followed by 5 minutes of the bed vibrating. Right when you'd fall back to sleep, the horn would blow again. When we called down to complain the desk said both sides of the hotel have noise, one from the train and the other from the freeway. Wish someone would have told us that when we checked in. Instead they said they'd comp us our coffee in the morning. THANKS...that makes up for not sleeping an entire night. Another nit picky thing is the tv can't be seen from the bed.

"hotel_194","hotel_5342","A good hotel -- especially if you get it on Priceline We stayed at the Hyatt Regency on Sept. 21, after getting it for $64 on Priceline. The location was great for us -- at the interchange of I-30 and I-35E -- because we just needed a place to stay while we were en route to Austin.Parking was kind of a mess. We pulled in front of the hotel to check in, only to encounter a minor traffic jam that blocked us in for about 15 minutes. The front desk said the hotel was valet only, but there's a parking lot less than a half-block away that's half the price and very convenient.We checked in around 11:30 p.m., and the hotel was busy, loud and full of teenagers. Check-in was easy and we got a room on the 19th floor. Maybe it was because we used priceline, but the entire floor had a sort-of septic tank smell to it. The rooms didn't stink, but the hallway sure did. The room itself is fine -- big, cushy bed. I loved the double french doors on the bathroom. We had a single king room, and were somewhat perplexed by the placement of the TV. ... you can't see it well from the bed (it faces the desk and two chairs.)We left early the next morning to continue on the Austin. Check-out was easy, as was retrieving the car from the lot down the straight.The overall: I was pleased with it, flaws on all, because we paid 64 bucks a night for it.

"hotel_194","hotel_2994","Rooms and Location Great, but some problems Like many have stated in review of this hotel, the location is fantastic. It was within walking distance or a short cab ride to the Convention Center, Kennedy Plaza, Market St., Etc. The lobby is really nice inside with a waterfall and a nice relaxing feel to it. I worried, because if you read my review last year of the Sheraton in Arlington, TX, the lobby was great, and everything else was horrible. But I proceeded with hope. Front desk check-in was a breeze, unlike my last review at the South Point in Vegas, as staff was very friendly. In the lobby they have kiosks were you can print airline tickets, which was helpful. They also have a nice market store for late night snacks, and a nice gift shop. The rooms were very nice, which shocked me since other reviewers were down on the rooms. The decor was very nice, and you know me, I love the beds. And this bed was REALLY comfortable! Best part about this place. You could really sleep on these baby's! The TV was in an odd place where you had to pull it out of the cabinet, and twist it towards the bed. If you're on the bed, you're looking down at the TV, odd, but no big deal. The bathroom was nice, and the sink area was modern and new. The shower area is starting to look a little worn out, but it wasn't too bad. The worst part of this hotel was the dinning. I was there for a bodybuilding  fitness expo, and the hotel was packed with people. They were hosting this expo, which was at the Convention Center, and they knew of the large crowds months in advance. However, there were HUGE waiting times for the main restaurant on the 2nd floor. One night, I was alone, and waiting 45 mins to be seated, then the waiter, who looked like he was the only one working, said my food, which I only ordered an appetizer, would take an additional 45 mins! I figured they were just understaffed for that night. However, the next day for lunch, my table waited 2 hours for our food, which wasn't even that good!! That really made this hotel drop down a few notches. The pool was not good either as others have stated, very small. It's an expensive place, so not everyone could stay there, but overall it's not that bad a hotel. I'd stay there again, and just eat elsewhere. Rooms were nice and quiet, and the location was perfect.","Aug 24, 2007","9","7",5,6,6,5,6,3,6,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_1124","Terrific Stay at Dallas Hyatt Regency @ Reunion Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Dallas-Reunion Arena for Crimes Against Children Conference (Aug.12-Aug.16, 2007). Check-in on Sunday was a snap. 2,500 conference attendees present from law enforcement, d.a. offices, mental health, and social work fields. I was initially booked a room facing west, and found that a/c was not working. Requested engineering to fix a/c and was told that I would be moved to another room. Room arrangements were made within 15 minutes. Was assigned to 26th floor with a panoramic view of the Dallas Skyline! Wow! No a/c problem here. However, hallways were warm.Room itself was large enough for myself, wife and 3 year old daughter. Plenty of space - desk, sofa chair w/ ottaman, pillow-top king bed, 27 T.V., microfridge, beautifully appointed bathroom w/ typical Hyatt touches. Carpeting and window drapes a little outdated. All staff (valet parking attendants, bellman, concierge, check-in/registration) were professional and very courteous. My daughter lost a blanket for her plush toy, and cleaning staff found it and returned to my daughter! What a wonderful touch!Room service exceeded my expectations. Portions were large, and always received a follow-up/courtesy call from room service if everything was satisfactory. Hotel is connected to downtown via underground walkway that leads to Union Station and Light Rail platform. Very easy to use and take to shopping/eating areas of Downtown (West End).Valet parking is a little steep @ $18 + tax, but very convenient with minimal wait for your vehicle to be brought out, with in/out privileges. There are city-owned parking lots to the north and south of hotel and charge $10, but NO in/out priveleges. Pool very small relative to number of rooms, but was hardly used by guests during my stay. Pool never had more that 4-5 kids in it at anytime.Never found any beggars, or panhandlers around the hotel, but would avoid Union Station unless your walking thru it. Hotel is within 5 minute walk to West End District, Dealy Plaza, Sixth Floor Musuem, as well as Union Station DART light rail stop.Hotel atrium is very pleasing to view and spend the afternoon just people watching. Prices for breakfast / lunch buffet run $15/pp. Explore other eating venues via 2 min. light rail ride to West End district.Check-out was a breeze. Slight wait for valet parking because of enormous amount of guests checking out of hotel on Aug. 16, but handled well. Rate was $113 + tax /nt., but I'm sure that priceline / hotwire deals are out there. Lots of praises for this hotel in spite of prior reviews. I really felt and was treated like some VIP. TIPS:-Hotel connected to light rail station via tunnel. Costs $2.50 for all day pass, incl. bus routes-If possible, consider parking vehicle in $10 lot, and use light rail to get around downtown and nearby attractions.-Use a map to get familiar with streets around hotel as downtown one-way streets can be confusing.-Drive defensively in downtown expressways.-Very helpful concierge, utilize to eliminate uncertainties about attractions, shopping/dining options.","Aug 21, 2007","1","1",5,5,5,6,6,6,6,"3.5","$242"

Doctors, laywers, other professions don't put up with this. Several lines to check in - 1-2 hours long. Bags were not sent up after three hours. Reason: bags were mixed up and sent to wrong rooms, had to wait in more lines to find bellhop to go to lost and found to retrieve missing luggage. More lines (15-20 minutes) at elevators from morning to evening. There is a bright side to this: Restaurants, too-soft beds and valet parking. They run, smile, and nearly make up for the rest. Restaurants/lounges are on the second floor. Service is okay, mixed drinks ($7) are very strong. Group of 4 large men were asked to leave Italian restaurant ($10-$30/meal) after launching into vulgar, profane, and sexually explicit conversation. A teacher, not the manager, persuaded the inebriated to leave. The lobby is beautiful (waterfall, marble, glass, plants, spotless), the revolving bar in the Reunion Tower was a nice experience. Service in the tower is better than the hotel's. If you book a stay here, call and ask if a convention (they happen often) will coincide. You may reconsider.

It was simply a small cement pond' dug into an unfinished roof area, where the sun beating on the surface would make the heat unbearable. There was only room in the pool for approx. 10 people to stand in it just to cool off. Swimming was out of the question. The kicker of my entire stay was the abundance of bedbugs! I was eaten alive!

It's a revolving restaurant atop the Reunion Tower, and I've experienced something like it in NYC and Vegas. Seems like a waste In Dallas, when all you can see is flatland on one side and downtown on the other. For the prices, I'm expecting a great meal. So wrong.As soon as you step off the elevator, you're hit with a smell that's a cross between the toilet and mildew. I had a waiter with a thick accent and I had to have the poor man repeat everything twice...and because he didn't understand me, he had to have me repeat everything I said twice! Five minutes after I ordered, the food came. It was so fast that it made me think it was already prepared and they heated the plate up in the microwave. It certainly tasted like it was. The presentation was mediocre and I was only able to eat half of my much anticipated steak. For what I paid for this meal, it should have been so much better.The next night I was at their Dome lounge for cocktails, which was one floor up from the resturaunt. Same smell.Good service on both nights, though. I suppose the lack of patronage should have told me something. The hotel itself wasn't bad. The king sized room was huge with very little furniture. My towels had holes in them. But still, very clean and the staff very friendly. The poor woman manning the Coffee Post, though. This is a conference hotel, so there is always a conference going on. Yet they have ONE person at the coffee shop, and once in awhile when the hotel manager sees that the line has gone on to, oh 30 or so people, she'll come over to lend a hand.There are so many better hotels than this, especially for the price you pay.","Jul 17, 2007","2","1",3,5,3,5,6,6,5,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_4790","Some Good, Some Bad We attended a huge conference at the Hyatt. First of all, everything is so crazy expensive, I know that is expected at most hotels, but I had an eighteen dollar hamburger (it wasn't that good, believe me...). The location of the hotel seemed fine, but we had a car. If you had to walk to various locations, it seemed a little remote. They didn't have our room that we requested when we got there (they only had a king and offered to put a rollaway in the room--- NOT!), but I called the manager and miraculously a double room appeared. Whatever. I think the hotel did a good job of handling the huge crowd and the staff seemed genuinely concerned that everything was up to par during our stay. I will say though, it is a pretty noisy hotel. Between the atrium/restaurants in the lobby (the sound carries) and the trains going all night, it was a little annoying. The beds are so comfortable though and the maid service was great (we left them a tip). We didn't really eat at any of the restaurants, just had room service. We did eat out though at a place called Bone Daddys. It was a barbeque place. if you don't mind waitresses that are dressed like hookers, this is a good place to eat. Lastly, go to the Galleria and Northpark malls, good shopping! :)","Jul 2, 2007","2","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_3250","A Pig with Lipstick I don't usually write reviews on hotels unless they are outstanding, yet I had to write something about the Hyatt Regency in Dallas. With the multitude of other hotels in Dallas, I would avoid this one. There are many, many problems with the quality of the property. It reminds me of the proverb, a pig with lipstick on is still a pig. It has ben dressed up on the outside (and lobby), yet the remainder is still very much as it was when it was first built. My room, on the club floor, had very low, eight-foot ceilings covered with popcorn. The bed was fine, yet the room felt dated. One one side of the property you have the trains at all hours, and on the other side, a wonderful view of the freeway. The halls are dark and cave-like, the swimming pool looked like something found in a motel 6, the workout room was miniature, there were no facilities for changing into workout clothing, the elevators were constantly clogged (at one point, it took over 20 minutes before one arrived), and the tower that is attached to the property looks like a prison. The underground tunnel attaching the hotel to the tour (and train stations) is stuck in the 70's and has many panhandlers asking for money for a burger. The last issue that I will raise is the extremely poor quality of the internet service. As I was here on business, I needed to have reliable internet access. I had to go down to the second floor lobby as it would not work reliably in the club room or my room.After staying at Hyatts all over the country, I am quite disappointed with this one. Avoid it.","Jun 28, 2007","4","3",3,3,3,4,3,5,2,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_7035","Avoid the side with the trains.. We just stayed at this property June 21 for one night. Our room was in the atrium section. The only complaint is our room faced the railroad tracks, which seemed to run all night long. Needless to say, we got very little sleep. This property is huge, a little difficult to find, and parking is not convenient fof hotel guests. We valet'ed for $18.00 for one night.","Jun 25, 2007","1","1",4,5,4,6,4,5,5,"3.5","$242"

They only offer valet for parking and we sat in line for valet for 30 minutes and then it was 18 dollars a day. When we asked them to bringour car up so we could get something out, they had lost our keys and couldn't find the car. It took over an hour. They did not give us the requested type of room. Their staff was less than cordial. We checked our bags at the bellhop the next day to have brunch. When we came back, they sent us to some closet where the gentleman took us into because we could find our bags faster than he could.

Nothing a taxi ride won't solve, but it's not as centrally located as other hotels with equally nice rooms and amenities.

The rooms are nothiing special. Nor is the location. It is close only to the 6th Floor Museum, otherwise you must have a car to do anything worthwhile. The Swimming pool is pitiful. It is about a s big as the bath tub in the rooms. Shame on Hyatt for a large business hotel to have such poor facilites. Overall mediocre.

"hotel_194","hotel_2487","Good value not that convenient location Hey, took a chance and low bid a star over the Memorial Day weekend for downtown Dallas. Wanted to be car-free for the long weekend, but close to some sights. Got a great rate on Priceline ($65.00 + tax), so cannot complaint about the price. The room is up to Hyatt standards, with nice bedding, towels and supplies. It is however at big convention hotel (over 1,000 rooms) so don't expect personalized service, unless you seek it out at the front desk or service desk. The problem, not the hotels fault, is that the whole downtown area ... resturants, nightclubs, and what little attractions that are in downtown Dallas closed up shop for most of the holiday weekend, I guess to go fishing. Your basically stuck the hotel for dining options, unless you wish to venture under a dingy tunnel to the train station or walk along a freeway ramp and under the RR to exit the hotel entrance to get to the other side of the tracks. The hotel is a good value if you get a good rate from one of the bid for travel sites, otherwise due to the location, next time I'm looking for a hotel in the Uptown or Cedar Springs area, much more walkable with people around (not just panhandlers - although they are people too)Good LuckChard, San Diego","May 30, 2007","3","3",6,5,3,5,5,5,1,"3.5","$242"

"hotel_194","hotel_1146","Great Dallas Hotel! My husband and I stayed two nights at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Dallas. This is a great hotel. I have stayed there on business a few times, but this was the first for a personal stay. Check in is fast and friendly. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, and so comfortable! There were two nightstands, bedlamps, a large television, hair dryer, ironing board and iron, coffee/tea maker, desk, and chair. The beds are magnificent. It is hard to get out of the bed it is so comfy. You can buy their signature bedding from Hyatt and we are strongly considering it they are that fabulous.We ordered room service the when we got there (Fri night) to be delivered the following morning (simply by filling out a door tag and placing it outside). Breakfast was promptly delivered on time and was delicious. It was approx. $16, but my husband and I split it and were very full. The staff called to confirm that our requests had been met (room service, extra towels). The exercise room houses some of the best equipment - especially the treadmills. I have run on many and these are by far the best. The hotel is connected to the Reunion Tower, which has awesome views of Dallas. There are three restaurants and a bar in the hotel so you could conceivably never leave. The West End is within walking distance as is Reunion Arena and the American Airlines Center (Mavericks and Stars). The only hiccup is parking. You may valet park or use an adjoining lot to self park for a fee ($10 per day). This was not a problem until Saturday night when we returned from being out all day to find a HS Prom taking place at the hotel. The entrance was blocked so we couldn't valet park and the adjoining lot was full. We finally just drove to a restaurant to eat and wait out the mess. We would have rather eaten at the hotel since we were tired and ready to stay put. Overall this was a very pleasant experience and we highly recommend this hotel.","May 4, 2007","2","2",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_4349","Excellent location and overall a pleasant stay. I visited the Hyatt as part of a holiday to Texas with my family. My two boys aged 10 and 13 loved it, especially the Reunion Tower (free to guests and wonderful views - recommend it night and day) and also the glass lifts in the atrium. Simple things etc.. The hotel is functional and the rooms were clean if not rich in features. Food, especially breakfast, was good and with the GBP:USD exchange rate as it is, very cheap. The location is terrific. Excellent views over downtown Dallas and we were especially fortunate as our room overlooked Dealey Plaza. It was pleasant to be able to walk to the Historic district. The only disappointment was the size of the swimming pool, which is tiny. Everything is bigger in Texas, except the hotel pool at the Hyatt Regency!","Apr 30, 2007","3","3",6,5,6,5,6,5,1,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_5853","It was ""conventional"" not ""personal"" I stayed here as part of a small group during the USA Volleyball Lone Star Qualifier. Our group was here for four days and three nights. The hotel is beautiful architecturally and the lobby floor plan flows smoothly with plenty of room for large groups. There are good restaurants and a nice coffee shop inside the hotel. There is also a very relaxing bar area with flat screen televisions and a couple of billiards tables. There is not much outside the hotel. There is an area called the West End where there are restaurants, bars and some retail stores. It is about a ten minute walk from the hotel. On the way to the West End shopping district you pass the scene where John F. Kennedy was assassinated. It was disappointing because there were hawkers there and it made the whole thing seem commercialized. I would not make the walk alone to the West End shopping district as there are many panhandlers and you have to walk underneath some Amtrak railroad tracks.The hotel rooms were average in size with nice comfortable beds with clean bedding/duvets, etc. The bathroom was on the small side but was updated with nice fixtures. The only negative about the bathroom was there was absolutely no water pressure, ever. I tried taking a shower at a different time every day, but there was never any water pressure. My only warning to fellow trip advisors would have to be that this hotel is what it is: it is a VERY large hotel that caters to convention crowds. They have everything streamlined: it does not take long to check in, it does not take long to get a cup of coffee, and it does not take long to have guest services assist you with requests (I lost the television remote control). However, this hotel does lack a personal presence that is hard to quantify. In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel to group travelers and to business travelers. If you are traveling with your family or with a spouse, it just doesn't have anything special that sets it apart from all the other convention hotels and I would stay at a another property with a little more personal attention.","Apr 25, 2007","4","3",4,4,5,5,5,5,1,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_9771","A very nice experience I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Dallas for one night on business. I got a decent rate through Priceline. The hotel was easily located with a GPS system, I would have been a little turned around if I didn't have it. I started with my Mapquest directions and gave up. There are just a lot of one-way streets.They originally checked me into a room on the 14th floor facing the highway. This is a very busy highway. It was just as crowded at 6AM as it was at 10PM. I thought it was a little noisy. Apparently the other side of the building faces a train track. The front desk said that side was even louder. If you can sleep through anything you will be fine. I'm a light sleeper and knew it would keep me up. I opted out of my king bed on the 14th floor for 2 double beds on the 23rd floor facing the highway. This room was much quieter.The rooms are normal size for a Hyatt. The bathrooms are nice and feature the standard Portico amenities that I'm fond of. TIP: If you are like me you will think your coffee pot is missing a part. Open the coffee ground packet and the missing piece is in there! It was early and I was half asleep...what can I say?I had dinner in the glowing dome that goes around...when in Rome... The food was typical hotel fancy food and the prix fix menu was reasonably priced. It was a little romantic for a single traveler dining alone, but it wasn't uncomfortable. The servers were very attentive and nice. At one point while the dome is making it's rotation you can see the grassy knoll. Again...when in Rome... :)The only thing about the hotel was that I felt like I was really isolated. It is mainly surrounded by office type buildings. There didn't look to be anywhere that I could walk to dinner, etc. I don't normally like to drive to get my meals. I felt a bit trapped in the hotel and wasn't excited about all the options. There did seem to be more action on the bar area on level 2, but I'm not certain they serve food. I asked my waiter and he wasn't sure.If you need to stay near that area the hotel is certainly comfortable, but it isn't a destination spot.","Apr 12, 2007","3","3",4,4,3,4,5,5,6,"3.5","$242"

Now the bad: No free internet, super expensive room service, LAME Parking situation. You can't even unload your bags and check in without battling the Valet guys. I recommend leaving your car at home, or just parking once and using public trans. Luckily everything is very close by.

For $18 a day i would think the hotel could afford to put some of that money towards paying the valet's a decent wage. Upon our check out the valet informed us that it does suck and that they get paid minimum wage.We had other problems but the Manager on Duty (Andrew) was helpful and let us get free Internet ($9.95 a day!!!).

"hotel_194","hotel_8057","Style and luxury in the heart of Dallas The Hyatt Regency Dallas could be described as a finely executed downtown mega-hotel. With over a thousand rooms, the hotel is simply massive. The front lobby always has a high level of traffic and I expect that the hotel is quite capable of handling huge conventions. There seemed to be quite a few on during my visit last year. Because the hotel is so large, you may not receive the personalized service you would expect from a smaller luxury hotel; however, I could find nothing to complain about during my visit. The valet parking was efficient, check in was swift (they also use an automated check out system which was very fast) and the room was everything you would expect from the Hyatt. All the furnishings were modern and luxurious. You will most certainly be impressed with the high level of detail and quiet sleep you receive in their sumptuous beds. I also recommend a visit to the upper floor observation deck and lounge. Our group enjoyed a nice bottle of Champagne while taking in the best possible view in Dallas. This would also be a choice location for a special date or celebration.I would highly recommend the Dallas Hyatt Regency for a romantic stay for two, a convention or a business stay.

My Brother spent over $10,000 at this hotel, to celebrate his 25th Wedding anniversary. Our Family flew in from all over the U.S. to share this event. The hotel stole from us in several ways:1) Charged us $150.00 per regular room, when the current rate was posted at $99.00 per room. They refused to adjust the rates.2) Charged us for 17 rooms (we contracted for 15) and we ONLY USED 15 rooms! They refused to correct this (we had proof of the rooms used)3) After spending over $6,000.00 on a banquet, the servers took away the food before all of the guests had a chance to eat. They removed over 40% of the food, that we paid for. When I confronted the manager (who was not present at the Banquet)she was misinformed by her staff, about the time that the food was removed, and then said We can't leave food out, for health reasons I never heard of anyone getting ill form eating food that has sitting in a buffet for one hour!!4) We prepaid $1,200 for all of the server's gratuities, including $250.00 to the bartender, but the bartender would ignore you if you didn't flash money in his face.5) Upon check out, I noticed that they added $10.00 to my bill. I asked them what it was for, and they said it was to pay for 2 bottles of water that were in my room. I told them I never drank the water, and they can look to make sure the water is still there. I was told sometimes housekeeping makes mistakes. I spoke to other guests, and they too were charged for water that they never drank.Over all, I would have to say that the GREED of this hotel management caused the employees to cross the line several times, which resulted in very significant theft. The reason they get away with it, is because no one confronts it and tries to correct it. We will never stay at another Hyatt again!Sad to report.........

He got a room for a pretty good deal, $100 on priceline, but was concerned afterward when he read some unfavorable reviews. I had promised I would definitely give our review once we completed our stay because it what the absolute best experience. Our room was huge! It was beautifully updated and furnished with a gigantic picture window facing Union Station and Dealey Plaza. The service was tremendous. The front desk clerk my husband spoke with when we checked in even had a silver platter, birthday card signed by all the front desk staff, and a bottle of sparkling wine (though we don't drink, it was a nice gesture) waiting for us when we returned from our delicious dinner at Trulucks. I'm a real fan of Westin's Heavenly bed, but the one in our room gave the HB a run for the money. It was a super comfortable king and in it we slept like babies! Great stay here.

The room was slightly larger than average and very comfortable, with the right amenties for the business traveler. A couple of in-house restaurants came in handy if you didn't feel like traveling out. However, if you want to avoid the higher prices, a 10-minute walk to the WestEnd district provided many and varied culinary choices, including fast food and well-known national restaurant chains, at affordable prices. For late night excursions, there were a couple of snack shops open til 11:00 p.m., again with reasonable prices.

"hotel_194","hotel_3951","Peril at the Hyatt..... I stayed at the Hyatt Regency with my boyfriend. It was our anniversary! Over the phone, I asked if I could receive a military rate... I was assured that the rate is $95.00 a night. After conversating with the concierge about the military he noted on my account of a complimentary upgrade. I booked 2 nights there. After I booked with the hotel, I looked at travelocity.com and other travel sites and found a rate for $89.00. That is 12 dollars plus 15% tax less..... not quite a military discount. When I arrived, Valet was wonderful (despite the $18.00 per day fee, in/out priviledges which was nice). Check in was a breeze, I arrived at 11, check in is not until 3, but they happily gave me a room. NO upgrade though... I did not make a big deal out of it. I ordered room service from the Centennial Cafe... arrived 45 min later... waiter was wonderful, food was disgusting. Room was amazing in my view.... a little warm... with 74 being the lowest it can go. TV placed in a horrible position.... below the level of the bed... makes no sense. Despite black grout inbetween the tiles in the shower... bathroom was wonderful, and gorgeous with the french doors and clouded windows. There was an ANIME convention.... if you do not know what Anime is... google it..... hundreds of people dressed up in costumes, smelled horrible, and were very outspoken in the elevators and everywhere in the hotel. The convention RUINED the elegance of the hotel.... it was like staying at a cheap motel!!!!! Elevators took approximately 20 minutes to get to you once you pressed the button. The second day, my card did not work into the room. I refused to take the elevators and wait forever. So I called security from my cell phone.. it wouldve been faster to take the eleavtors.... 30 minutes passed NO ONE came.. I called again and finally someone showed up! CHECKOUT..... charges for the cafe that I had no idea about... they did remove it after some argument. Total for 2 days, with valet parking, a movie, and taxes $312.00..... After constructively complaining to the manager... I was given an apology and that was it. Staff was horrible, Valet took FOREVER at times.... Not a great place to stay. The Reunion Tower is a must visit though!~","Sep 6, 2006","2","1",3,5,4,5,6,2,5,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_9143","Good for a convention, but... We thought we were going to have a relaxing and romantic weekend at the Hyatt Regency Dallas. However, when we arrived, we learned that there was an anime convention happening at the hotel. It was EXTREMELY loud and busy. Plus, the valet parking was overwhelmed with the traffic, and the hotel doesn鈥檛 allow self-parking. We finally dropped off the car, dodged the Yu-gi-oh and Sailor Moon look-alikes, and headed for our room. We found it to be modern and relatively clean. The bed was comfortable, but there wasn鈥檛 a fitted sheet, so we wrapped ourselves up like mummies while we slept. The rooms are not particularly quiet, but the outstanding service, in-room dining, and pay-per-view movies allowed us to have a romantic evening in. There is a decent work-out room, but the hotel lacks a spa 鈥?massages would have made the 3 AM pirate songs emanating from the lobby much more tolerable.

"hotel_194","hotel_8804","Really comfortable bed We spent the weekend at the Hyatt in downtown Dallas. We just needed a little getaway, so I went to priceline and bid $50 for a 4 star hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to get the beautiful Hyatt for such a great price. It was our anniversary weekend! The hotel was very busy, but check-in was a breeze - the valet parked our car and the bellhop had our bags up to the room, all within 10 minutes of arrival. We were on the 15th floor, facing downtown. You could hear the trains coming through Union Station, but it wasn't that bad. We ordered room service twice, both times it came on rollaway tables and within half an hour of ordering. The service was superb. The room was kind of small but immaculate. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. It was hard watching tv because of the way the furniture is placed - and the room never seemed to cool off, I woke up several times because it was hot - I like it around 70 degrees and I don't think it got below 75 - so, for most people I am sure that would be okay. The view of downtown at night is really beautiful and we had a great anniversary weekend.

"hotel_194","hotel_6373","All renewable power and excellent service, too We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Dallas for nearly a week as part of a conference. The property is HUGE and well-maintained and renovated.Positives:-great coffee shop in lobby area so you're never without that latte-many dining options, including a very pleasant open restaurant that's great for breakfast or lunch (although the service was so attentive it was sometimes difficult to finish a sentence)-the big observation tower bar is a great place to get together with spectacular views-the bellman (I think his name was Steve) has been there for 24 years and loved the place and knew everything-nicely decorated rooms-you can request a mini fridge - empty-room service and housekeeping service was lickety-split-HVAC system maintained indoor comfort - which is more than I can say for most hotel rooms that are either too hot or too cold!-the hotel purchases ALL of its energy from renewable sources. Yay!Negatives:-closet was miniscule, which was a struggle for two women with a full set of conference, shopping and casual wardrobe for a week-the bathroom was designed, which always leads to something that looks great but is non-functional - in this case it was hooks for the towels instead of racks so that they could completely dry. Sigh. I would be delighted if the trend to use hip designers to do things would go away and we could get hotels back to focusing on function.-Like many large Hyatt Regencies, the room was a little on the small side - you can only really watch TV from bed, and the work space is only one table (Mariott does a much better job with work space), but these were minor issues and overall things worked pretty well.","Aug 15, 2006","3","3",5,5,5,5,4,6,4,"3.5","$242"

"hotel_194","hotel_4594","Nice stay for a get-a-way My husband suprised me with a trip out of town for a concert. We stayed at the Hyatt in Dallas. It was within walking distance to West End. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. There is a mini-refrigerator, coffee maker, and blowdryer available in the room. The parking required an additional fee. In addition, if you wanted to use the wireless internet, that was additional $10 per day. It did have its drawbacks, however, we enjoyed the Regency Club. The snacks and breakfast were good! Additionally, the staff were friendly and helpful. The pool was outside on top of a rooftop area and not so luxurious (like what I am used to from other Hyatt hotels). The hotel is designed to host conferences so it is spacious. If you are looking for a resort feel, this may seem too business-like.

"hotel_194","hotel_2158","Clear evidence that cleaning rooms not a priority Recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Dallas. Was assigned a non-smoking room and I admit that the hotel could not be held accountable for previous occupants having flouted conditions and smoked in the room, however, I would expect that a hotel should clean a room before the next occupant and there was clearly evidence that this was not the case on this occasion.One day into my 3 day stay, I dropped a pen to the floor and it rolled under the bed. On bending down to retrieve it, I found that there was a cigarette lighter under the bed. Obviously, cleaning under the beds is not a priority at the Hyatt. (I shuddered to think what other things could be found under beds - especially with the Deca rabble in town!).I reported this finding to the Front Desk, confirming that I was not the smoker or owner of the lighter and indicated that this wasn't to be expected in such a hotel and asked for the cleaners to remove it.Returned to the room later in the day, bent down and lo and behold, the lighter was still there. Went down to the Front Desk to complain again and asked to see a Duty Manager. One of the Front Desk personnel claimed to be but looked non-plussed, mumbled an apology (I think) and claimed that they would get the lighter removed.Obviously there is no communication between Front Desk/Management and the cleaning staff because by the time I checked out, the lighter still remained under the bed. Absolutely disgusting.I left a number of notes hidden around the room so that if the next occupant was to find the same lighter, they would at least have some history on how long the item had been under there and the current occupant could be sure that their room isn't being cleaned.","May 8, 2006","11","7",4,1,1,2,1,2,1,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_3212","This place needs a bulldozer Let me start by saying that I had high expectations when staying at a 4 star hotel, especially one like the Hyatt, where their quality is exceptional in most cases. Unfortunately, this hotel did not meet my expectations. Fortunately, I got a great deal ($89) on Priceline, so I didn't get ripped off, otherwise I would have demanded a refund and stayed elsewhere.When I first arrived at the hotel in my cab, the staff completely ignored me. They were moderately busy, but I still saw a couple of bell guys or valet guys standing around, so they could have came over and assisted. I ended up carrying my own bags over to one of the bell carts, and wheeling it into the hotel myself! Bad way to start off the stay.I used the self check-in, which was a mistake, because you can't ask for a different room if you don't like the one it assigns you. So, when I got in my room, which was on the 3rd floor, I called down to the front desk, asking for a higher floor. They asked me to come back down, so I had to cart all my luggage back down (thank goodness I still had the cart), and then when I got to the desk, it was so big, I didn't get the person I talked to on the phone, so then they had to go find the person I talked to and ask them. They moved me to the 22nd floor in the Atrium Tower, where the view was MUCH nicer. And, finally, this time around, the bell person saw me pushing the cart myself, and offered to take my luggage up to my room.The re-assigned room they gave me had a beautiful view of downtown Dallas. The room appeared to be clean on the surface, but further inspection found that there were a lot of rough edges. For example, the heating/AC vents were caked in about 10 years worth of dust, which is really bad if you are an allergy sufferer. The furniture and decor in the room were of a southwest nature, I felt like I was in Albuquerque, NM! Unfortunately, everything in the room is dated, and obviously needs to be remodeled, especially the wallpaper, and the fabulous popcorn ceiling!The bathroom was adequate size, and appeared to be recently updated with granite counter, new tile in the shower, etc. I liked the double doors with the frosted glass windows on them to enter the bathroom, about the only nice touch in the decor that I appreciated. Unfortunately, the next morning when I took a shower, there was ZERO water pressure in the shower. It had a messaging shower head, but there wasn't enough pressure. So, I called down to the front desk, asked them to have maintenance come and remove the pressure regulator valve, and when I came back that evening, they had done so. The water pressure was then too high, but it was MUCH better then having no water pressure in the shower. Amenities in the room? Standard hotel fare, ironing board, coffee maker, hair dryer, soaps  shampoos, etc. NO MINI BAR or fridge in the room, so I had to use the bathroom sink as my ice chest to keep my sodas and beers cold. The ice holder they give you does not come with a plastic bag, and mine was dirty, so I had to clean it out before putting ice in it! The towels feel like sandpaper, so bring your own if you don't like that effect after taking a nice relaxing shower or bath. The internet access costs $5.55 a day with tax, and it's wireless, but it totally sucks. I got faster speeds using the wireless card through my cell phone company while in the room.The bed was fairly comfortable. It appeared to be a pillowtop mattress. There were plenty of fluffy pillows on the bed, and the comforter may have been a down comforter. Thank goodness they at least have the sleep part of the room down, after all, that's why we need a hotel room!The TV was an absolute joke. Standard 27 inch black hotel TV with keyboard  remote, internet access, PPV movies, etc... Highly overpriced, so I didn't order anything. I guess they didn't want to block the view, so they put the TV on the LEFT wall, and it's facing...The desk, not the bed. So if you want to watch TV in bed, you really won't be able to! The fitness center was alright... Had a very dated and worn look to it, but they had replaced some of the equipment with newer LifeFitness elliptical machines and treadmills, some of which even had your own personal tv built into the machine. There didn't appear to be much in the way of free weights, but that's pretty standard for most hotels to not have a REAL fitness center. Water was NOT complimentry, they had a vending machine so you had to pay for drinking water.I did not use any of the restaurants, but I did go to the revolving 50 story lounge, which is the main attraction of this hotel, so you would think they would want to make a good impression right? Wrong! It's an absolute dump!!! The decor is completely dated, the lights are too bright, so at night, instead of seeing the georgeous view of the entire city, all you see is a reflection of yourself sipping a cocktail! The windows are even scratched and dirty. The music sucks too, they were playing the same song over and over and over, i counted 8 times, and I finally asked them to change the music, so then they put on another CD and it kept skipping, so they shut the whole thing off. Oh, and it closes at 10:30! What kind of bar closes that early!?! So can you get a good drink at this bar? No! They charge $8 bucks for a martini, but it's mostly sugar, and very little alcohol.The nail in the coffin for my rating on this hotel was the pool. You would expect a hotel this size (2 towers, and 30+ stories) would have a large pool, and a really nice relaxing cabana area for you to enjoy your vacation! Not this place. The pool and sundeck are an absolute dump. The size of the pool is about the same as the large hot tub they had when I stayed at Raddison in Phoenix... I kid you not, I think you could fit about 5 people in there. Everything is so worn and dated, and it's not inviting at all, so I spent zero time there, and was highly disapointed. Parking is $18 dollars a day for valet, and you can call down for your car during non peak hours, it usually takes about 5-10 minutes, so that was convenient, and it included in and out priveledges. Be aware, the hotel must have bought off the city of Dallas, because there is plenty of on street parking, but it is ENTIRELY LABELED AS NO PARKING - TOW AWAY ZONE, so you can't park on the street unless you want to get towed. There is a self park lot for $10 bucks a day, but it does not include in and out priveledges, and you have to hike up a little hill to get back to the hotel. There is a train station adjacent to the hotel property with a tunnel that takes you there. The tunnel is kind of cool, it has a lot of history about Dallas with interactive talking displays. The train can get you to the hot spots downtown such as the west end, it's just the next stop right next to the hotel, and also to the airport if you take the commuter train, so you might not even need a car. Do not try to walk anywhere from this hotel, the neighborhood is very shady, and you have to walk through a tunnel to get to downtown, which might be kinda dangerous at night.Overall, I would never stay at this hotel again. The Hyatt needs to revoke their franchise on this place, and this place needs to be bulldozed and rebuilt... Or, I guess they might be able to save this beautiful landmark if they just remodeled the entire thing. It's far from being a 4 star hotel as priceline rates it!","Apr 4, 2006","18","14",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3.5","$242"

"hotel_194","hotel_3987","Not good enough My wife and I stayed here over Christmas and were disappointed with the bland quality of the hotel. Though our room had a lovely and comfortable king-sized bed, it lacked adequate closet space (a couple of shelves and five hangers on an open rack), had a poorly positioned TV with just a few channels, and had no mini-bar (but had bottled water at $5 each!) Any Holiday Inn or other mid-range hotel could better this!Customer service at the Hyatt was also average. Counter staff couldn鈥檛 manage a smile or friendly greeting either at check-in or departure, and a bartender took ten minutes to bring us our check, even though we were two of just four people at the bar 鈥?he even found time to serve and check a new customer before finally tending to us. Even though restaurant waiters and porters were friendly, there was a discernible lack of customer focus鈥et, of course, staff expected to be tipped as if it was their divine right.The other highly annoying aspect of the Hyatt is the lack of parking. Options are valet parking at $18 per night or a nearby lot that costs a whopping $8 each time you leave! How can a hotel with 1,200 rooms have no reasonable parking facilities, especially in a city like Dallas where a car is essential? With so many decent mid- and upper-range hotels to choose from in Dallas, it surprised me that the Hyatt has done nothing to attract visitors. Perhaps it relies on business and convention customers; but my wife and I won鈥檛 be going there again.","Jan 9, 2006","12","12",4,4,1,5,1,5,1,"3.5","$242"

You may eat on the top with a 360 view of all Dallas but food is only regular. We pay US$10 for internet use.

Be warned this is a very busy hotel if there are conventions or meetings in town. Mary Kay uses this as one of their hotels for the month long convention. Parking can be a hassle, especially valet. I went out to play a round of golf Sunday morning and came back around noon only to wait 45 minutes to have my car parked. This is basically the only negative for the hotel. I was upgraded to an executive room at check-in. The room was plenty big and overlooked downtown. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Be sure to check out Reunion Tower for the view.........not the food. Seemed a little dirty and run down since the last time I went up in 1996.

"hotel_194","hotel_4308","Hotel was ok, but the City of Dallas itself is Boring. Stayed at the Hyatt for a week long conference. The lobby was clean and inviting. The front desk staff were very friendly. My room was average size with an average decor. My first problem started when I noticed a wet spot above the abode. It appears the bathroom above mine had a huge leak. The front desk immediately moved me to another room. I had a $50.00 per diem that didn't last me. If you are a three meal a day person like I am, plan on shopping at a market and bringing it back with you to your room. The hotel restaurants were very expensive as well as the close by restaurants. Downtown Dallas was a huge disappointment. Downtown is just a place where people work, but definitely don't play in. At night the city is a ghost town. If you weren't planning on renting a car, you better. The trains are some of the slowest I've ever been on. One major complaint I had with the city of Dallas was the area where JFK was assasinated. Walking by the area (Deeley Park/Square?) you would have never thought that a United States President was shot and killed there. The grassy nole?...wasn't green at all. There isn't any type of memorial set up or even a nice plaque. All I saw were red (X's) on the street. ??I would never ever go back to that city. And I'm a Cowboy fan.

"hotel_194","hotel_10560","Four Days at the Hyatt We stayed here for 4 days/3 nights in the middle of May. The hotel from the outside looks a lot larger than it seems from the inside and visually looks nice with the glass windows. Overall, the staff was friendly, especially the guest services section and the bar staff. We did have 1 instance where a security person got a little drunk with power when we tried to grab a drink from the hotel bar before it closed and asked us to immediately leave. Other than that, and one of the waitstaff in the restaurant trying to steer us to seat near the kitchen at breakfast instead of the waterfall so we could be in her section, it was fine. Connected to the hotel is the Reunion Tower, which overlooks the city. It's very high up and has a view of the entire city, however only reinforces the fact that there's not much to see there. There are 2 restaurant/bars on top of the tower for those who desire to drink with a view. The Dallas Morning News is provided complimentary each morning and obtaining extra amenities, such as cream, is never a problem. The workout facility is very good when it comes to cardio as there are numerous choices, plus 5 TV screens (they provide a headset), but the variety of the lifting machines are poor. The environment for working out is dull as there's no music in the background so you definitely have to motivate yourself. There's an outdoor pool, which is one of the smaller pools that I've ever seen. A jacuzzi is located about 50 yards of the pool. The hotel bar does have 2 pool tables, TV's, a jukebox and some type of bowling game, which is a welcome change from the traditional stuffy hotel bar.Regarding the city itself, there is not much to do during the day. The hotel is located about 10 minutes from the JFK Museum and where he was shot. You can easily walk to downtown Dallas, but there's really not much to see or do there. A better option for a day trip is to take a train to Fort Worth. At night, the west end has a lot of restaurants to choose from (Steak, Tex-Mex, BBQ) and bars with an outdoor view. The marketplace has shops perfect for those looking to buy cowboy hats to symbolize their trip. For those looking for other nightlife near by, both Deep Ellum and Lower Greenville have a strip of bars and clubs, however from what we were told, people have been shying away from Deep Ellum due to a shooting that took place in 2004. Both areas are about a 10 minute cab ride from the hotel. Gilley's Dallas is also about a mile from the hotel and offers a honky tonk atmosphere, but the DJ also plays hip-hop/dance music when the live band is through. Overall, I'm glad that we stayed at this hotel for the location to the city as opposed to staying in the market center hotels. Other than eating/drinking there's not a lot to do in Dallas, but for each their own.","May 24, 2005","8","5",5,5,1,5,1,5,1,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_1114","Good quality hotel in great location .... be careful what room you get! Got this hotel through Priceline for less than 拢50 a night. Rooms are large and comfortable (by european standards). Restaurant was reasonably priced for a hotel. The advantages and disadvantages of this hotel are its location. Very close to Convention Centre, West End District and JFK museum. Unfortunately its situated between Union Station on one side and a freeway on the other - the noise can be a problem if your not a heavy sleeper. I stayed here for 2 nights and was given a room which backed onto the elevator shaft - more noise. I asked to change rooms and this was done without question. Hotel is very popular for conventions and conferences and as such can appear very busy. All hotel staff were pleasant and polite but were more efficient than friendly.","Apr 29, 2005","6","6",5,5,1,5,1,4,1,"3.5","$242"
"hotel_194","hotel_1703","Convention Hotel I stayed in this hotel for a 3 day convention in mid April '05. The location of the Hyatt in the West End of downtown Dallas is terrific. It's not really within walking distance of anything, but a short shuttle or cab ride is easy enough.The hotel lobby is nice. There are plenty of restaurants and an underground walkway to Reunion Station. There's a ton of meeting space. If you're staying here on vacation, keep in mind that it's likely to be crowded with conventioners.Rooms are average. Stayed in the Skyline section of the hotel overlooking the train station. Let me start by saying that it took a day or two to get used to the trains blowing their horns all night as they passed by. I don't know if it would be any better on the other side of the hotel. Woke me up several times. The bed was nice. It sits up high and I had to almost climb into it. But the TV sits low in a cabinet and I couldn't see it over my feet. There's really nothing special about the rooms.The cost was $175/night for the cheapest room when I stayed. You're paying for the location. There's no breakfast, happy hour, etc. High speed internet access is another $10 per day. For what Hyatt considers to be a higher end hotel, it's too bad they nickle and dime you for these extras. There's a fee for parking, but I'm not sure how much it is since I took a shuttle from the airport and didn't get a rental. I know it's fairly expensive.The valets are terrific. There's a ton of them around and they do a good job of securing cabs. In fact, there are usually a dozen or so cabs lined up outside the hotel. The front desk staff was pleasant, but nothing special. Housekeeping was adequate.Overall, this is not a bad hotel, but nothing special except for the location and meeting space. I'd certainly stay there again if my company was paying for it for another convention. But I wouldn't vacation there.","Apr 29, 2005","3","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"3.5","$242"

"hotel_196","hotel_6053","Grossed completely out !!! The website on this hotel was extremely deceiving. I would have never booked if I had read the reviews that are now posted. The only review I read was a good one. Don't know when it was given...must have been in another life. Walking up on the hotel - we immediately started to question our stay. Not kept up and smelled a little stale. Desk clerks very unprofessional. Got to our room - and decided we needed to wear flip-flops at all times in the room. We could not relocate - it was OU/Tex game. Our friends in the room next to ours found dirty magazines in the bedside table - these were discusting - photos of old people in compromising positions. There we no ice machines to be found in the hotel. We went to 3 different floors - all the machines were pulled out of the wall. We had coffee in the room, no coffee pot. We found hair in the bathroom (small curley ones - yes, you guessed it). The blanket on the bed was old and had holes. The sheet on our bed was paper thin and during the night it popped up from the mattress. If I had only known what I was about to sleep on.....the mattress was ripped all over and filthy. Not a little ripped - but big time ripped and filthy, not a little stained - major and there was no mattress pad. I was totally discusted and furious. It made me sick to my stomach that I had paid $140.00 to slept on that mattress. I can't believe a hotel is allowed to have these types of mattresses in their hotel. I could go on and on as to what we found but I'm sure you get the picture. I let the desk clerk know of my discust when I left. She had no comment. BAD CHOICE! I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR MY WORST ENEMY!

I booked the room on line , but unfortunately did not read the fine print! After checking just a few hours later with Trip adviser and reading some of the reviews I had some questions! The next morning I called the desk and asked about some of the reviews and the lady said.  If you want to stay ok if you want to cancel go ahead but we keep all the money. After checking they had already charged my card the full amount within 10 hours and basically told me to bug off. I went ahead and canceled the room called my credit card company but it was too late to stop payment! I booked a room at Mariott and look forward to a great game! However they were the rudest bunch I have ever spoke with and I am sure they have a ton of cancelations and this is why they charge and give no refund.

The pool smelled and tasted like dirty lake water. You could tell there had not been any maintenance done to the pool area in years. A friend of mine stayed in another room and they could not even get there door to shut!!!!!The only good thing was they kept clean towels and sheets in the room.I would never recommend this hotel to people with children,college aged girls traveling alone, or elderly people.

"hotel_196","hotel_8303","Don't be fooled! Good value hotel! Well, I must say that I was pretty afraid to come to the hotel after reading all of these reviews posted. However, when I first arrived, and throughout my stay at the plaza, I could not believe how wrong and misleading every one of these reviews was.. My stay, as you will read further, was certainly an enjoyable one as I spent three nights of my 4th of July weekend at the hotel.Check-in took about 2 min total. I booked my reservations online with the discounted $45.99 rate and reserved three nights in total for three people. My stay was actually split into two different reservations since I decided to add an additional night later during my vacation preparations. The front desk had not trouble at all with this and was able to continue my three night stay without having any problems. I did however have a little trouble with the first set of keys but the second set worked out just fine for the rest of the stay. Housekeeping was very nice and I got additional towels at the front desk upon request.Now, for the room: clean, organized, well furnished and free of foul scent of any kind. The room was like any other La Quintal or holiday inn room with an added bit of room to boot. The bathroom was clean, spacious and had all the amenities that I could ever want including shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, face soap, toothpaste, etc. etc.. The balcony looked safe and was very nice to walk out onto. The only thing I saw wrong with the room was a little coke stain near the door, that鈥檚 it! I was very pleased with the room, room service, guest service desk, etc.I went swimming in the pool after a light jog in downtown Dallas and it was amazing! The water was very warm and the area around the pool was nice and clean. Yes, there are a few holes in the wall area and the hot tub area is closed off but everything is still very nice. I鈥檓 not sure what people were expecting when they stayed at the Plaza but lets just say that I was very pleased once I saw for myself after reading the reviews. I continued to swim every morning and my buddies did the same as I reported how nice the facility really was..The wireless internet, although somewhat annoying to have to use the service in the lobby area only, works just fine and I enjoyed being able to use the internet during my stay.The 鈥渇itness center鈥?facility was a bit bare with only a couple of treadmills and workout stations. This is probably the worst part of the hotel: dark, stained, dirty, broken windows and cracked walls, etc. There were some pieces of equipment available that could prove useful if you were just determined to get some kind of a workout in. Actually, the center had about the same number of machines as any other hotel, just not as inviting and clean, big deal, I didn鈥檛 come to the Plaza to work out and neither should you. The hotel is somewhat of a 鈥渄eserted palace鈥?as I call it because there is nobody apparently taking advantage of the nice facility that the hotel really does encompass in some areas. The fitness center and outside appearance of the hotel is about the worst but areas such as the pool, rooms, lobby and hallway areas are just as good as any other basic hotel if not nicer. Sure, the hotel needs some work and the facility does show some wear in some areas, but you simply can not beat the online price that the hotel offers. You may not want to stay at the hotel for your honeymoon or anniversary, but the hotel is excellent for single men or college guys just looking for a decent place to stay downtown while they are enjoying the Dallas area. Not only was I able to enjoy the area but I also enjoyed the hotel鈥檚 accommodations as well.Except for the one night (Thursday), I did not see any homeless people, drug dealers, or *cough* women.. down in the parking lot like everyone on here is warning about. I did notice some 鈥渜uestionable鈥?guests checking in and out of the hotel, but these people would not harm a fly as they are probably from smaller towns and communities wishing to visit a larger metro area and experience the 鈥渃ity life鈥? Like everyone鈥檚 鈥渨arnings鈥?on this posting, I too am posting my warning too you: do not let these posting scare you, they are posted by mid-aged women and married couple who believe they have found a good deal at a five star hotel located in downtown Dallas, which simply isn鈥檛 going to happen. For the money, this hotel is fabulous. I am actually writing the rough draft to this review while sitting by the indoor pool on my second day of my stay. I am so confident in my initial impression that I decided to write this review to give those out there a sense of hope who want a cheap hotel for a good stay. I got nightmares at the thought that I had already prepaid for my stay at the Plaza and just now finding out how 鈥渉orrible鈥?it really is. Please, do not be worried, this hotel is not bad at all. If you read all of these other reviews and actually visit the hotel, you will be as surprised as I was when you arrive.. all is well.","Jul 13, 2008","1","1",5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"2","$63"
"hotel_196","hotel_7251","Pay the extra to stay elsewhere!!! I booked this hotel for two reasons; It was extremely cheap, and it was the closest hotel to the convention center.I got what I paid for. The area wasn't the best. The rooms seem to be booked out by the hour moreso than by the night. I was warned not to walk anywhere after dark, because it wasn't safe.On my second day there, the maid left my door open, and when I showed back up, I found my camera was missing. I contacted the front desk and sat in the lobby until they got a hold of the manager. The front desk clerk, Sandra Aldarado, never called the manager like she had said she did. It wasn't until 2 hours later, and I was totally irate, that she finally called the manager on her cell phone, and finally let me speak to her. The manager said that she would handle the situation in the morning. When the morning came, all that was done, was to fill out an incident report. I had to repeatedly insist on calling the police, and having them file a police report.It's amazing that Sandra, the front desk clerk, could reach the housekeeper Janice Curry, to find out that she never saw a camera in my room. I guess she has a habbit of going through peoples luggage or, just flat out lying when she knows she screwed up. The really amazing thing, was that Sandra couldn't reach the manager, but her lies kept telling me that the manager was on her way, and would be back soon.I would advise staying away from this hotel, at the very least until Tiffany Macguire, the manager, Sandra Aldarado, the front desk clerk, and Janice Curry, the housekeeper, are all fired.Maybe once the owners do some housecleaning, the place will improve.P.S. The hot tub has been broken for quite some time, with no intentions of repairing it.P.P.S. There is no bar, lounge, restaurant, or room service.P.P.P.S. The wireless network connection only works in the lobby, and the business office computer is extremely old, slow and out of date, and also corrupted with viruses.","Jul 12, 2008","1","1",2,2,3,3,2,2,2,"2","$63"

Not in the greatest area of town - next to the Interstate on the edge of downtown. Homeless people frequent the area - somewhat distressing to see from the comfort of your hotel. Did'nt feel threatened by them, though. Would not advise walking around this area at night.3. No restaurant/bar and none within the immediate areaThe Pro's1. Very close to downtown - walkable and is safe during daylight hours.2. Inexpensive. At $50 per night, I could'nt complain.3.Rooms were clean and comfortable ( apart from the windows, that is ! ).4.

"hotel_196","hotel_8169","Complimentary Crack Pipe! I should have acknowledged all of the red flags. Our university travel clerk booked this for me after I sent her the link. It's so close to where I needed to be, I thought it couldn't be that bad.Wrong! Despite my confirmation page showing the promo rate of $45.99/night, the hotel clerk wanted me to sign for a totla of $153.xx. I called her out on it, and she said whoever booked must not have pushed the promo button, so the rate would be at least $119/night. Uh... where did the other 30 bucks come from? She finally relented and provided a receipt for me to sign with the total of $53.xx. Odd how it came to exactly $100 less than the original total.I got to my room, walked down the shabby halls with dingy carpet and peeling wallpaper, to find the room immediately to my left had no lock or handle...just holes through which anyone could peer. My own room was secure (especially once I propped a chair and ironing board up under the handle). It was too late for me to attempt finding another hotel, so I knew I was in for the night. I bring my own dream sack so I wasn't terribly concerned about unclean sheets. While looking for a note pad, I stumbled upon a crack pipe. Yes, a real one. I work with cops and have attended various conferences...enough to identify drug paraphanelia easily enough. I was surprised to find I had internet in my room despite the notice that it's available in their business center. (2 couches in the lobby.... if you can kick off one of the hobos)In the morning, when I was checking out, I informed the desk clerk of my pipe find. Her response, Oh. Someone must not have cleaned the room very well. !?!?!?While visiting the Dallas Police Dept., and relaying my encounter, they all rolled their eyes and confirmed they often see prostitutes entering and leaving. They insinuated the extra $100 charge was their pimp fee..... uh..... I looked like a prostitute... nice....This used to be owned by Ramada and when it was first sold to this private investor, they've promised it's under construction and will soon be renovated.

"hotel_196","hotel_8691","Good deal for the price. I booked through the hotel website and received a great price of $40 per night. I reserved a month early found no problems registering online or calling and confirming the hotel reservation.For all the bad reviews, I was talking to an employee for the hotel and the hotel will be renovated in a few months. Another hotel chain will take over and the name along with the old building and interior will all change. Therefore, if you need an inexpensive place to stay, then you only have a limited time.Anyhow, the check in process was easy. No problems. The lobby shows it's age and 1 of the 3 elevators is out of order. The room was clean. The bathroom was clean, floor seemed vacuumed and the beds were made. The room furnishings, carpet, walls all show their age and the balcony is off limits. The A/C and heat worked fine. No problems with hot or cold water and there was daily room service. The pool doesn't seem clean, and the pool area is dark and not very inviting. I don't swim anyways so it didn't matter. From the outside, the hotel looks old and dated.I was hesitant to stay here because of the prior reviews, but I think the prior reviewers had higher expectations. However, for $40 a night, the price can not be beat. I was attending an event at the convention center and was easily within walking distance. Basically, the rooms are clean, the water was hot/cold, the heating and cooling worked. Sure, there are no warm cookies when you check-in, and the room isn't furnished with the newest and greatest.

"hotel_196","hotel_8783","Caveat emptor! (Let the buyer beware) My father is a 79 year old dentist from Oklahoma City who needed to attend the recent Southwestern Dental Conference in Dallas. All of the rooms at the host hotels where he usually stays were booked (Adolphus, Magnolia, Fairmont) so we new we would have to look around the Dallas Market or up Central Expressway. The Dallas Plaza is 1/2 mile from the Dallas Convention Center. The convenience to the exhibits was what drew us to this hotel. I had just been in Dallas on business myself and we have been going to downtown Dallas since I was a child 40 years ago so, we knew the area was potentially rough and possibly dangerous, but the price was amazing. I told him he might have to bop his way into the hotel each night. He informed me that he did not receive the King bed as requested but the room was large with two double beds and a good TV. He did complain that two out of three lamps in the room did not work. I called to see if he had arrived his first night by 6:00 p.m., it took several attempts to get anyone to pick up the phone, but once they did answer they were courteous. However, that courtesy was not a standard of the Dallas Plaza. I called the hotel two days later to find out when he would be returning to OKC and to give him weather updates. Again it took at least 150 rings before anyone answered the phone. Then the front desk person said they couln't connect me unless I knew which Room # he was staying in and that they couldn't (or rather wouldn't) connect me. I had to tell them he was a 79 year old man traveling by himself before they eventually connected me. BOTTOM LINE: WE GOT WHAT WE EXPECTED! YOU CANT FIND A HOTEL IN DALLAS FOR LESS THAN $100 PER NIGHT AVG. UNLESS IT IS A FLOP HOUSE (and then it's still liable to be a flop house unless it is costing $149 or better). I sill would have expected better customer service. Just because a place is older and has had some wear and tear on it, doesn't mean that the customer service should also be lacking. I can't wait to go back to Dallas next month and check the place out in person, however, I won't be staying there! But I can always use some comic relief when I'm traveling. The other reviews were awesome. Everyone should watch the movie Four Rooms. I'll bet it is a similar kind of place.

I looked at many hotels but wanting to spend my money partying instead of on a room I wasn't going to be at all that much, this hotel was priced right. OMG! I'm glad I was half drunk when I got there. I had read the reviews, but I was a dumb ---. I thought how bad could it really be? After all there were 2 good reviews most recently.OK no. I should have heeded the previous reviews. The place was absolutely the most horrid thing I have ever seen. Even through my so-called rose colored glasses. Mold was growing on the inside of the windows and up the walls! How does that happen? Razor wire in the parking lot, the lanterns in the entrance were hanging askew. How hard is it to take a screwdriver and fix that? Broken marble in the lobby, filthy walls, bathroom had some kind of hair all in the tub and on the sink counter. Who stayed there the night before, Bigfoot? Ok ladies I know you would not like this place. Guys??? Well 99% of you wouldn't either but I was raised with 5 boys so I know about that other 1% of you. You'd shrug and think whatever, but I also know that you would not even think of taking your lady there. I consider myself to be a pretty tough girl, with a famine twist ;0) But I'm sorry. Even impaired where I was like that 1% of you guys out there, I just couldn't stay in this place. I couldn't even lock my door. Now what kind of craziness would that have been if I ended up next to some strange homeless man? The lady at the desk told me that on cold nights they allow the homeless who are sitting in the parking lot come in the lobby to get out of the cold. With a room that had no real way to secure my door, and having been advised when I asked to change rooms that all the rooms were like that. I just couldn鈥檛 hang with it. I had to beat feet out of that place. I'm glad they are looking out for the homeless, but maybe they should apply for some aide and make that a homeless shelter. As far as being a hotel, they aren't. There was another review I read that said if over half the reviews are bad don't stay. Listen to it. That person was right. People don't just write these reviews for their health.

"hotel_196","hotel_8922","How can they stay in business? Our first clue should have been that the cab driver had never heard of the hotel. When we finally found the place, it was in a very run-down empty area of the south side lined with razor wire and we had to look pretty hard to find the sign. There were barely any other cars in the parking lot, and another newly arrived set of guests looked about as dazed as we did. Our hearts sank, but from outside, the lobby looked OK, so we let the taxi go. Closer inspection of the lobby revealed how run-down that looked too. On entering the room, we had to search for a light that actually worked and were disappointed in how dirty and old everything looked and smelled. We were afraid to turn down the bed. The view consisted of pure cement. We found a room at a nearby Hampton Inn (which had a 100% satisfaction guarantee, bigger, clean rooms and very nice beds) for only $40 more per night. When we called the desk about the cancellation policy, the woman didn't even ask why-she was probably used to it. She informed us that we'd have to pay for that night and have our travel agent cancel the second night, then hung up. Huh? She wouldn't give us a receipt for the first night either, saying we had to get that through the travel agent as well. While we were waiting for a cab (she had to give the driver directions), another customer was at the desk trying to lodge a complaint, but nobody was sure when the manager would be in. We have been home for 4 days and have yet to get a receipt. They keep promising to fax a copy. I don't expect that will happen. Between the text and the photo here, this is some marketing job. I can't believe that anyone would rate this place any higher than a 2. Were the others at a different hotel, or do they just not have any standards? I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before going.","Feb 13, 2007","4","4",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"2","$63"

The first day I went running, I did not feel safe in broad daylight. The worst part is that the hotel phone messaging service does not work and the hotel doesn't bother to tell you this. I had several friends call, and when the messaging service didn't work, left messages at the fron t desk - all of which were lost. When I complained to the manager, his attitude was worse than the front desk. The front desk in general was worthless, no one knew how to get anywhere in the area.

"hotel_197","hotel_10367","NIce Hotel We stayed at the Sheraton Suites for the 2009 Cotton Bowl. I booked the room through the Starwood Resorts website because I found a special there that was buy one night and get one night half off. This special was the best rate I could get - it was $129 the first night and $64.50 the second night. The hotel was about 1.5 miles from downtown, which was very convenient and we didn't have any trouble navigating to the places we went downtown. The rooms were very nice and had plenty of room for the two of us. The breakfast was on special for $10.95/person and was really good - I am not sure how much it normally costs though. I did see on the website when I booked there were room rates that included breakfast, just not for the rate I booked. The hotel also offers a shuttle within 5 miles of the hotel. The driver was very nice and instead of dropping us off at the pearl street dart station, he took us all the way to Cotton Bowl stadium. The only complaint I have about the shuttle was when we wanted to go downtown one night, they wanted us to get on it an hour later. When I booked the hotel, I was under the impression that the shuttle ran whenever you wanted to go somewhere as long as it was available. Also we called from downtown one night to see if it was in the area, but they told us it was done for the night. It wasn't a big deal, but other hotels that i have stayed in with shuttles are much more accomodating. All in all I would definitely stay here again and we definitely saved money by staying here instead of downtown.

"hotel_197","hotel_8914","Nice hotel - great renovations The hotel is still in the process of being remodeled. When I checked in, all the rooms are done however there is some furniture missing (a few end tables), artwork, etc. from the room but nothing you would need to stay there. A letter on the desk states that these items are on the way from overseas. The rooms are beautiful. New carpets, drapes, fixtures, granite top countertops in bar area and bathroom. Good neutral colors - contemporary earth tones. The cooling system is great. NO wall unit and that counts a lot for me. The air comes through vents near the ceiling. As the other reviews have suggested, there are 2 flat screen TV's that are literally across the wall from each other. one in the bedroom and one in the main part of the suite. There is a small refrig. in my room. The beds are nice - very comfortable. The bedroom is small, but not impossible to get around in. I'm a big guy, 6'4 and 300 lbs, and I didn't have a problem so that puts most others under me in being able to get around in a small space. Bathroom is very modern and fairly spacious.For the negatives - you pay $7.95 a night for parking. WHY? I don't get it... there is a sign at the front desk that states don't leave valuables in the car, which is something you should never do. It also says there have been break-ins in the immediate area. If you pay for parking, and this is not a garage with a monitored gate...then what is the parking fee for if there is no security? What does the customer get for their money here? Also, you must pay $10 a night for Internet service. Come on...most places offer it for free. Its Wayport so you know you don't have trouble connecting which is a good thing since some places (many in fact) offer free Internet that a lot of the times is DOWN.I don't like the nickel and diming...but if its for a good reason such as security to park your car, I really don't mind paying for parking. Enjoy your stay here, its going to be a nice place in 3 months or so. I got a rate here for $50 a night on Priceline but that may not last for too much longer when the hotel is completely done.","Jul 23, 2008","1","1",6,5,5,6,4,5,4,"3","$161"
"hotel_197","hotel_7185","Very Nice Renovations I read many negative reviews about this hotel after having booked it for our vacation, so I was anxious about what I might find. I had also known it was under renovation and was scheduled to be completed by July 2008. We arrived late in the evening July 3 and the lobby was being painted, obviously to avoid inconvenience of customers, but this made me a bit more anxious. The man at the front desk very friendly and speedy. When I got to the door of our room, I was still anxious not knowing what to expect, but was very surprised to see a room that looked brand new. It was modern, stylish and clean. It was equipped with two flat screen televisions a new sofa-bed and of course the famous Sweet Sleeper bed. I was very impressed and would definately stay here again.If you have seen the negative reviews, the hotel must have been in sad shape before they renovated it.

I would assume, based on the previous reviews that this hotel had been mismanaged and not taken care of. I can say with all sincerity, that if you were to stay at the hotel again, you would see night and day differences. I was extremely apprehensive about staying at this hotel after reading previous reviews. As you will see in my other reviews, I am brutally honest with my comments. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying close to downtown Dallas. Please keep in mind, they are still remodeling, so there are some issues with that, but nothing that interrupted my stay.Pros-Location, location, location! Very close to downtown and an easy drive also. Easy back roads to get downtown when the interstate is backed up.-Clean rooms, hallways, laundry facility, workout facility and dining facility-Food from restaurant was very good (breakfast buffet in the mornings and a club croissant sandwich a couple of times)-Stayed in a King Suite. Rooms were large. 2 LG LCD flat screen monitors. Bedroom was tight, but living room area was large and allowed for a lot of space. Easy to spread out with a laptop. Wet bar was a nice touch also.-Pool looked clean but I didn't jump in.-Staff was negotiable on check out time and seemed courteous with other folks in our groupCons-Pay $9.95 for 24hrs of wireless. I have stayed in 2 star hotels with free wireless. (Business center was one computer in a cubby hole in the lobby. Signs posted makes it look like they are still revamping the business center)-Was told $2 flat rate for calls out on toll free numbers (had a conference call). Ended up getting charged for $17 or so.-Each room has a little ledge to walk out on, railing in our room looked like it was ready to fall off. I jiggled it and it almost did!

But with that said, my stay was wonderful. Our family of 3 was at this hotel for 6 nights, while attending the Girls Junior Olympics Volleyball Championships. The hotel arranged a customized website for our group to book our hotel rooms. We were offered several benefits that eliminated some of the complaints of other reviewers. The hotel was easy to find, travelling from DFW. The hotels exterior was pleasant and the parking lot was large, clean and appeared as safe as possible. Plenty of lighting at night. It is conveniently located, just a short drive to downtown Dallas. Using either the freeway or Market Center Blvd to make your way to the city center. The front desk clerks were very pleasant and very helpful. I believe that the hotel should be done with the construction very soon. They were finishing construction on the area at the front of the restaurant and the workout room by the pool. I did not notice any construction on any of the floors that I visited. The hotels front desk area, elevators and hallways to our room were clean. Our room was fantastic. Probably one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. A large comfortable bed and the couches pull out bed was even comfortable. There was a large flat screen tv in each room. Both tvs worked great and were the best tvs I have ever had in any hotel room. The rest of the room was very nice and pleasant. The 6 nights we stayed there were great and our time spent in the room was comfortable. The main bedroom was a bit cramped with the door opening in towards the bedroom, but it is nothing you cant deal with. It was just a very nice, comfortable room for the 3 of us. We did have a room on the noisy side of the hotel, facing the freeway. But while travelling we all sleep using earplugs, so the freeway noise was not a problem. But I could see how that may affect many guests. The hotel supplied our group with a buffet breakfast each morning. The breakfast was delicous and very satisfying. We did not have the need to visit the hotels restaurant or bar. The workout room equiptment was very nice. The room itself was in the final stages or construction. The indoor/outdoor pool was nice, along with the indoor whirlpool. The hotels computer and printer was very helpful. I did not bring a laptop, as I certainly did not want to pay for internet service from my room. They really need to provide free wireless internet hookup. Our arranged group rate per night was very reasonable. I certainly can not complain about that. The hotel has a shuttle van available to its guests. I believe the van is available for locations within a couple of miles from the hotel. (3 miles perhaps?)

"hotel_197","hotel_4668","Ridiculous Hidden Charges for an OK place I recently stayed at this hotel while attending an event at the World Trade Center. This hotel is overpriced and over rated for the services and facilities rendered and should not be considered if you are traveling to attend any of the Dallas markets. If you want to overpay for a cramped bedroom chopped into a suite of 2 mini-rooms, pay $10/day for Internet access, pay $8/day to park in an open parking lot, (a charge not disclosed in the reservation process) pay for LOCAL telephone calls, and eat mediocre over-priced food, go for it. There are 10-15 other brand name hotels within a 3-mile radius that are better value for your hard-earned money. See my review of the nearby Holiday Inn Dallas Market Center.When I drove up to the hotel, I thought it was closed as it is under renovation. There was no front door staff or bellman on duty at the door, so I dragged my bag across the open parking lot myself. I stepped to the counter to check in, handed over my credit card and Starwood Preferred Guest card to one of the two employees. One was helping another guest try to locate a Federal Express package, and after beginning my registration, the person helping me stopped to assist her co-worker look for the Fed-x package, keeping me standing, watching, waiting while they fumbled around and didn鈥檛 find the package. My room was on the 11th floor, the SPG floor, but the lounge where I was looking forward to relaxing with complimentary evening appetizers and a glass of wine was closed for renovation. If it were my hotel, I would comp similar services somewhere in the hotel or provide an SPG coupon of some sort, but no such offer was made. My newly renovated room had a large sitting area with a granite topped bar, table desk, sofa and flat screen TV that was a total invasion of necessary space in the bedroom which was way too small for comfort. The bedroom was consumed by its king size bed that was so large that when the door between the bedroom and sitting room was open, you could not walk by the bed to the open closet area. A second flat screen TV was tucked in the corner, but it was somehow positioned requiring that you sit up and carefully point the remote at the exact perfect spot to change channels. The 2 TV鈥檚 were literally 1 foot apart, each on one side of the wall between the 2 rooms鈥omething so silly that could have been remedied by making the opening between the 2 rooms a niche where the TV could swivel and be viewed from either side. The division of the room into 2 rooms just made the whole thing seem cramped. Since there was no space in the bedroom to open your suitcase, so you actually had to use the sitting room as part of the 鈥減rivate鈥?space normally reserved for the bedroom of a suite. What was the idea of this design? Dinner in the hotel was another story. The menu is from the 80鈥檚, and so was the food preparation. I ordered what I thought was the healthiest meal, fettuccini with grilled shrimp, but it arrived swimming in oil. The servers were really friendly, but not trained to simply look at the table and determine what was needed, so I sat with an empty water glass and finished my meal without a coffee at the end as the server never offered either. I mentioned this on the comment card on my departure and was surprised that the Food Operations Manager immediately acknowledged my comments in an email.

I was in a renovated room, and they needed to start over. The bed was terrible, and probably 30 years old (Taco Bed). They charge $9 for parking, $10 for the internet, and $4.00 for bottled water. The Best thing in the Hotel was the hot Bar Tender. The exercise room was in an old guest room. You had to walk through the parking lot to get to the pool. The most exciting part of my stay was the women stuck in one of the elevators screaming for someone to let her out. After smiling a little bit and celebrating that it was not me in there I went back to my room. I was shocked to find the women still crying historically from the elevator nearly 45 minutes later when I went back down.

I've stayed here many times, and prefer this hotel due to it's convenient location with access to IH-35E, Market Center Blvd, Harry Hines, etc. The TV sets are OLD - the color is really bad on them. Even though I'm a Starwood Gold member, I got a hotel next to an elevator lobby, and had to listen to crowds come and go through the night. The hotel often hosts wedding parties and such on weekends. Renovation work generally kicks off at 9am, til 6 or 7pm and they were nice enough to book me on the 4th floor, while the 5th floor is being renovated. If you don't spend a lot of time in your room during the day, you won't be inconvenienced. For me, I had to spend a good amount of time trying to recover from a stomach ailment, and was able to get NO rest because of the hammering and drilling all day. Had I known this place was under renovation, I'd have gladly paid more to get any other hotel in the Market Center area, even the ghetto Raddisson. By the time you add $18 daily for internet and for parking, you're better off at someplace like Courtyard that has FREE internet. There's no desk - there's this round table from the 1970's (which was encrusted with some kind of food items until I cleaned it off) with two rickety chairs. I'd think a hotel like this would cater to business travellers and have a desk with a REAL office chair.","Apr 19, 2008","1","1",5,3,5,3,5,4,2,"3","$161"

There are somethings I didn't like, but basically it is an average 3 star hotel. It does need refurbishing; and this has already started. (I recently stayed at a brand new hotel and there are differences between brand new and needing refurbishing.) However, there wasn't anything unacceptable about my room. Housekeeping appears to be doing a good job. My room was clean. I didn't see any mold or mildew on the walls and the wall covering was intact.  Registration was professional and courteous. The public spaces are pleasant and inviting.To me, the biggest distraction was the carpet in the corridor. It was loose and wrinkled.

In the first room I was given, the lights didn't work, and I could see mold growing on the walls. The wallpaper was peeling and moldy from water damage. I asked to be moved, and I was moved to a room just as bad. The room smelled of mold, and you could see the mold growing near the windows. The curtains conveniently hid the mold. The vents all had mold growing out of them. There were stains all over the floor, and water damage everywhere. The couch and chairs were all stained as well. I bought Lysol and an air freshener at the store, but that did nothing to get rid of the smell. I was physically sick while staying here. 15 people left and went to another hotel, and it was the best move I've ever made. Towards the end of the training, the horror stories from the Sheraton Suites continued. People came in to training and their clothing smelled like mold. One person had mold growing on their clothes that they had put in their closet. A few people talked about ants in their room, and one person said they woke up with ants all over their body. I wouldn't wish this hotel on my worst enemy. Avoid this hotel at all costs!!!!!","Mar 13, 2008","1","1",2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"3","$161"
"hotel_197","hotel_8775","Needs a big renovation.. now! Good location since it's right off of I-35 and Market Ctr Blvd. Everything other than that seems to be below par for the Sheraton brand name.Rooms are all suites and very small. With the king size bed in the room, you can literally extend your arm and touch all 4 walls. The televisions don't seem to have been updated since 1980s. They are in working condition and that's just about it. The furniture in the room seems to be at least a decade old, if not more and it really shows with chips in the paint etc.The bathroom is equally old and the bath tubs have chips all over. The amenities weren't any known brand.The only saving grace is that the room and bathroom is kept relatively clean. There is Starbucks coffee in the room and a refrigerator with a mini bar. However, don't dare look around the fridge or under the sink.The fitness center on the ground level will remind you of Norman Bates Motel and has an extremely eerie feeling. The lighting is dim. The little equipment and weights there is - seem to be from the 1960s and very rusty/squeaky. The false ceiling is falling apart and with the pool right next to this fitness center, the dampness was very uncomfortable.The top two or three levels I think are club floors and if you are a an elite SPG member, do try to push the staff for an upgrade to that level. The small dining room on the top level has a small limited complimentary breakfast, but enough to get you full.The restaurant on the ground level is decent and has the regular buffet, lunch and dinner offerings.The staff at the hotel is courteous.Parking... this is another quirk. Why are they charging 7 bucks? This is not a downtown hotel and none of the adjoining hotels including Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Doubletree have parking fee. This hotel shares its parking lot with Courtyard. There is no additional security or restricted access to the parking, so I don't know why they should be charging a fee.A very disappointing hotel in the Starwood chain. If this were my first experience with Sheraton, I would never stay at another Sheraton again in my life. But I know that this hotel is an anomaly in the Starwood chain.","Feb 8, 2008","0","0",3,3,4,4,4,4,4,"3","$161"
"hotel_197","hotel_9535","Not a Bad Choice When in Dallas This is a rather nice hotel with a convenient location right off the highway. Dallas, as a city, is very spread out so there is really no hotel with a central location. Watch out for hotels that claim that!We arrived to found our room already assigned and were on our way very quickly. All rooms here are suites. We had a living room, bedroom and a large bathroom. There is also a kitchenette of sorts by the door with coffee maker and microwave. The living room also featured a large desk.Curiously, there are small balconies which can be reached by a sliding door by the bedroom. Two people can stand out there by why it was even included is a mystery. There is no room to sit and the only thing it appears handy for is smoking.Anyway, the room was well maintained and the bed very comfortable as always at a Sheraton. There was a small t.v. in the bedroom and a larger one in the living room. Curiously, they are positioned back to back to if you use the remote to change the channel, it will also change the channel of the other one! We got a good laugh out of that and whoever planned the rooms should be reassigned.There is a restaurant in the lobby but we never ate there. The exception being the bar which serves burgers, sandwiches and snacks. We had planned to eat at the lobby restaurant but, curiously, found it closed and it was a Saturday night. We didn鈥檛 feel like driving so we tried the bar. The food was actually very good and the prices not bad. For breakfast, there is a Denny鈥檚 a quick walk away. You鈥檒l find that much cheaper than at the hotel.The hotel is right on the highway making various points in Dallas easily reachable. The airport is about a 20 minute drive. Traffic can be very bad in Dallas so if you need to be somehwere, give yourself some exra time. However, other than the Denny鈥檚 and the lobby restaurant, there are no places to eat within walking distance. You鈥檒l need a car but a short drive will give you plenty of places to choose from. The lobby staff also made some great recommendations and are very helpful. You are also close to several malls as well.The hotel is in an office complex. It appears designed for business travelers as during our weekend stay, the place was quiet and seemed pretty empty.The housekeeping crew did a great job and the staff we encountered were very friendly and willing to assist. Overall, a nice stay and I would recommend this place.","Jan 30, 2008","0","0",5,5,5,5,5,5,4,"3","$161"
"hotel_197","hotel_2711","Not bad if you don't pay retail! If I were a guest of this hotel and paid $150.00 a night I would be pretty upset! The hotel looks good from the outside but show big signs of wear and tear on the inside. The first thing when arriving you are told it is $7.00 per night to park in the open parking lot. That is an extreme way to squeeze every dime out of someone. I was in room 215 and on arrival the smell of stale smoke in the room was extensive. There were beer cans in the trash can from the previous guest and the vacuum must have been broken that day because the floor was not clean. The plumber got the hot/cold water backwards on the bathroom sink so after waiting for some time for the hot water I realized it was backwards. The room was nice and big with two TV's. Unfortunately every picture on both televisions made the subjects look sunburned they were so red. And there was no remote for either set. Waking up early was not an option because of the rattling pipes that sounded like they ran between the box springs and matress. The wallpaper was coming off the wall but the heater darn sure worked! In the defense of the hotel, there was a letter on the elevator explaining renovations were about to begin. Would I stay there again? For 50 bucks a night I would, but for 150 a night they better throw in dancing girls and open bar! When staying at a hotel make certain the clock by the bed is set correctly and the alarm is not on to hurry you out the door in the morning. I have noticed this practice by hotel maids more and more in the last could of years.","Jan 10, 2008","1","1",4,3,6,2,6,6,1,"3","$161"
"hotel_197","hotel_8331","Barely tolerable for a business traveler at the holidays Based on shabby reviews I had seen of the Westin City Center hotel, I switched at the last minute to stay here, as it was well located and supposedly had amenities for Starwood Preferred Guest Gold members. Turned out the Club Floor was closed, and there were very few guests there at all. Other propeties clearly posted when they were closing amenities, but this hotel even had Club Floor rooms to reserve on the internet... at least I did not reserve one of them! Restaurant was closed, too, but a modest continental breakfast was offered.The hotel did extend a nice gesture to the guests by delivering a small Christmas package to the rooms with a nicely boxed corkscrew and bottle stopper..... Did they think about guests flying home and the corkscrew having a blade on it that made TSA confiscate it? No. Fortunately there was a not a line behind me in Security, but it was totally embarassing.Also, during my two-night stay I kept thinking that the living area had a lot of highway noise and was drafty. Turned out the windows did not shut and seal properly. This is something that housekeeping should have recognized--a supervisor inspecting rooms surely would have noticed the difference unless all of the windows are that delapidated.Oh, and there was also the dense cloud of marijuana smoke in the hall Christmas Eve between my room and the elevator coming from either a guest room or, more likely, the service bay. When I got to my destination a few blocks away, I realized that I had a serious buzz!","Dec 27, 2007","2","2",2,4,4,3,3,3,1,"3","$161"

Had a 2 bed suite that felt very cramped. Did not sleep nearly as well as I do at the Westin in downtown Dallas (which was sold out). Stiff couch and scratched up desk in living room .Outdated bathroom- moldy tub, poor lighting.(Mind you, this was all on a Starwoods Club Floor. I have platinum status, so I'm assuming I was put in one of the better rooms) Gym- Out of the four **old** machines there (two bikes, treadmill, and stair climber)- only one of the bikes worked properly (barely) Other machines did not 'turn on' at all, or seemed as if they were about to give out (treadmill made a horribly loud noise every time you took a step... not good) Weight machine was as old as the machines, and equally useless.If you have a choice of Starwoods hotels in Dallas, stick with the W or Westin.

"hotel_197","hotel_2136","Disgusting and dilapidated room I've had the displeasure of staying here twice within the past two months on priceline reservations. The rooms I was given were absolutey disgusting and dilapidated. The most disturbing was the huge amounts of mold packed into the air vents. I suspect this is why the wallpaper was buckling and peeling off the walls along with outlet covers and fixtures. The furniture and carpets were very soiled, worn and had burn holes in them. The bath had large places of missing caulk and mold in the shower. I made the mistake of visiting the pool area once. It was a mess. The pool was dirty, there was trash and bird crap everywhere and the pool lounge cushions were moldy. I wouldn't dare get into the pool and definitely not into the green water in the hot tub.I can not believe that Starwood allows this dump to operate as a Sheraton. In my opinion, the rooms are not up to standards of the sleaziest rent by hour motel. Starwood should do a massive room overhaul immediately or pull the Sheraton flag from this disgrace.","Aug 14, 2007","3","3",2,2,4,2,4,3,3,"3","$161"

"hotel_197","hotel_6387","Nice rooms, service has gone downhill (many stays here), and prices going up I've stayed at this hotel many times in the last year and a half. It started out excellent, but the service has gone downhill significantly, and my last stay was a nightmare. The prices have also gone way up in the last year (per online sites like Travelocity, Expedia, [-----]). Although I've had many excellent experiences here in the past, the last one was so bad I'll never stay here again.First, the good stuff. The room layout is just great. It's a two room suite with french doors between. There's a nice wet bar, the bathroom counter space is good, all the normal amenities (coffee maker, nice hair dryer, toiletries, etc) and the TV channel selection is nice (2 TVs), the shower is nice. The beds are nice -- comfortable, nice duvet covers on comforters, nice pillows, etc. A small fridge is in the room. They have a decent shuttle service during the day. And they do allow pets if you need to bring one along; they even have special doggy beds for them.The so-so stuff. The restaurant is average (or a bit below) and a bit pricey, although the staff is nice. The internet service is $10 per day, or you can use Wayport on a monthly charge. Wayport's service is spotty and the hotel is no help getting it fixed if you have a problem. They've started charging for parking in the adjacent lot unless you've got a corporate reservation or other special booking.The bad stuff. The hotel is next to a freeway and a good number of the rooms are very noisy. Since the hotel books many conventions and corporate accounts, you may not be able to switch rooms. (A solo traveler doesn't have a lot of sway here, since they have a number of big-time corporate clients, like Southwest Airlines.) The staff is mostly friendly and smiling (at least during the day), but not particularly helpful or reliable. If you need a special request, don't count on it being honored until you've asked several times. There's a big difference in the quality of staff in the morning, afternoon, and late night. The in room automated check out doesn't work at all (it has never worked the entire time I've stayed here). They've double charged my credit card on more than one occassion, although the bill did finally get corrected through the credit card company. Carts to get your luggage up are often MIA and so is the bellman. If you're an SPG member, be sure to check your point count, as it may or may not get credited for your stay. They give lousy directions to pretty much anywhere.My last stay was not a good experience, primarily because of hotel staff. I don't think I can post details without violating the posting rules, but I won't stay again.Staying here could be a very good experience or a very bad experience, depending on your room assignment and the staff you happen to find on duty. I've had both experiences in my many stays here.","Feb 17, 2006","7","7",4,5,1,5,1,3,1,"3","$161"

I was initially a little skeptical about staying in Brooklyn as I've been to New York before and have always stayed in hotels in Manhattan. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how close it really is. I'm a Londoner and am accustomed to getting on the underground to travel to places, so it really wasn't a big deal for me to get on a train to get to Manhattan. The location was amazing - it was just a few minutes away from over 6 different train lines which meant that you could get to anywhere in Manhattan with ease. The hotel itself was pleasant enough - good sized rooms, clean, helpful staff. The restaurant didn't look very good so I never ate there, but with Manhattan just a few minutes away, I don't really see the need to eat at a hotel restaurant. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay.

"hotel_199","hotel_6853","Add me to the list of those who love this hotel! We stayed at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott for one night before boarding a cruise out of Brooklyn. We booked directly through the Marriott's website many months before and secured a favorable rate using the Senior discount.Arrived around 3 PM and had no problem checking in early. The front desk staff were both professional and friendly. After check-in we moved to the bar for a couple of drinks and found this to be a fun place. The bartender, Michael, makes a great Manhattan!Talked with the doorman, Nick, who recommended a great dinner spot - the Queen Italian Restuarant. There was 6 of us and he had no problem arranging transportation for our ride there.After dinner we returned to the Marriott for coffee and dessert. They serve Starbucks and a wicked cheesecake sampler platter ($13) which easily fed us all - we may not have finished it all! Great attentive service as well.The rooms were clean and comfortable and good sized. The bed was very comfy. Very large bathroom and lots of hot water and pressure in the morning.The hotel itself is very lovely. There are escalators from the main entrance up to the lobby and they are surrounded by lots of greenery and flowers. Security is also very evident and appreciated.We enjoyed a great breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant. A buffet is offered in addition to the regular menu. Portions were huge and I'm not sure any of us were able to finish. Service was extremely friendly but a little slow.As this was a quick trip we were not able to enjoy the pool - hopefully we will on our next trip, as we are staying here again next May.To sum it up we had a great stay and look forward to the next one!Transportation notes: there were 4 of us traveling from JFK with at least 8 bags. We arranged to have Arecibo pick us up - the fee to the hotel was $50 plus tip. Our doorman, Nick, arranged our transportation to the port and that was $25 plus tip.","Nov 14, 2008","5","5",6,6,4,6,6,6,1,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_9872","Scenic Views, Beautiful Neighborhood, Great Service We just returned from a long weekend trip to New York City. We have stayed at this hotel several times this year and always received the same terrific service. The rooms are very comfortable and most often we have been given rooms with a great view of the city and concierge level access. All of the staff with whom we interacted- the doormen, the check-in staff, the concierge, the parking attendants, the fitness room attendant are friendly, courteous and helpful. On a recent stay when we checked in early we were put in a room we didn't care for. When we asked for a room change for the next day, we were immediately moved. This was all done quickly and pleasantly, with no hesitation.A full breakfast is available in the concierge room on weekdays. It offers more than just the usual continental breakfast fare, along with outdoor balconies offering tremendous views of Manhattan. The staff are welcoming and friendly to all. The late afternoon snacks and evening desserts are especially tasty.Finally another bonus when staying at this hotel is the charming Brooklyn neighborhood of brownstones and the Promenade which is a short walk from the hotel. It has a breathtaking view of the city at night and lovely shops and restaurants nearby.After a quick cab ride into Manhattan for an evening of dining , shopping or theater , you return to a quiet retreat away from the bustle and crowds of the city . We continue to enjoy our stays here.","Nov 13, 2008","3","3",6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$457"

The hotel itself is fantastic, the staff are friendly, the rooms are huge and clean with a nice bar\restaurant to relax in.

Overall a great hotel, well maintained and very clean (especially when compared to previous experiences in 'upscale' Manhattan hotels).Food was very good, and restaurant/bar staff friendly.My only issue was with the noise from the adjacent room that came through the connecting door. This seems to be a common problem with Marriotts, in my experience (maybe with all hotels as well, but I stay almost exclusively at Marriotts.)

Every request, question, or activity was handled superbly with smile. The end result was a perfect stay and wedding. We couldn't be more satisfied.The hotel is a very modern facility, with excellent location in downtown Brooklyn, close to the subway, and within walking distance to Manhattan, yet priced lower then Manhattan hotels.

"hotel_199","hotel_8259","Nice rooms, weak service I was impressed with my guest room. It was up to date, clean and very comfortable. The room was top notch. But while my room had a nice flat screen TV it wasn't worth much without a good signal. I called the desk and they said the problem was due to the weather conditions. I found out later after visiting a relative's room that their TV was working just fine.My issues with service started when I pulled up to the hotel driveway. I had two parties in my car and all of the luggage was taken to one room even though I explained to the bellman that we had two separate reservations. We gave him both of our names. I had to go to the north building to retrieve my luggage and bring it to my room in the south building.I asked the bellman what I needed to do to park my car. He said to pull into the garage and follow the sign for hotel guests. The attendant inside just pointed me down to the lower level. I've never seen a more confusing hotel garage. Everything was roped off and I couldn't find any anyone until I got to the bottom level. I was eventually able to park but when I checked in I told the desk person that I had a parking ticket. Either she didn't understand me or she was insulted that I didn't let her finish her spiel but I had to ask again at check out for them to put the parking on my bill so I would be able to leave the garage. When I tried to leave the garage the parking attendents weren't sure what to do to get me out of the garage. It took them three tries to get the gate opened for me. I really wanted to like this hotel because the rooms were nice. But the service was weak and I expected much more for the money I paid.","Sep 29, 2008","0","0",3,6,5,6,2,2,1,"4","$457"

The hotel is very nice, and the rooms were great. The bedding was high quality and the toiletries and toilet paper were as well. The service was very friendly and responsive, and the Sunday brunch was delicious. The price was comparable to a Manhattan hotel, and the hotel on a rather busy downtown Brooklyn street. I lived in Brooklyn for four years, so I'm very much pro-Brooklyn, but if you had business in Manhattan this hotel would be rather inconvenient. Cabs were plentiful at the hotel, and there is a subway nearby, but you have to walk a bit to get to any of the quaint Brooklyn Heights shopping and restaurants.

"hotel_199","hotel_6413","Great Marriott Hotel for Business Travelers I ended up staying at the Marriott at Brooklyn Bridge this Past May. It was my third stay there in the past year. It is my favorite Marriott of the four in the area (others being Marquis in Time Square, Financial District near Wall St. and East Side). As a business traveler, I find the Marquis too crowded outside with tourist and the elevators take forever, East Side location is okay, rooms are small and a bit outdated (however that my have changed with recent renovations), and really don't care for Financial District Marriott for various reasons.Pros: Easy access to subway (2,3,4,5,M,R trains at Borough Hall a couple minutes walk; A,C,F at Jay Station across street in back of hotel. Great staff, friendly, never had any problems at all in my three stays. nice clean rooms, especially if you get a room in the expansion tower, Flat screen TV's with HD Channels. Huge Fitness area. My only gripe is the Health Club is not Marriott owned, and it closes at 10pm (I believe...maybe 11pm). Usually the Fitness Centers at most Marriotts are open 24/7. Side note: there also was construction going on one of the lower floors during the day (9am - 5pm only). It really have no affect on me since I was not there while it was going on. So if you are going to be staying in your room all day while you are in NYC, then yes, it may be an inconvienance. It may be over with by now.The concierge lounge, if you have access, is one of the nicer Marriott lounges. Free Wi-Fi access there, complimentary continental breakfast (fruit, cereal, eggs, pastries, yogurt, juices, bagels), complimentay soda (pepsi, diet pepsi, sierra mist, schwepps), water through out the day, complimentary Hors d'oeuvres in the evening and dessert (cookies, ice cream selection of cakes and pies). Honor Bar too for drinks in evening(think $5 for a drink, but may be wrong as I did not drink there).As far as internet goes, if $12.95 a night is too much you (it is for me), i signed up at boingo.com, which allows access at most Marriott hotels. It cost $21.95 a month (usually can signup at a reduced rate, like first two months for the price of one), works at a good amount of airports too...good deal compared to the alternative. It is worth while for me as I usually travel a week a month.I don't bother eating at Marriott's (unless I have a 2 for 1 dinner coupon). You are in NYC...besides of the convenience at eating there, you are only a quick subway to Chinatown/Little Italy and isn't too hard find a cheaper meal there. And i am sure the concierge at the front desk can direct you to a good restaurant too.","Aug 20, 2008","0","0",4,6,6,6,6,6,6,"4","$457"

I've never actually been yelled at by a manger before (or any staff member, for that matter), until I stayed here. I never once raised my voice, but she felt it was appropriate to tell me to be quiet so I could listen to what she was saying.I had billing issues, was awoken at 7:30-8:30 every morning by construction, didn't have my room cleaned every day, was lied to more than once by different staff members, and the list goes on and on.The location was good. Even though it was in Brooklyn it just took a few minutes on the subway to get to Manhattan. But that can't save it from the rudest staff as a whole I have ever encountered.They try to suck every penny out of you that they can, too. No packaged pasteries, even, for breakfast. Instead you can order their $19 (not kidding) bagel. Internet is $14 a day after tax. They charge for everything they can.I've had better customer service at Motel 6 and European youth hostels.

"hotel_199","hotel_3511","Hey, Hyatt? Hilton? Come to Downtown Bklyn. Marriott Needs Competition I'll start by saying this is a nice, clean, comfortable hotel. You can't go wrong staying here. But I have a real problem with a hotel that gets stingy with its guests. Especially at $429 -- before taxes - a night. Remember, we're still in Brooklyn.That $429 will buy you a comfortable room and nothing more. You will pay for internet access.... why? Because they can charge it. In the Manhattan hotels I've stayed at, that access is free if you go to their business center. Not at the Bklyn Marriott. AND you will pay for breakfast. You will pay through the nose if you want that breakfast brought to your room. Consider this: After all the fees were added, including the 20% service charge ON TOP OF the $4.00 delivery charge, a $16 breakfast brought to the room (danish and coffeee) cost $26.60. Don't count on the service for that money, either. On two of the four nights we were there we needed to contact the front desk. There was no answer, and a trip downstairs revealed that the staff was overwhelmed with airline staff checking in (or out). A lot of flight attendants and pilots seem to stay there, but the staff appears to have trouble handling them all. We came home one night to find the down escalator operating, while the up escalator was out of service. With a maintenance key and simple press of a button, the down escalator could have been switched to carry guests up. But the staff didn't seem to care.I know NYC hotel prices are outrageous, especially in the summer, but if the Brooklyn Marriott had a little competition from other hotels, instead of being the only show in lower Brooklyn, I think they'd have to be kinder to their guests for that money. Until they are, I will try to avoid it whenver I can.","Jul 16, 2008","1","1",2,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$457"

Mathilde is the woman from houskeeping who brings the mints for your pillow. One evening as we chatted she was telling me about a medication that she was taking, but could not remember the name. the next evening along with the mint on my pillow, was a nice note in which she shared the information.

"hotel_199","hotel_9926","Okay, and debate if a Super 8 would have been just as good The main issue with this hotel is its overpriced even at a group discount rate, but that seems to be the norm with any hotel in a big city. For the price I would have liked a cleaner room. The main part was clean but the bathroom was a tad gross with makeup and I dont know what else wiped all over the door and the tile had dirt, grime and bacteria in several spots. Not to mention left over garbage from the prior guest still on the floor. The good things about this hotel is it has a large work out room and the staff was very friendly. Montague street is only a 5 min. walk and it has all kinds of restaurants on it. Select carefully where you eat though as there are several dirty dining places on this street. And unfortunately the Thai place I went to was shut down the next day by NYC health department. There is a great healthy market you can by all your meals at which I recommend. I also recommend taking the walk all the way down to the end of this street where you will see a view of the statue of liberty and the city.

"hotel_199","hotel_3725","it was just fine. I stayed here for a girls' getaway weekend at the beginning of Sept. 2007. I'll be upfront and add that my friend used her Marriott points for our stay (and she still has about 90,000 left--THAT'S some business traveling).We arrived on a Thursday evening after a full work day and a 2 hour flight. But it's NYC, so when you get there, you have to take the bus to Manhattan, which drops you off around Times Square. But oh ha! We were staying in Brooklyn. We were told by someone--I think at this Marriott, but I'm not 100% sure on that--that we could get a taxi from Times Square to the Brooklyn Marriott for about $60. But oh ha again! As luck would have it, all the NYC taxi drivers were on strike, and so they were just charging whatever they felt like it that night. The first one we talked to wanted $70...per freaking person. This amused me to no end, because hello! It's New York, New York, where everything costs double, just like the name implies. My friend--a South African/British citizen just now getting accustomed to the ways and means of capitalist-no socialized healthcare-no free anything America--was aghast, but thankfully good at reading subway maps and somehow we got to where we were going via subway/bus. If she had written this review, the title would be That's Extortion! because she said this about every 10 minutes of our weekend stay.So. We got to the Marriott very, very tired. The front desk people were actually very nice--with a little nice, friendly chit chat (you angry reviewers who didn't get your rooms with the good views/good front desk service DO know that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, yes?) we were given a room on a floor way high up...maybe in the 20's? I don't remember. AND we had a spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge, which is beautiful at night when all lit up. Yet in a sadly, wistful, haunting kind of way, because of the spotlights that shine in memory of the World Trade Center.We used their gym once--she used the pool, I used a treadmill. No complaints here...to me, who is NOT a gym rat, a gym is a gym is a gym. And because of her chi chi high powered Marriott standing, she had access to their swanky business center that's on a floor which is off limits to the little people. But I did get to partake in their breakfast buffet backhandedly since she brought me down stuff--it looked like a good spread: eggs, bacon, fruit, yogurt, muffins. It does help to be nice to hotel employees AND have a frequent Marriott guest hook up. We were supposed to have a free welcome bucket of ice cream as part of the deal, but we got there so late the kitchen had closed. So they brought it the next day...while we were out getting blisters walking around Manhattan. Thus, it was melted by the time we got to it. But you know--they'd given us a room with a swank view and we didn't need the extra calories, so it was all good.Other than the great view, my favorite part of this room were the blackout curtains. Oh. My. God. Who invented these? Give that person a Nobel Peace Prize. After an exhausting afternoon/evening/night of travel, the next day I woke up and had no idea what time it was, but it didn't matter! I'd had the best sleep of my life. We had good, comfortable beds with good, comfortable pillows. The bathroom was decent, nice, and clean. I really don't know what some other reviewers' issues were with the toilet paper...is there a special standard for that stuff I don't know about? I don't know; I usually don't compare things like that, it seems a little, well, quite frankly, overly absorbed with certain bodily functions that make me start wanting to haul out my Freud reference materials.We never ate at the restaurant here--did they have one? We were too busy walking around the city. My friend is in love with rugby (or, conversely, just rugby players), so while I slept in the pitch black, heavenly room, she headed out early a lot to go figure out where we could catch some of those games and the front desk guy was always really sweet about waiting until at least 11 AM before calling the room to let me know she hadn't been kidnapped or mugged. They were also really helpful to us in printing out our boarding passes--somebody else here said they got charged for that, but we didn't.I've stayed in one other place in NYC--quite some time ago, so I forget the name of the place--and I have to say this is a very nice hotel. If you're a hotel snob, then maybe not for you...go check into the Four Seasons. But if you're an avid business traveller racking up the Marriott points (and/or a friend leeching off an avid business traveller), or you've got the extra money to spend on a really, really nice hotel in the NYC/Manhattan area, then I think you'll be just fine with this place.Tips (and this is for anywhere in the world you go, not just here):Bring your happy face and good attitude, and I bet you'll find that 9 out of 10 people in an establishment will be more than willing to try to accommodate your needs.Some things are worth getting snippy about, like a broken lock on a door...or a room teeming with cockroaches...or smelly souls loitering in the lobby and hallway areas. But toilet paper? Unless you have serious, bleeding hemorrhoids, I'd let that one go. Ditto for the pool temperature...it's a pool, not a bathtub. And there were some other nitpicky things I got a kick out of reading, but then I'm starting to nitpick on the nitpickers, and that's not cool I suppose.It's NYC. Bring good walking shoes. And dooooon't eat in Little Italy. They have really scary waiters that make single traveling women totally uncomfortable. Long story--but trust me on it.","May 18, 2008","4","3",5,6,6,6,6,5,5,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_7301","Good service The Marriott was the chosen location for an international conference I was attending. It's an odd location, and feels very different to other parts of NYC. It's about a 20 min walk from the hotel to the start of the business/shopping district at the Manhattan side of the bridge, and around a $7 ride. We also travelled up-town to meet friends at the Plaza in the Park, which cost $20. Meanwhile a tube (subway) journey to Greenwich village took 20 mins and cost $4 rtn.Don't be fooled by the shopping in the area. The fact it has a Macy' around the corner, doesn't make this a smart part of town. That said, head up Montagu St (5 min walk) and you do find a few quieter streets, with older buildings with more character. There are some good restaurants up there too. At the end of the road are the Brooklyn Heights that overlook the river, bridge and the South/Eastern side of Manhattan island.As for the hotel itself, all staff were polite and very helpful. The rooms were large, smart, modern and clean.We only had conference food in the hotel, so I can't comment on overall food quality. They have an in-house Starbucks, but there are plenty of places within a 3 minute radius serving coffee/juices etc.There is a pool and gym - which looked enticing, but I didn't make it in there.","May 14, 2008","0","0",4,6,3,5,6,5,5,"4","$457"

"hotel_199","hotel_1780","We enjoyed our stay immensely We tried something different for our latest Manhattan Trip. We stayed in Brooklyn and took the subway into Manhattan. We saved over 100 bucks a day on the room by staying at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott. The hotel is located near the subway (about 1 block). We were a little intimidated by the New York subway system at first, but soon felt comfortable taking it to the various sites we visited in Manhattan. Hopstop.com is a very useful website for navigating the subway. It gives very detailed directions for navigating between locations. WWW.MTA.INFO is another resource that can be used. The hotel is also a stop on the Grayline Tours loops. For around $40.00 you can get a 48 hr pass that will give you hop on/hop off access to the dozens of attractions on or near the tour bus/trolley stops that are on Grayline's routes. The hotel room was large and clean. I did scare myself a few times because of the placement of the mirrors in the room. I kept thinking a big ugly guy had made his way into the room until I got used to it. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. My daughter was especially impressed by the flat planel TV. The hotel restaurant was kind of pricy so we ate out. I purchased 48 hour New York Passes for each of us which gave us access to a pile of Manhattan attractions without having to wait in long lines. We were able to see many more things with the time we saved. All in all we loved the experience, but if you're going to be visiting spots mainly in Manhattan as we do, you might want to opt for the conveniece of staying at one of the Manhattan hotels.","May 4, 2008","2","2",5,5,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_9574","Fantastic! Our son chose this hotel for the out of town guests traveling to his wedding in Brooklyn. The guests occupied a total of 12 rooms. He could not have made a better choice for us! Everyone was thoroughly pleased with their accommodations. The rooms are extremely spacious, well appointed, and very clean. The beds, bed linens and pillows were so comfortable. It was great having a small sitting area with couch (which also opened up to a full size bed), wide screen tv, safe, small refrigerator, and coffee maker in the room. We were too busy to use the pool or fitness room, but several family members did and really enjoyed themselves. Both check-in and out went extremely fast and everyone at the front desk was extremely gracious and accommodating. In fact, everyone working at the hotel went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Parking was simple and convenient, and we really appreciated not having to pay a fee every time we took the car in and out of the garage. Many of the guests took themselves on a walking tour of the neighborhood, over the Brooklyn Bridge, and to the wedding which was held at the nearby Brooklyn Historical Society. They all remarked at what a beautiful, safe area it was. The food at the hotel restaurant for lunch and breakfast was delicious and very reasonably priced. There were no complaints from any of the folks that traveled with us about anything! Now that we have found this beautiful gem of a place in Brooklyn, we will definitely stay here when visiting the city as it is an easy subway ride away from the bright lights and big city!","Apr 29, 2008","0","0",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$457"

Customer service was very polite and helpful, giving us a nice sushi restaurant recommendation that was about 7 min walk from the hotel.Room was very nice, and updated.

"hotel_199","hotel_1051","Best in the Borough! Stayed three nights in Apr 08 in the North tower. This hotel is a great way to explore Brooklyn. Very convenient to subway stops and just around the corner from the Jay St (A line) stop. Room itself was great with lots of space and great amenities including a small refrigerator and coffee maker. I don't use internet while on vacation so can't comment on that. The room was newly renovated and very nice. The large HD TV was great! Bed was very comfortable and fresh, clean white linens made it even more inviting after a long day of sightseeing. Bathroom was spacious and plenty of counter space for toiletries. Hotel provided a hair dryer in the room. Room had a large closet, too. Pool and gym were welcome features. The pool was a bit chilly but not unbearable. Nice enough for a few laps to loosen up. Hot tub was kind of small but served its purpose. Sauna was good size. Lots of gym equipment and not many people using it over weekend. Only thing I would change is pool hours; they close at 7 p.m. on weekends. Did not eat a meal in the Archives restaurant but the bar area is a nice place for a quick snack - including Junior's cheescake if you are so inclined. Also be sure to check out the historic artifacts they have in the display cabinets - some FREE interesting Brooklyn history right there in the hotel and courtesy of the Brooklyn Historical Society! Slight downsides to the hotel: some of the rooms are quite a way from the elevator since there is only one bank of elevators. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and did a great job. One day they were literally on the floor cleaning for 12 hours; from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m. I did think that was a little bit late to be cleaning, including the accompanying noise. Otherwise, the hotel was quiet and peaceful at night. The front desk staff were proficient, although a bit rushed. Understandable due to the traffic at the desk at times. Concierge was helpful and friendly. Doormen tried to sell the services of a towncar versus a cab, but the cabs were available so used one of them to get to the Williamsburg area. About a $12 cost. It's a very easy walk (apx. 2 blocks) to the Brooklyn Bridge walkway entrance. Out the front door and turn right. There is a restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner right at the corner where you enter walkway, which is convenient if you want a meal on the way there or back. All in all, a great stay and I would definitely stay at the Marriott again! GO SEE BROOKLYN it's a wonderful alternative to Manhattan!","Apr 8, 2008","1","1",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$457"

"hotel_199","hotel_8718","The Marriott Is Good Alternative Booked a Last-Minute Deal through Travelocity for quick single person weekend trip before Spring/Summer prices go up and New York gets too crowded and hot. Options for relatively inexpensive hotels were limited, but chose the Marriott based on total price for air and hotel ($554 total including taxes/fees). Thought that was pretty good deal for 2 nights and flight from Greensboro, NC (we have lousy connections and EXPENSIVE flights from our airport). Just wanted an adventure out of town and to see some shows before work gets busy. Tried the cheap inbound trip on the M60 bus from La Guardia to Lexington Ave., then subway (4 or 5) directly to Burrough Hall stop (a five minute or less walk to hotel). This took about 1.5 hours from airport to hotel, but cost 2.00). Hotel in safe area, well lit, lots of traffic. Hotel is very pleasant and easy to find on Adams Street (main drag). Checked in at noon, no problem; got king-size bed, but no view on 4th floor of older building because none available at that hour; receptionist was very nice and I appreciated the early check-in; I suspect I could have checked in earlier or gotten a better view if had checked in later. The pool/exercise center is terrific; clean, new equipment, not crowded when I was there, and the hot tub was great after early morning travel. Towels provided at the pool. Nice clean locker room. Room was large by NY standards (15 X15 at least), floor to ceiling windows overlooking street (good curtains, shears, and light-blocking curtains), not noisy at all; large/clean bathroom with combo shower/tub; lots of towels; room seemed new and fresh; nothing fancy, but very attractive and comfortable!!! Could have just hung out in the room. Coffee maker but no robes or mini-bar; did have mini-fridge which was nice touch. Bed and linens/pillows all super comfortable. Flat screen TV nice. Hallway noise non-existent. Bar food at midnight on Friday night was a first-rate burger and fries for $14. Bar was pleasant, not crowded or loud. The bridge itself is about a 15 minute quick walk; takes about 30 minutes quick pace to cross to Manhattan at court house from the hotel entrance; pleasant safe walk. Manhattan Bridge walkway also close by if going directly to Chinatown, but not as pleasant a walk because of trains (my opinion); also, not many people, so a little spooky. Chinatown is a 45 minute quick walk from hotel across bridge; West Village about an hour or so. nice part of town to walk in. Subway stops are all convenient; travel time from Burrough Hall stop to 42nd Street on #4 train about 20-30 minutes or less; or take downtown train (#4,5,6) to Brooklyn Bridge stop and walk back over the Bridge; excellent sights. World Trade Center about a 30 minute walk from hotel. Let me check bags for Sunday afternoon stroll about town. Lincoln Towncar to La Guardia $30 flat rate; nice trip on Sunday afternoon, about 15 minutes from hotel, though it can be much longer depending on traffic. For the price, this was a good choice for me, nice place to hang out and return to late in the evening or early morning. Explored Brooklyn Heights which is just southwest of the hotel; ate at Pete's Downtown with view of East River and skyline; good reasonable Italian for about half of Manhattan prices (at foot of Fulton Landing right under the bridge and nextdoor to DUMBO; River Cafe is right across the street. Brooklyn Promenade is worth the walk. This area is pretty historic with some old houses and Washington headquarters in 1776; pretty charming. All in all, very much enjoyed this hotel and Brooklyn (and the price, which was something like $190/night). I would prefer this hotel to Times Square (for sure) or Midtown (maybe) if the price was right because it was quiet and convenient.","Mar 17, 2008","1","1",5,6,5,6,5,5,1,"4","$457"

"hotel_199","hotel_9982","Service standards need urgent attention!! My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of February as part of our 50th wedding anniversary celebrations. How fortunate that we were due to cruise on Queen Mary 2 for the next 10 nights; and what a contrast in the standards of service!! Only one clerk on duty at reception in a 667 room hotel! A request for a possible upgrade was met with a brusque negative. The hotel had been informed in advance of the occasion but we were given a very basic room about as far from an elevator as you could get. No account was taken of my wife's mobility problemsand a promised room change never materialised. The room keys we were given didn't work so we stood in the corridor waiting for assistance. Reception would send someone up straightaway but 15 minutes later no-one had arrived. A bell boy eventually arrived with our luggage and used his master key to let us in; but we still did not have any keys for the room.The information folder said that breakfast was available in the restaurant until 11.30 am. Going down at 10.15 we were told that the buffet would close at 10.30 and we had better hurry. Sure enough the shutters on the buffet were brought down prematurely at 10.27 and the waiting staff couldn't get us out of the place quickly enough in order to set the tables for lunch. A very bad impression and very misleading information in the room.On the next two mornings we breakfasted at a nearby diner where the food and service were superior and at about 1/3rd of the price.The rooms are larger than average for New York and the location is good with easy access to the lovely Brooklyn waterfront and good subway connections to Manhattan. It is also a short taxi ride to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. But the management of the hotel needs to get its act together.We have stayed in at least a dozen other Marriotts in USA from San Diego to Las Vegas and this was our worst experience by far.","Mar 14, 2008","2","2",4,3,5,5,2,2,1,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_10146","Good location in the Brooklyn area I stayed here for two nights in February-March 2008, and enjoyed my stay very much. I hope to have many more stays here in the years to come.Positives:鈥?The hotel is well-located in Brooklyn, near the Brooklyn Bridge, the promenade, subway stations, and many excellent and not-too-expensive restaurants.鈥?Some of the rooms (not mine, alas, but a friend鈥檚 that I was traveling with) have excellent view of the Manhattan skyline, the East River, and the Brooklyn bridge. (He had a 20th-floor room in the south tower; I had a 10th-floor room with a limited view.)鈥?The room was kept very clean, and the maid service was friendly and prompt (sometimes even before I was ready, which is unusual for me!).鈥?The staff were friendly and helpful, and wished me luck at the competition I was here to attend. :-)鈥?I liked the airport checkin terminal at the front desk, where you can print out boarding passes for your flight. This worked great.鈥?I liked the bathroom amenities, too, a nice orange-ginger set of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion (I think it was Bath and Body Works).鈥?If you need your Starbucks fix, there are two within a block or so of the hotel.鈥?The hotel has a car service, which I used to get back to LaGuardia 鈥?it has a flat rate and is a little more expensive than a taxi would be, but I loved the ease and comfort of the quiet, clean car, and would happily use the service again. You can, of course, also get a regular taxi, of which there are plenty.鈥?Although Adams Street, on which the hotel faces, is a large street that鈥檚 very busy during the day, it quiets down considerably at night (almost spookily so), and I didn鈥檛 hear any street noise in my room.鈥?The water pressure and temperature in the shower were good, and the bed was comfortable.鈥?I was here for an event being held in the hotel, but I could see using this hotel as a base to explore Manhattan, too 鈥?you can walk across the bridge, or, there are subway stops for several different lines within a block of the hotel. I trundled my relatively large bag from my Midtown Manhattan hotel to this hotel using the subway, with no difficulty at all.Negatives/other factors鈥?I didn鈥檛 like the shower head 鈥?it was very adjustable, with all sorts of options for mist, pulsing jets, etc., but somehow I couldn鈥檛 get it to just spew out a bunch of water. :-)鈥?Next time I would ask for one of the rooms with a better view. (My friend checked in after me and joined the Marriott frequent stay program right before he booked his room, whereas I鈥檝e been a member much longer, yet he got the better room 鈥?grr!)鈥?The lobby could use a few more places to congregate. You go up an escalator to the 2nd floor, where registration is, and although there are a few chairs there, there weren鈥檛 quite enough.鈥?A lot of the hotel shut down at odd times, including the foyer outside the ballroom area. I can understand locking the ballroom itself, but the foyer held extra chairs, restrooms, etc., and I couldn鈥檛 see any reason why it couldn鈥檛 have been kept open around the clock.鈥?I could not get my alarm clock to change the hour. (The rest of it seemed to work fine.)鈥?I didn鈥檛 eat at the hotel restaurant so can鈥檛 comment on that.In summary, the event I attended is likely to be held at this hotel for years to come, and I look forward to returning to the hotel every year for it. It was an excellent choice by the event organizers that otherwise I would never have known about.","Mar 14, 2008","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$457"

Even we were charged for an extension cord plus tax on the cord! If you want internet hook-up, they change a large amount for each day and each computer -- more than the room rate. We did get a discount for rooms but the hotel made up for this situation by taxing and charging us $80 dollars for coffee - 1 gal. They think that people will just accept the high prices because this is New York City. It is not! Brooklyn is locate across the river. Watch the contract! We could not bring in food! If you want to save some money, go somewhere else. This hotel is out to make money at the customer's expense. It is NOT worth it. We will not go again.

There is underground parking at a very reasonable price (we paid only $18). Our room was spacious and had a view of the courthouse and the river. The bed was very comfortable and there was also a comfy chaise as extra seating near the window. The decor was modern and trendy. I really like the touch of the ipod docking station alarm clock too! The bathroom was roomy and nicely decorated. Good toiletries too (orange spice from bath and body works), gave it a spa feel. There was a coffeemaker and fridge in the room. The room and hallways were all very clean. Noise was not a problem even though it is a large hotel.The hotel is in a great, convenient location. It is close to a variety of subway stops. We had no problem grabbing a cab/car with the assistance of the hotel. We hardly waited at all on a Saturday night. Tons of shops and restaurants nearby...everything from drugstores to clothing stores. I checked out the pool/ftiness room. Very large fitness room with good selection of cardio and weights. Also a lap pool, which looked nice, but it was packed so i decided against trying to get in. Both are accessible via a bridge connecting the two towers of the building so you don't need to go through the lobby in your bathing suit or gym clothes, which is nice.

Mom is very heavy and uses an extra wide w/c.We were offered the senior citizen rate of $169 per night for both rooms. The h/c room, reserved at the last minute only had a king...I could have gotten a roll away (which I actually saw and for a change it looked quite comfortable) but got an adjoining room for myself and Mom's aide. Each room had a small fridge but no microwave. The shower in Mom's room was great, a large fold down seat and sturdy bars...Rooms were spectacularly clean with luxury bedding and more pillows than I'd ever seen! The staff were not only professional but warm, helpful and friendly. All set up for business with plenty of plugs and internet access.I made it to Broadway in 20 minutes on an express train on Saturday morning! I's only two stops until you reach Manhattan! There were two different lines quite close to the hotel; the A C and the 1 2 3....about 35 minutes to the Museum of Natural History. The area around the hotel seemed quite safe, I went to a drug store at 2 am for some necessary items. My past experience in Manhattan was that there was a lot of hustle and bustle at the hotels and the rooms were tiny, lobbies almost non existent in some. I think it's a wonderful value to have so much space both in the room and nice places in the lobby to relax and be so close to everything. I went to college nearby at LIU about 20 years ago and the area has certainly changed for the better!When I stayed in NJ just walking distance to the bridge if I took a cab it was $18 just to get over the bridge! I took a cab from the Upper West Side back to the door of my hotel for $22...no fees for going over the bridge.The restaurant was pricey but nice fresh eggs and smoked salmon for breakfast ...Junior's Cheesecake was close by!The only problems were with the garage...the elevator near the h/c parking spaces sis not operate on the week ends but we didn't find that out till we were actually inside calling for assistance! The desk clerk was very sympathetic to our complaint, comped us all breakfast and promised to look into it. The next day we found after pulling up to a particular exit from the garage that the cashier did not have the equipment to process our parking ticket. Two other cars had to back out so that I could do a five point turn with the mini van and go to the Adams Street exit. The hotel manager promised to review the situation and I trust that he will.

"hotel_199","hotel_5649","Clean and friendly, but... I stayed at this hotel for two nights from Dec, 31st 2007 until Jan, 2nd 2008.The hall was really nice and there was a nice smell all the time- like some sort of candle or something.Check in was easy and quick. They gave me two queen size beds although a king size was guaranteed- but I didn't really care about that. (just an observation).One thing I found a bit strange is, that they wanted to look into my bag before they would let me check-in.. Probably that was because of New Year's Eve?!The room was clean and spacious, but: my room was on the ninth floor and facing a big street and hence pretty loud. I could also hear people talking in the room next to me. I went to the reception and they gave me a room on the 22nd floor which was quiet, but the fan in the bathroom was running and couldn't be switched off, so I decided to stay in my room on the 9th floor, although they told me that I could change rooms the next morning, because they were 'kind of' sold out. I decided not to change rooms, because actually I was too lazy and I was there for only two nights. After the second night I woke up at about 8.30 a.m. hearing doors slamming, people talking and AGAIN the noises from the street. Another thing I have to mention (someone mentioned it before as well): the pillows: they weren't very comportable... they were to high and at some point I just slept on the mattress without a pillow. The mattress was- unfortunately- not as comfortable as it should be... I am very thin, but when I got up in the morning you could see where exactly I was lying and I guess you can imagine that it wasn't very comfortable during the night either.I was surprised that they don't offer free internet. You obviously have to pay for the internet in the room, you also had to pay, I think, $3 or 5 to use the internet in the Business Lounge for 15 minutes. There are just 3 computers in there and it was occupied everytime I went by. I guess for $199 and more per night I can assume that there is free internet available. But the good points: the hotel was just one block away from some subway stations and with an express train it just takes about 5 minutes to Wall Street- Financial disctrict- and 15 minutes to midtown- Times Square.Everybody in the hotel was very nice and tried to help as much as possible. About 2 minutes awaw from the hotel you have a Burger King and a Wendy's and about 5 minutes there is a drug store.Unfortunately I had no chance to get that great look over Manhattan. They tell you on the homepage that you have a great view from the Concierge Lounge, but the Concierge Lounge is only for (as far as I remember) for platinum marriott members. Instead I walked to the Brooklyn Bridge and to Manhattan- which just takes about 25 Minutes- if you aren't taking pictures like crazy like I was ; )To sum it up: the location was good, the room clean, spacious and the staff was friendly and helpful. If you are more or less just sleeping there and sleeping not longer than 8.am or 8.30 am and have a deep slepp I can definately recommend it ; )","Jan 12, 2008","3","2",1,3,5,6,6,6,1,"4","$457"

"hotel_199","hotel_5542","Marriott for the NYC Marathon We staid at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott over the NYC marathon weekend for two nights. It is a typical Marriott, so the amenities and overall ambiance is what you would expect from this chain. We lived in Brooklyn for close to a decade, so it was our preference for marathon weekend, which is an incredibly tight market for hotel rooms. Compared to other hotels in New York, this particular Marriott鈥檚 rooms are enormous (we had two double beds) and very clean and new. This same room in Manhattan would have cost at least double the price. I observed the staff to be conscientious to guests and they were very timely fulfilling our specific requests. You pretty much have access to all major subway lines across the street from the hotel, and Wall Street and the Financial District are one subway stop away.The one drawback I can see is, as another reviewer noted, if you are using their business services, you鈥檒l pay a premium fee. I cannot envision paying for wireless access in today鈥檚 market.In closing, it is a stone鈥檚 throw from the Brooklyn Bridge, Transit Museum and Brooklyn Law School. Brooklyn Heights is a beautiful neighborhood, with great views of the city, fabulous restaurants, and great people watching. My favorite independent natural foods store in bklyn, Perelanda, is nearly right across the street. It鈥檚 a great base if you plan on exploring the most populous borough in NYC, as well as the bright lights of Manhattan.","Nov 8, 2007","7","6",5,6,6,6,6,6,2,"4","$457"

Your head is supposed to sink into a pillow but these pillows are like rock buns, compared to the beautiful pillows the Hyatt have in their rooms. How can I explain?When you put your head sideways onto a pillow it's supposed to 'sink in' slightly, but there's no sinking in, just a huge gap between your head and the mattress so there's alot of strain on your neck.Staff are snobby and I can't stand that anywhere, In the restuarant, I funny old Jewish bird and her hubby complained that their steak was overdone and sent it back!

There are three major subway lines within 2 minutes of walking and that was great...you could get anywhere in Manhattan very fast. It was $30 for a cab/car to and from LaGuardia.

And thecutting edge quite often didn't make it into many of the conferencerooms leaving business executives in the cold.THEN, the service to print your boarding pass (a big time saver at the airport) requires an additional charge as well in the so-calledbusiness center - where you also had to pay this charge to print ANY document from their computer!It would seem that all of these charges are the usual Marriott business screwjob.Hotel itself is OK for New York, noisy during the day due to schools in the neighborhood.","Oct 26, 2007","7","4",2,4,3,5,4,2,2,"4","$457"

I am greeted getting out of the taxi by Welcome Back from the front entrance to the front desk. The other day I locked my room key in my room. I took my ID to the front desk to get a new card and the person there, Beverly, told me she knew who I was, she did not need the ID. She gave me a new key card immediately.The concierge lounge on the 23rd floor is a pleasure. I am alway greeted with hugs from Leonard and Donald. They make me feel more than welcome, and honestly, their hospitality is a prime reason I keep coming back here. I have been coming here for 8 years, and look forward to many more.The other night I had a sore throat and told Donald I was going back to my room. Shortly I heard a knock on the door and their was Donald with hot coffee and chocolate covered strawberries for me. Is it any wonder I feel so welcome here. Leonard and Fatwa in the morning are thebest too. All I have to do is ask, and they find it for me. This morning I asked about cranberry juice. They were out of the little bottles.

The Marriott is an extremely comfortable hotel - beds large, clean, and lots of pillows - best sleep we have had in ages. Rooms are very quiet with coffee maker, fridge, flat screen tv and powerful shower in bathroom. Also the hairdryer was good - not one where you have to hold your finger on the button to get it to work! Cant comment on the restaurant as we ate out at the many lovely cafes and delis to be found in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Getting into Manhattan was no problem as there are many subways close to the hotel - $2 a trip. As stated before in previous comments we found the people of New York very friendly and helpful. Would recommend taking an open top bus tour at start of your trip - gives you an idea of where the sights are and what you might like to see.

Room Internet did not work but I survived and had better things to do anyway.Hotel and room was clean, orderly and as requested. View was just looking into the central area, but the real view is at the BH Promenade. We were there for a family event and had several rooms. We kept the doors open since we were all going back and forth and the security coming around telling us of the hotel policy of needing to keep the doors closed was a little too post 9-11 paranoi'ish for me.

"hotel_199","hotel_8862","Excellent hotel in a great location I had a great stay with my family at this hotel. The location can't be beat. It is very close to several subway lines that can take you just about anywhere you want to go. Montague Street has nice little restaurants and a produce store. Try the Irish food at Eammon's Irish pub! At least one day when you are in the city, you should walk back to the hotel over the Brooklyn Bridge. We walked from the Sea port (Pier 17) and it didn't seem nearly as long as it looked. The pedestrian area is actually over the cars rather than to the side, so it isn't as noisy as you might expect. Also, don't miss Grimaldi's pizza, under the Brooklyn Bridge.The hotel room itself was great. The beds and bedding were very comfortable. Everything was new and clean. The staff was helpful and quick to respond. At times they didn't have enough staff when the lobby was crowded. It was very quiet. Between the quiet, the comfy beds, the black-out curtains, and the exercise from walking around the city, we found it hard to get up before 9:30!The only negative regarding the hotel was the restaurant. We ate here one day and one member of our party had an excellent meal, but the others were poor to middling, especially considering the expense. Service was slow. If you are an NYC tourist, do yourself a favor and try the many wonderful little cafe's and restaurants that aren't chains. These are where we mostly ate and we were never disappointed.I would also like to echo what others have said about the friendliness of New Yorkers. Often when our family was looking confused over a map, someone would come up and help us. Other times we would ask random strangers for help and everyone was friendly and helpful--and most people seemed to know exactly how to get everywhere!","Sep 15, 2007","3","3",5,6,6,6,5,6,4,"4","$457"

We were ever so pleased - this is a top notch, cosmopolitan, excellent hotel in a great location. One day we walked across the bridge to Manhattan, a lovely view and easy walk. Mostly, though, we explored Brooklyn, which has a lot to offer. Good restaurants, music scene, great neighborhoods, and the promenade, which we have all seen in so many movies (it's that waterside walkway that looks over to lower Manhattan). The hotel staff and service were great, which is par for Marriott. Our room was brand new (we learned the new wing, a twin of the original hotel, was just added a few months ago), comfortable, and featured a state-of-the-art set up for computer hookups that looked like the easiest I have ever seen. There was also an i-pod compatible clock radio. Bed fantastic. All in all, a really good hotel in an interesting and convenient location.

These folks go above and beyond with the type of customer service that surpasses some 5 Diamond properties. Everyone from the front desk staff to the Conference Service staff to the banquet staff to the sales team and the General Manager are there to make sure that they meet and exceed your expectations.

Chose the Marriott for its location near our daughter, the Brooklyn Bridge and many subway lines. We selected a Deluxe View Room wanting views of Manhattan. Marriott sent me a Concierge email asking for special requests. I confirmed the View Room. When we arrived, they were full and had some difficulty finding the room with a view of Manhattan. However, after I explained how much I wanted it and that I had confirmed it, Elias went to work to find one. Nick, the Bell Captain extraordinaire, gave us tips on the best room to get. You want a corner room in the South Tower. We had a great view of both Midtown Manhattan (the Empire State Building was right in front of us) and the Statue of Liberty. The view was beautiful both day and night.The room was large and very quiet. Being on the corner, I expected street noises but there really were none. They had a great brunch on Mother's Day.It was very easy to get around town, both Brooklyn and Manhattan, from this location. We felt very safe here. A car to La Guardia cost about $30.I was afraid that the Marriott wouldn't live up to my expectations and we wouldn't get a view room but they did an excellent job for us.

Saturday morning, about 8:00 am, the roof of our room rumbled with the thunder of power drilling in the room above us. My entire family was disturbed, the noise was unrelenting. My wife asked if I booked a discount room in a construction zone to save money. I assured her i did not. The desk confirmed there was construction going on in the room above me. Why wasn't I told to expect this when i checked in? I most certainly would have asked for another room. Very, very inconsiderate and very much un-Marriott-like if you know what I mean? Our toilet leaked. The man came to fix it. He said it was fixed. It leaked again as soon as he left. We called again and was told they'll fix it tomorrow.

"hotel_199","hotel_7585","Will not go back We chose this hotel because we are Marriott platinum elite and since our daughter moved to Brooklyn, thought we would try the most convenient Marriott. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed. After having stayed over 75 nights in Marriotts in 2006 and many nights in 2007, we considered the treatment we got at this hotel to be woefully lacking. We had booked a double bedded room since we had an adult daughter accompanying us but when we got there all they had available was a king bed room without much room to even put in a rollaway if we had to. We are supposed to get a welcome snack but that was nowhere to be found. They put us in the king room with a promise to move us ASAP but after not hearing back for quite awhile finally were able to locate an acceptable room.On our return from dinner and a show we expected to have our welcome snack and to make a long story short, we were eating cheese and crackers and drinking wine at 1am in the morning because that is how long it took them to get their act together.It is a clean hotel, very well situated and comfortable but we will probably go back to the residence inn in midtown, which was a fabulous experience or move on to the Waldorf or a boutique hotel. It is too bad because we have had such wonderful experiences at Marriotts and this hotel has it all going for it but the service.

"hotel_199","hotel_7896","Great spot in Brooklyn Heights We stayed here during a busy Easter weekend where the hotel was full of airline staff, tourists and business people. The hotel is within a short 5 min walk to the Brooklyn Bridge footpath. For fun we walked from the hotel and across the Bridge into Manhattan. On a mild day it is a great walk and only takes about 30 minutes. The subway is 5 minutes away, behind the Supreme Court building across the street. Best of all, we were a short walking distance from Montague street where the restaurants and shops are concentrated. The beautiful Brooklyn Promenade and Brooklyn's famous old brownstones are not too far away. A great place for a romantic stroll.We were on the 20th floor of the newly built South wing - not much to view except other office buildings. For a NYC hotel the price is right and the hotel extras (larger than average rooms, iPod docking station, comfy beds with fat duvets, large screen TV, mini fridge) it was well worth it. So far the rooms here are the nicest and cleanest in other Marriotts we have stayed (2 in Montreal, Orlando, Toronto).The famous Grimaldi's pizza under the Brookyn Bridge is a good 20-25 minute walk. Try Celeste's diner for breakfast just 2 blocks away - huge portions and good food, saw more locals than tourists.My only complaint is the route you have to take to get to the pool/fitness center from the South wing. They are situated in the original building so you have to go down to the connecting bridge and take another elevator up to the pool. I like a quick jaunt to a hotel pool, especially if I'm in my flip flops and wet bathing suit, and have a 3-year old in tow.Also, their pool hours were limiting for families with children.I highly recommend this hotel if you want to get away from the high prices of Manhattan.","Apr 12, 2007","8","8",6,6,5,6,6,5,5,"4","$457"

The hotel is extremly close to several subway stops that take you straight to Manhattan. Can take the A,C, R, W lines all around Manhanttan and back to Brooklyn.

The rooms are a reasonable size. I had a large flat screen TV with movies on demand. The service is generally very good - restaurant staff and doormen were really good and helpful. I needed a cab at 4.45 am and the doorman was waiting for me in reception with my cab outside. Perfect.Location is excellent. There are 3 subway stops all very close which should get you to just about any part of Manhattan. One morning I got the F express (not deliberately) and was on 23rd St. in 15 minutes. Great commute!I have one complaint: I like to use the fitness centre early morning. During the week this was fine and it's open from 6am until 11.30pm. Unfortunately when I went on Saturday it only opened at 9am which was too late for me - I had to be out and about by then. The gym is run by a 3rd party and the hotel does not have a key. I suppose this is because the 3rd party monitors users and charges this back to the hotel. Surely they could find a better way of recording usage e.g. using your room key to get in, so it logs entries. The current system benefits the gym owners but not the hotel guests - given the level of service expected of Marriott I found this disappointing.","Feb 21, 2007","4","4",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$457"

"hotel_199","hotel_9456","Very good base for visiting Manhattan I arrived at check in for a 10 night stay. When asked if I preferred a King bed, two beds, etc., I asked for a reasonably nice view considering the lenght of my stay and Elizabeth happily accomadated me with a large room with a small refridgerator and a view out the front of the hotel which was pleasant. The room was great, clean, comfortable. The hotel was nice. The only time I ate at the hotel was room service once or twice and was pleasantly surprised that what I ordered was very tasty. We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge - very easy walk from the hotel for the fabulous views of Lower Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, and the bridge itself. But we got Metro cards and used the Subway for visiting all the locations in Manhattan we wanted to visit. An economical and practical way to get around. My favorite thing about the hotel was Montague Street. Forget about Fulton Plaza which is just around the corner. Montague Street is a quiet little street with many small inviting little restaurants ( Andy's is great, also La Traviata and Teresa's - not expensive yet good!), little shops including Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic, Mac, as well as little local shops and pharmacy. There is a grocery store, but check out the Garden of Eden Farmers Market (the place with the fresh fruit out front). Fresh salads, a deli, sweets - all kinds of good food. Also, Montague Wines is a really nice little shop - and they will open your bottle for you if you don't happen to have a wine opener in your room. If you walk all the way to the end of Montague street, you find yourself in a nice residential area and the promenade - a walkway where you can take a really lovely stroll and enjoy the beautiful skyline of lower Manhattan.","Dec 20, 2006","14","14",5,5,4,5,5,5,1,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_10621","Perfect for visiting Manhattan We were invited for thanksgiving by two of our friends living in Brooklyn-Hights. They recommended us this hotel and we were completely satisfyed. Of course, as foreigners, we would never have thought about to stay in a brooklyn hotel when visitng Manhattan but if you take in consideration everything, there is no better choice. The location might not be perfect at first sight, becuase it is not in Manhattan. But as there are Subway stations close to the hotel which lead you directly to all Manhattan destinations you will be there faster, as when staying in a downtown hotel. Also the rooms are more spacious as in a comparable hotel downtown and you will pay much less. The rooms were very clean and well maintained with all the amenities. The only point which was not satisfying was the at your service Telephoneline. We asked for a microwave and never got it. But on the other hand, front desk staff was very helpful and when I asked for a microwave there, we had it 5 minutes later. Also, we asked for a restaurant - booking via the at your service line but it was not accomplished, they simply fergot about it. But as we complained at the front desk, we were offered free breakfast, late check - out and several points on my marriott member account. Room service was very relayable and not too expensive. What I also liked about the room was the large, empty fridge. Used to the European Minibar where you cannot store your things and have to buy their stuff at exorbitant prices, it was a relief. The nearby area did not seem to be to nice at first sight. But head for Brooklyn heights (just behind the court building in front of the hotel) and you will be in a very friendly, nice and upscale residential area. At montague street you will find lots of small shops and very nice restaurants, even a well stocked grocery store for all your needs. Something you wont find that easy in manhattan. Also at the termination of that same montague street you will finde a terrace with the most spectacular view of manhattan. Take a stroll down the promenade and cross brooklyn bridge. It's unbelieveable but it only takes you some minutes to reach manhattan by walking and it's a wonderful experience to actually walk to there. Next time we visit new-york/manhattan we sure will return. The first time visitor might enjoy the feeling of staying in a downtown hotel near times square. But you won't find a hotel there, which is so convenient, comfortable and value for money as this one.","Dec 7, 2006","15","15",5,5,6,5,6,4,1,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_2096","The best way to see New York City One of the best ways I found to see the New York City skyline is from the Brooklyn Bridge. The view of both the midtown and lower Manhattan skylines is magnificent from this vantage point. My favorite hotel chain is Marriott and they have one of their very best NYC properites located at 333 Adams St. This is just a short walk from the foot of the bridge! Now combine these two together and one can easily see why an individual like myself who travels to New York 15-20 times per year picks this top shelf property 9 out of every 10 times. Now some more things that make this property special. Very few hotels in the city have a complete work out center, hot tub and lap pool. This place has all 3! Very reasonable on-site parking and excellent acess to the subway! Blocks away from the new and very hip Montague and Smith Streets where one can enjoy limitless yummy dining choices :) Across the street is the MTA subway museum, think about it, how was the subway system built in an exisiting city? your going to have to go and find out....The hotel just completed a new 280 room addition with rooms that offer of view of the skyline and the bridge.The new Concierge lounge (2outdoor decks on the 23rd floor-really cool)and Archives Restraunt are fabulous! Now the best part of this hotel experience is the friendly staff that treat you like family! If you don't believe me go meet Don in the concierge lounge or several of the front desk ladies and you will see what i'm talking about. Make your RSVPs now and i will probably see you there.","Nov 29, 2006","15","14",5,5,6,6,6,6,5,"4","$457"

"hotel_199","hotel_1944","Fantastic Service! We got married on Sat, 11/04/06, one day before the NYC Marathon. We started working with the Marriott early in the year to reserve a room block for our guests, in advance of the marathon driving room rates up. From the very beginning, the staff was exceptionally helpful. They helped us secure a great rate and all our guests reported having virtually flawless check-ins and check-outs and really enjoying the rooms - the hotel recently opened a new tower and the rooms are quite nice. Additionally, while we didn't have our reception at the hotel, we did organize a number of activities at the hotel. We arranged for guests to have drinks and light snacks in between the ceremony and the reception. Guests said that the hotel staff was waiting for them when they arrived and directed them to the reserved space in their bar/lounge area. Also, we had a gathering after the reception ended - again in the bar area. Once again, great service - we all had a ton of fun. And then, the Marriott helped us have a fun  fizzy end to our wedding weekend - working with us to organize a brunch that was delicious and again perfectly staffed.overall - a wonderful, wonderful experience with highly competent and friendly people and a very lovely space.","Nov 20, 2006","5","4",6,6,6,6,6,6,1,"4","$457"

"hotel_199","hotel_4392","Maids personally serve as alarm clocks We stayed at the Brooklyn Marriot the weekend of 10/21. We typically stay at Marriotts  are usually more than satisfied. There were no excuses for any of the mishaps we experienced this particular weekend. First, it took over a 1/2 hour to check in. It seems as if this hotel serves as a popular convention site. There were long lines of people trying to check in and the staff appeared to move at a snails pace. The rooms were nice  very spacious, especially for NY rooms. However, the towels were so frayed  worn that I would not even use them for rags. That Friday evening, we had plans outside of the immediate area. We went downstairs to grab a cab. No cabs in site  only one bellhop working. He was trying to hail cabs for the 10 people in front of us, along with trying to service guests  their luggage checking in/ out. It got to the point where people were actually in the middle of the busy road trying to hail cabs themselves. There is no execuse for only one bellhop working on a Friday night  for no taxis being readily available. The most upsetting thing of all was HAVING THE MAID KNOCK ON OUR DOOR AT 8:30 IN THE MORNING ON SUNDAY TO SEE IF WE WERE CHECKING OUT SOON. Then, to top it off she came back at 10:00 to see if we were leaving. There is NO execuse for that..period. This hotel is seriously lacking  I would not stay here for free.","Oct 24, 2006","10","5",2,5,3,3,2,2,5,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_10282","Manager Very Accommodating in Fixing Reservation Mixup When I arrived at the Marriott Brooklyn Bridge on Thursday Oct. 19, I found that my reservation had been incorrectly registered for April 19-21, 2007 rather than Oct. 19-21, 2006, at which point I was staring at, first, no room whatsoever, and then at a room charged at a rate sharply higher than that for which I had contracted over the phone. After the desk clerk put me in touch by phone with the Manager, May Elouri, she listened to my concern carefully and with an open mind, ultimately taking responsibility for having the hotel make good on my original reservation on the original terms. Ms. Elouri responded to my plight in a thoroughly professional and courteous manner, making possible what proved to be a wonderful stay at the Marriott Brooklyn Bridge. The Hotel itself was lovely: clean, spacious, well-appointed, and marked by first-class service. I would happily return.","Oct 23, 2006","2","2",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"4","$457"

The concierge was over-the-top helpful  gracious  bellhops were attentive. There's a nice lounge, almost living room-like, outside the bar area, which is perfect for gathering. We had a delicious buffet-style breakfast in Archives (hotel restaurant). Our kids enjoyed the lap-style pool (check the pool hours though)  husband loved the gym equipment.

"hotel_199","hotel_8267","Lots of Problems I attended a conference for 5 days and was very disappointed with the hotel, but happy with the staff, who were uniformly friendly and courteous. I would never have chosen this hotel if the conference were not being held here. Our safe was broken so they finally changed our room late at night. We were put into a brand new room in the tower, and the safe in that room was jammed! We spent hours (literally) with security coming in and out trying to fix it, without any luck. The next day they finally found an engineer who had the key to open it from the back. Then, when we were packing to leave, our code wouldn't open the safe! It took 2 hours to get security to finally figure out how to open it. There were no drink vending machines in our part of the hotel. When you check in, ask for a refrigerator since the rooms don't have them. Better yet, make the request when you make your reservation. The breakfast buffet was overpriced ...$25...and many items on it were all gone by 8:45AM. 20 minutes after I asked to have those things replenished, they were still empty. Find the Garden of Eden Market on Montague Street, just a couple of blocks from the hotel, and stock up on drinks, snacks and breakfast foods. They were our grocery, deli, etc. A great place to buy sandwiches to take with us on the train or plane. To their credit, the manager gave me a fair refund when I asked for it. But I had to find the right manager, not a low-level flunky who was only authorized to make a token offer.","Sep 20, 2006","10","7",3,3,2,6,4,6,1,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_4203","Sterile Convention Hotel I stayed at the Marriott New York at the Brooklyn Bridge in late July 2006 because I was attending a conference in the hotel. The hotel is fine for what it is - a standard issue commercial hotel catering to groups and conferences. My room was very large by New York standards with two queen beds, good sized desk and a small sitting area. The room was clean and quiet with very little outside noise. The beds were comfortable and in a nod to Marriot鈥檚 new focus on bedding, overloaded with pillows. Bathroom was also large but basic tile - no marble or upgrades here. The overall hotel d茅cor is undistinguished with an unrelenting 1980s-looking teal and peach color scheme.For a business hotel, I found the wireless internet access to be lacking. I was never able to get a connection in the lobby or meeting rooms despite assurances that wireless was available. One of the staff members who help set up for our conference told me that the hotel does not have wireless in the meeting rooms in order to force the conferences to pay separately for internet access for their meetings.I did not eat in the hotel restaurant during my stay but had food provided by the hotels banquet department for our conference. We were served box lunches with a turkey sandwich and chips three days in a row. My husband who was traveling with me had the Sunday brunch and thought it was pretty good with made-to-order omelets. For other meals we took the subway to Manhattan to eat. On the last day we had some extra time and asked the hotel concierge for information. He was enthusiastic and knowledgeable - our best staff interaction of the trip.Some of my traveling companions liked the fact that the hotel was very near the subway and only one stop from lower Manhattan. But I did not like the location and would not stay there again unless I had to for a conference. While the hotel faces an attractive broad boulevard with the NY Supreme Court buildings across the street, behind the hotel is a dingy retail area. When arriving at the hotel, I took a wrong turn coming out of the subway and wandered past several blocks with dirty convenience stores and trash strewn sidewalks.I found the hotel adequate and cheap ($179 for conference attendees in the middle of the summer) but unremarkable.","Sep 9, 2006","5","4",4,5,3,4,4,4,3,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_2920","A decent alternative to staying in Manhattan..if the price is right I assume this is one of the best hotels outside of Manhattan. Unless you could save some dollars, I don't know why you would stay in Brooklyn unless you had a specific reason. Why did I stay here? Simple - I was attending a multi-day conference at the hotel. The lobby, the meeting rooms and the guest rooms were nice - but nothing special. I thought about rating this hotel a 4 but I was a little disappointed with the maid service - varied from day to day. The first full day the housekeeper didn't arrive until around 9pm and I was working on something in my room so I just had her change out towels. The second day was great but the third was in the evening again. The layout of the hotel also results in quite a bit of walking from the elevator bank to most of the rooms. Room service was prompt and the food was slightly above average. I was a little disappointed the hotel did not have the YES network. Because of local restrictions, the Yankees-Rangers game was blacked out on ESPN but I couldn't get the game on another channel so I ended up taking the 2 train into Times Square to ESPNZone.The Fulton Street Mall nearby has a few decent places to grab a quick bite. I would imagine the hotel restaurant is probably one of the best in Brooklyn. On the plus side, the hotel provides easy access to the Borough Hall subway station. Once I got on the train, it was about a 20 minute ride to Times Square via the 2/3 line. 5-10 to Wall Street. 15 min to 14th Street and the West Village. I returned after 10pm on a couple of occasions and felt completely safe in case anyone is interested.The hotel is currently only in the first 7 floors of the building so there are no views of the Manhattan skyline. However, that could change with the hotel's 280 room expansion into the building next door, scheduled to be completed sometime this year. If you are interested in spending time in Manhattan but don't want to pay for staying there, this hotel is a relatively convenient alternative if the price is right.","Aug 1, 2006","9","7",4,5,3,4,4,3,5,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_1698","A Gem in Brooklyn I stayed here for two nights for business and was pleasantly surprized. Staff seemed aimed to help and please and the room was hands down the best room I've ever stayed in while in NYC. It was large, clean, and modern. It was also quiet from outside NY noise. I was offered internet access for a fee while there and took advantage of it, which was terrific, but it only worked in the rooms. There is a small store that had most necessities (water, medicines, sodas, etc.) that was helpful.Room service was okay - typical and nothing original. The hotel restaurant was slow for lunch, but good typical Marriott food. I appreciated the lounge in the lobby with comfortable chairs and couches for travelers to camp out and work and talk before departing. I utilized a hotel recommended car service - New Brooklyn Car Service for trips around town and into Manhattan. This worked very well and my driver was terrific. While it was about $5 more each way - it was worth it. I had tons of trouble trying to get back to the hotel from Manhattan with yellow cabs since it seems no one wants to drive to Brooklyn even if it is just over the bridge. Next time, I will have the car service pick me up at a predesignated time when I leave Manhattan. While I was attending a meeting at the Marriott, most of my day meals were taken during the meetings. They seemed to arrive late with the meals at every turn and you could see some sort of negotiation going on between wait staff, catering managers, etc. in the hall during every meal. Very un-Marriott like but a small issue.One strange thing did happen while awaiting hotel transportion - the lobby area near the car drop off had obsenity filled urban music blasting - not typical Marriott style and was a little out of place and distracting.","Jun 6, 2006","6","6",3,6,1,6,1,4,1,"4","$457"
"hotel_199","hotel_3704","Service with a snarl, and a cost I stayed at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott at the request of a client who has a negotiated rate with the hotel. It felt like the staff had been given instructions to sqeeeze money out of guests. Every interaction with a staff member outside of the housekeeping staff resulted in a discussion over money.At check-in, they refused to honor the negotiated rate and increased my price $125 per night. They said that if I came back with an ID from the client, they'd return to the lower rate, but nothing I brought them would get them to lower the rate and my client is still fighting them on this. But of course, since I was on a negotiated lower rate, I was only allowed to have a room across from the ice machine, even thought I am an elite status holder with Marriott.Same thing at the restaurant. I had the cold buffet breakfast, but was charged for the hot buffet. Why? Because I had the lox. So I pointed out that lox are cold, and on the cold buffet table. They said yes, but it's not listed on the menu. I did manage to get them to reverse this charge.At checkout, there was an extra day of charge for the internet (I used it three of the four days I was there) and they insisted that I must have used it all four, because there was no reason I could have only used it for three. This charge I got removed because I told them I would be writing a report on tripadvisor.The hotel is huge, and my room was a good one minute walk within the hotel from the elevator (not a complaint: just an observation). It was clean and nicely laid out, and the sound insulation to keep street noise out was very good. The hotel has a full service gym in it. I see it as a plus that the gym sets time aside for adult lap swimming in the pool, so that you can actually use the pool for exercise.","May 22, 2006","14","10",2,5,1,6,1,2,1,"4","$457"

However small kids banned from pool at convenient times, only available mid-morning (when kids sightseeing) or late at night (when kids in bed). Kids complained in person to managenment but complaint not acknowledged. Apparently leisure facilities independent from hotel but this is not clear on hotel website.

Breakfast was quite good with plenty of choice but quite expensive. The hotel is located on a busy street close to Fulton Mall, plenty of shops here including Macy's, and also the Atlantic Mall with Old Navy, Target and Marshalls (Not exactly 5th Ave.) On the opposite side of the street is the supreme court and behind that is Montague Street which continues on down to the promenade with spectacular views of Manhattan.We dined in the River Cafe on Water Street with its magnificent views of the Manhattan skyline (spectacular at night).

Our daughter and her family have moved to Park Slope and we wanted to try out the closest hotel. We come to NYC several times a year and have always stayed in Manhattan in the past. We were very pleased with the service and security in the hotel. Everyone was very accomodating. When we checked into our good sized room (although it was located VERY far from the elevators!), the electronic room safe did not work. The first person who came, from security, could not fix it. He promised to send up an engineer immediately and by the time we returned from a short lunch, it was working perfectly.The Health Club was well equipped and clean.We had Elite service and were able to eat complete cold breakfasts in the Concierge lounge the 7th floor. My husband is on a salt free diet and there were lots of fruits and even one type of cereal which was great for him. We only got to the lounge once in the evening; it was also pleasant then. The staff was very accomodating and offered us bottled water to take to our rooms.The hotel restaurant and bar were nice but not terribly exciting for New York City. On the other hand, a waitress remembered our drink orders from one night to the next which is very unusual for NY!The room was comfortable and I did not notice anything wrong with the amenities for the average NYC hotel at this price.The parking was wonderful - at $18 it was less than half the price of many Manhattan hotels and the service was faster than several others I could name.This is a hotel which hosts many people from various NY communities and it has a very vibrant feel to it.The surrounding neighborhood is quite interesting. I recommend a short walk to the Brooklyn Heights Palisades; it is an amazing view.Many different subway lines are very conveniently located to the hotel.Our son is in the process of moving from Florida to Manhattan but we are planning to continue to stay at the Brooklyn Marriott for most of our future visits to NY.","Aug 23, 2005","9","8",5,5,1,6,1,6,1,"4","$457"

For room rates that exceed $200 a night, you should at least get good bed linens and two-ply toilet paper. The sheets at the Marriott were either a cotton/poly blend or a very low cotton thread count; they were not at all comfortable or soft. Same for the blanket. The toilet paper is that horrible, flimsy stuff you get in a Motel 6.

"hotel_199","hotel_9270","Great hotel; one major problem! I'm giving this hotel four stars because of its sheer quality. It's beautiful - just above the escalators is a painted skyline dome. The fresh flowers at the center were always completely amazing. Rooms were a great size.However, there was one huge thing - at this hotel, they place a hold on your credit/debit card immediately when you check in - this means that money is no longer available for withdrawal. This is to ensure they get what is due to them. However, they swiped my car twice - they put a double hold on my account, which was more than i had in my account....meaning, I had NO spending money the entire trip.It was an absolute nightmare - having to wire funds, trying to figure out what the exact problem was. When it was finally fixed on the last day of my trip (stayed four days), they did give us a $100 discount on our room. For the most part, the service because of this huge problem was decent. The tub also didn't drain properly, and they gave us another discount - $50. The management always stayed calm and polite during our multiple woes, including a cancelled flight - they found us the airline number and let us use their phone.This will prompt me to never use my debit card when going to a hotel that places holds....oy vey. Otherwise - had a great stay. Someone mentioned $12.95 internet access. If you use the TV/Internet option, it is only $10 a day, which is a steal. However, some web sites would freeze, and there is no mouse. You had to do everything by keyboard.Also the business center prices were decent - everything is about $6 per half hour, this includes unlimited printing, faxing....not bad. Be sure to fill out the survey, and you get 15 minutes of computer usage free. The gift shop was, of course, expensive...but had some super cute gifts.Try the Archives Restaurant for the breakfast buffet - it's $18 a person (includes a drink) and features great omelettes and belgian waffles.I really want to stay there again, despite the problems.","Jul 14, 2005","21","20",4,5,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$457"

"hotel_199","hotel_4675","Viable Alternative to Midtown, If You've Time to Commute Although I travel extensively both for business and for pleasure and have certainly stayed in boutique and commercial hotels -- including other Marriott properties -- that I would easily rate higher, I give the Marriott New York at the Brooklyn Bridge an above average score for it鈥檚 comfortable and quiet rooms, array and availability of amenities, and general hospitality to the largely business traveler that comprises their clientele. Having never stayed anywhere other than Midtown during previous trips to the city, I was initially very put off by the location and surrounding 鈥渁mbiance鈥?of MNY@BB, which I booked for March 7-10 after having reviewed countless positive comments on Trip Advisor. Sandwiched between the monolithic, uninspired architecture of a technical institute and the monolithic, uninspired (and dingy) architecture of the New York State Supreme Court, it鈥檚 obvious that you鈥檙e not on Park Avenue anymore, Dorothy. Once inside the glass-fronted, multi-story lobby, however, I felt comforted by the lush greenery of tropical plants and the sunny sky-blue of the trompe l鈥檕eil ceiling high above me as I rode the escalator to the reception area. I reserved a standard room, but the check-in representative automatically upgraded us to a Junior Suite, owing to our status as Marriott Rewards members. The suite -- which included a small galley area with bar sink, coffee maker, and mini fridge in an alcove adjacent to the bathroom as well as a spacious sitting area with sofa, wingchair, and coffee table, and two queen sized beds 鈥?was unheard-of-huge by standards across the East River. A good-sized desk with task lighting provided a great place to dock the laptop and catch up on paperwork.All of the furnishings appeared to be quite new and were comfortable, for the most part. Feather pillows are standard issue, although housekeeping did provide us (after multiple requests) some rather flat and lower quality foam pillows. A good selection of nice lighting 鈥?including the desk light, two side table lamps, and a floor fixture 鈥?allowed us to make the room as atmospheric as we wanted. We were impressed by the lack of any type of noise at night 鈥?either from the hallway, adjoining rooms, or the street below 鈥?which made it easy to get a full night鈥檚 sleep.Although we did not utilize it, the hotel had a great gym, fully equipped with a wide variety of cardio machines, weight machines, free weights, and a good-sized lap pool.The hotel鈥檚 on-site lounge and restaurant both appeared very cozy and served a nice variety of higher-priced food, we opted for the convenience and comfort of room service during our 3-night stay. Our orders were cheerfully taken and delivered in a timely manner鈥lthough an item or two was usually missing, causing the porter to have to return to the kitchen. Quality of food was very high, with large portions. Overall, a good value for the price. Although I prefer to stay on the island, MNY@BB does offer a great alternative for those whose schedules can accommodate a 15-20 minute subway ride (a station is conveniently located just around the corner from the hotel). The location might not be glamorous, but you won鈥檛 know the difference from the comfort of your guest room!","Mar 17, 2005","15","10",4,5,1,5,1,4,1,"4","$457"
