If the weather is good, I would recommend eating at the 13 Coins Restaurant which is a short walk from the Marriott, versus eating at the hotel restaurant. There is also a 7 Eleven about a block away if one needs other things. This is a typical Marriott, where they charge you for everything, including the Internet. What bothered me most was when I had to leave at 4:30am, and was waiting for my ride in the lobby, there was no staff around, and anyone could have walked into the place. It's not a bad place, but nothing stands out as being above average either."
"Review_11002","hotel_101","hotel_5079","Dec 2, 2008","go elsewhere The place is hugely overpriced and mis-managed.Better places to stay are the Hilton or Radisson, both of which are in the same airport area.I arrived and had to walk down endless corridors before finding out my key did not work. Finally got another room, other people's hairs in the bathtub. Gross, small, old-school and pricey.Yuk!"
"Review_11003","hotel_101","hotel_8440","Nov 18, 2008","I Won't Go Back I stayed at the hotel 11/14/08 for 2 nights. I booked the package through Marriotts web site. The package incuded a deluxe room, free parking and a gas card. When we checked in we were told our room was not ready but they could give a handicapped room. I asked to look at the room. It was on the first floor facing the street and parking lot. I went back and said we would wait for our room. We came back 2 hours later and they gave me keys to room 199 which was 3 rooms away from the room we originally looked at, again facing the street and parking lot. I went back to the front desk and said I booked a deluxe room which was supposed to overlook the pool and be on a higher floor. I was told deluxe and standard rooms are the same. I was getting nowhere with the front desk. I went back to my 1st floor room and called the phone number on my marriott rewards card and explained the problem to them. I was told they would have a manager call me in my room. After no call I went to the managers office and talked to one of the managers and she said to me you want a deluxe room for the price you paid? I said yes that is what the package offers and I did not create the package I just bought Marriotts package. She then told me the package did not offer a deluxe room but a standard room. I told her that supposedly they are the same from what the front desk tells me. I told her that I had called the hotel directly before i booked and asked about the rooms and was told a deluxe room was a higher floor facing the pool. I then showed her my reservation confirmation which said deluxe room on it. The manager said well nobody else has complained. I told the manager that I could have stayed at the Hilton or Doubletree down the street cheaper and I will check out unless I get the room I paid for. Finally she says well your right I will get another room. I did get another room still on the first floor but facing the pool. The hotel was not very busy and we should have gotten the room we paid for which we never did. Bait and Switch at its best. I will stay at the Hilton or Doubletree down the street on my future visits to Seattle area. The room was okay very dark, small bathroom. The bed very comfortable. Old T.V. no flat screens."
"Review_11004","hotel_101","hotel_4592","Oct 19, 2008","Good weekend stay My wife and I stay here quite regularly when we visit Seattle to see a football game. The shuttle from the airport is always on time and operates almost 24 hours a day. The rooms are typical Marriott and always clean and functional. The restaurant is good with some very good items and others quite normal. If there is a large convention in the hotel (which occurs quite regularly on weekends) be careful where your room is(stay away from pool side). The hotel is old but has been remodeled very recently but the noise in the hallways and especially around the pool can be very annoying. Standard complaint is the charge for internet usage."
"Review_11005","hotel_101","hotel_5901","Oct 13, 2008","Great airport stay Lovely indoor pool area, looks like a lodge. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean, very comfortable and spacious, with minimal noise from outside (you could hear planes, but only if you really listened for them). The breakfast buffet was good value with great coffee (Starbucks), but the omelet chef did not have the slightest clue as to what he was doing. I got more of a scramble than an omelet, and he might have put all of three spinach leaves in the whole thing, which cooked down to nothing. I booked a cars eat free package which included parking and a $25 gas card - if they still have this deal it is worth it. Overall a very good experience."

Beautiful indoor atrium with swimming pool, hot tub etc. Guest rooms very clean, quiet and comfortable. Beds were heavenly.Setup and support for our seminar was superb.Only negative I can think of is that their breakfast buffet was ridiculously overpriced, but otherwise the bar and restaurant was excellent."
"Review_11007","hotel_101","hotel_3619","Aug 30, 2008","No Free Internet? Wow, that irritates me! This hotel is amazing. I love the rooms, I love the fitness center, and I really love the pool area. It is a huge pool with two hot tubs that are actually, hot. I know this sounds odd but the hotel smells amazing. The staff was helpful and there are some restaurants in the area. One gripe, and it's a big one. The Internet. Will you please explain to me why the more expensive hotel chains charge for wireless but motels like Comfort Inn, and La Quinta, give complimentary internet? It is the number one complaint that I have against the whole Marriott chain. Although I do realize that some of the Marriott brands (Fairfield, Courtyard) offer the complimentary internet, I just believe that for $150 a night you should receive free internet! Overall, a very nice Marriott, with exceptionally clean rooms!"
"Review_11008","hotel_101","hotel_8210","Aug 19, 2008","good business hotel stayed here one night on business.I selected this hotel simply because the workshop that I was attending was held there. Seemed expensive, at ~$250/night, so I'd shop around if I were returning to the area. The hotel is about one mile from the airport, so very convenient in that regard. A complimentary shuttle runs every 15 minutes, and this is also a plus. My room (and based on what I saw, the other standard rooms) was not very big, but was well-appointed: luxurious king bed, chest of drawers, armchair with footstool, desk with work chair, Starbucks in-room coffee. The bathroom and amenities were nice. The room was clean and reasonably quiet. I did not bring my laptop, so can't comment on the internet connection, however, there is a business center with 2 computer stations where travelers can check email, etc, no charge. There is also a kiosk especially for doing airline web check-in so you can print your boarding pass, a nice touch. The hotel has an atrium, where the pool and jacuzzis are located. It is quite nice, with trees. The fitness room was better than I encounter at most hotels. They had a selection of cardio equipment: bikes, treadmills, elliptical trainers, plus some weight machines and free weights. There is a somewhat pricey cafe in the hotel. I had breakfast and lunch there. The food and service were good. There does not seem to be any other place to eat within walking distance. The staff were nice and courteous. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to a business traveler."

"Review_11010","hotel_101","hotel_7928","Jun 12, 2008","Wow! This place was amazing! We booked it solely because of its proximity to the airport (a 5 minute shuttle ride) and were dazzled when we checked in. The whole place is done up to look like a lodge. Beautiful wood beams everywhere. The pool was enormous. Our room was small, but beauiful, and a terrific bargain. I'd like to stay there again, for longer this time."
"Review_11011","hotel_101","hotel_4210","Jun 6, 2008","Nice and Comfortable The rooms here were very comfortable. The bed was awesome; attractively made-up and super comfy. I do agree that the halls/elevator set-up is a little tricky, but asides from that small detail, I had a pleasant stay. I ate one meal in the main restaurant as well and it was quite good. It took a little while to get our food, but we were the first customers after they opened for lunch, so they probably had to turn on the stoves and stuff."

"Review_11013","hotel_101","hotel_2549","Mar 27, 2008","Great short stay! Arrived in the middle of the night after hours of delay at airports. Staff was very welcoming, refunded us the $ we had to pay for a cab from airport since shuttle was not available at those hours. Was also given a discounted rate since we would be departing in a few hours. The rooms were very nice, wonderful beds, nice bathrooms. Service and food choices in the hotel restaurant were excellent. Didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it looked fantastic. Shuttle driver back to airport in the morning was friendly, helpful and efficient. We were recharged and ready to continue our trip after a horrible start!"

"Review_11015","hotel_102","hotel_1790","Oct 18, 2008","Great place I have stayed at the Del Sol many times and think its a steal as far as the price and the location go. The marina district in san francisco is probably the best locale in the city however there are only motels on lombard that are seedy you would never stay there. Along comes the del sol. it has a monopoly on travelers who want to stay in the marina at a safe nice hotel with no add ons and no frills. the continental breakfast is excellent too."
"Review_11016","hotel_102","hotel_7506","Oct 5, 2008","Great Stay, Great Rooms We stayed at HDS for 5 days from August 15. We have 3 children (5,8,10) and had a great set up. We had room 326 which had a room for the kids, and our room with small kitchen area and bathroom. Really clean and comfortable, very bright and cheery. The breakfast was basic but did the job. Missed a normal cup of tea though. Pool was good for the kids after a day sightseeing. Hotel was in a great area and we walked to Fisherman's Wharf one day. Only negative was hearing noise during the night from both the street and other rooms but I believe they are trying to recify that. Would definately stay there again."
"Review_11017","hotel_102","hotel_7447","Sep 30, 2008","Highly Recommend Hotel Del Sol My stay at Hotel Del Sol was fantastic. It is a clean, quaint, pleasant place very conveniently located to the Marina and the Bay. The staff is very helpful and the rooms are comfortable and spacious. The prices were fair and the breakfast was delicious, especially the coffee.I would definitely stay here again!"
"Review_11018","hotel_102","hotel_1230","Sep 28, 2008","Best service EVER at a hotel! We only stayed for one night, but it was wonderful. I had to call the hotel a few times before we arrived and every time anyone who answered was so accomodating. Robin and Jorge who work the front desk are wonderful. They went above and beyond to do whatever it took to make our stay fabulous. The next morning we needed to check out, but weren't flying out until late that night. They helped us plan our entire day and even let us keep our bags behind the front desk while we went sightseeing. When we returned, they had called a car to take us to the airport. I plan to return to San Fran and will never stay anywhere else."

"Review_11020","hotel_102","hotel_2637","Aug 28, 2008","Great as Always! We stayed at the Hotel Del Sol August 20-24, 2008 for 4 nights. We Have been there before 3 years ago and as it was before, it was a nice experience.We booked the FAMILY SUITE, it comes with 1 queen bed in one room and a children's room with a twin trundle bed (it used to have bunk beds, not sure why they changed, safety perhaps?). This is a nice room for a family of 4-6 as the childen's room has enough room to throw a twin blow up mattress or two on the floor. The room also comes with a mini kitchenette. When I say MINI I mean mini, very small, but enough room to bring snacks, a few cold drinks in the 'fridge, small sink, etc.They offer a breakfast but it's very basic. Danish, bagels, toast, bananas, apples, coffee, juice, milk and THAT'S IT! If that's enough for you, it's great and saves a few bucks as SF is expensive!Also, on Friday night they offer a bbq although they don't advetise it much. Make sure to ask the front desk about it. We forgot all about it and by the time we got back from sightseeing, we missed it.The front desk staff are very knowlegable about the buses, local eateries, etc. Very helpful.The hotel is in a nice area, the Marina District, close to so much: Golden Gate Bridge, Fort Mason, Fisherman's Wharf and everything else is a bus or cable car ride away!!All in all we had a great stay at HDS, as we did before and we will stay again in the future."
"Review_11021","hotel_102","hotel_1112","Aug 14, 2008","Not convinced The hotel does the basics quite well but do not expect too much.The location is a plus, quite central, some nearby shops and reasonably priced cafes and about a 15-20 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf.Breakfast can be a bit sparse and you grab and go, either sitting outside if there is room or take things back to your bedroom. Supplies are replenished but you'll probably need more if you're used to a good breakfast.Rooms can be bit noisy with other guests walking around.There are additional support structures holding up the top 2 floors which are a bit concerning when you arrive.Car parking can be tight and we usually finished up in the overflow area in the next street.Overall adequate, but would probably not stay here again."
"Review_11022","hotel_102","hotel_10343","Jul 26, 2008","Value? Our family stayed here for three days and have mixed feelings about the hotel. We loved the location, it was off the beaten path, but close to Union street which had lots to look at and eat. The marina district was fun to get to know and we enjoyed our time away from the hotel. The hotel recently (I guess) has had some issues with structural support or something, because there were exposed support pillars with yellow tape put all over them holding up the second floor. We didn't notice any sagging or dangerous looking cracks, but it wasn't what we expected when arriving. The walls and ceiling were thin in our room and we joked about the dinosaurs wrestling upstairs each night. The pool was small, but the weather wasn't hot enough for that to be an issue. Parking was free, but if you couldn't find a parking space inside the courtyard you had to park next door where there are signs every 10 feet telling you to take everything out of your car which doesn't leave you with the most confident feeling about the neighborhood. Our room was small, but clean and functional. The bathroom was Parisian in size and didn't have space to place our daily toiletries . Breakfast was very basic (coffee, orange juice, rolls) and we ended up eating breakfast away from the hotel to fill up. The overall value of the hotel is questionable. We paid $177 a night thinking we would save money on parking and breakfast, but it didn't work out as well as planned. San Francisco is an expensive place, so I am not sure if there are better places out there for families looking to cut costs. Next time I go to SF I will probably not stay at the Hotel Del Sol."
"Review_11023","hotel_102","hotel_5045","Jul 22, 2008","Great Family of 5 Hotel in San Francisco! Stayed at Hotel Del Sol based on TA recommendations and one from a friend. Very nice, quaint motor lodge, very colorful, I almost felt as if we were in another time/place than San Francisco! Our room was nice for a family of 5, convenient to ride the bus all around, great thai restaurant behind the hotel. Very nice bar b que for the hotel guests on Friday, July 4 that we all enjoyed, didn't know the marina district was so close and so cool. I would definately recommend this hotel again to another large family, the gentleman doing the bar b que and stocking the continental breakfast was incredibly nice. The breakfast was so so, but these are lean hard times. The pool was smalled than what we thought, but hey, it's San Francisco! We just really enjoyed Hotel Del Sol, thanks for all who wrote in."
"Review_11024","hotel_102","hotel_7159","Jul 15, 2008","Good hotel for the price If you are accustomed to staying at 4 or 5 star hotels, this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for a clean and spacious room in a quiet motor inn for a reasonable rate, this is a good bet. Our family of 4 stayed in a suite - bedroom and living room with a pullout sofa. The pullout sofas aren't the most comfortable beds in the world but if your kids aren't from The princess and the pea, it is fine. It was nice to have a refrigerator so we could have cold drinks. The bathroom is a bit small but functional and the nice soap and toiletries were a special touch. There is also a safe in one of the closets. At one point the toilet needed a plunger and a handyman showed up at the door within a minute of hanging up the phone.The staff is incredibly helpful and even gave us the addresses for the Mrs. Doubtfire house and the Full House home. Upon check-in there were cookies in the lobby and the morning breakfast (eaten poolside) was a nice way to start the day. The bright decor puts you in a festive mood and the hammocks in the courtyard are a great way to relax. Again, it was amazing how quiet it was at night - I credit the management staff who reminds people upon check -in that they need to be considerate of others (sad that they need to actually tell people that but we're thankful that they do)We walked to everything from here as we do on every vacation but I know that there is a nearby bus stop. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel."
"Review_11025","hotel_102","hotel_8186","Jul 11, 2008","Quaint Hotel! We were guests at the Del Sol 6/20 - 6/23, 2008. Overall, we liked this hotel and would recommend it. The location is terrific for touring San Francisco by cable car, by foot or by the MUNI. The complimentary BBQ the evening of our arrival was a HUGE plus as was the free parking on premises. This hotel is kid-friendly with a nice sized court yard next to the pool for play. There were two minor issues: 1. The telephones in our room were not operational. 2. The remote controls provided did not operate either of the TV's in our suite. Many of the guests we met were repeat visitors. We would likely return to this hotel when visiting San Francisco in the future."
"Review_11026","hotel_102","hotel_10161","Jun 30, 2008","Hotel del Sol was perfect for our family! We stayed two nights at the Hotel del Sol in the Marina district of San Francisco. It was the perfect place for our family. The hotel is one of those true motels built around a motor court. It has been updated with vibrant colors and basic but comfortable amenities. For us the location was ideal. Once we pulled into our FREE parking spot, we never used our car again until we left. The hotel clerks were knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. They helped us figure out the public transportation, restaurant reservations and more. At days end the pool was fabulous. It is not huge, but it is clean and has a shallow end for my little one. They provide pool toys, goggles, etc. My kids were satisfied with the basic bagel and pastry breakfast. But the hotel is also very close to many cafes and other restaurants if you want more. If you are looking for luxury, go to Union Square, but if you want a clean, family-friendly place then this is it. I would stay there again as it fit my budget and my style perfectly."
"Review_11027","hotel_102","hotel_9353","Jun 18, 2008","Not for older travelers Five of us stayed here in 2 rooms. Two of us were 70 years old at the time of the trip. I would not book them here again. Although there is an elevator, there are still stairs that have to be negotiated once you exit the elevator, regardless of where your room is. This was difficult for the older travelers among us, and something that would keep me from booking them at this hotel again. There is also a big disparity in the size of the rooms. One room was a king. The other had 2 double beds. The double bed room was the smallest hotel room I have been in the US. I would say it was average size for a European hotel room. In contrast the king room had a kitchen with fridge, microwave, utensils, an extra pull out couch, and a big bathroom. Also, both rooms had showers only, which may not work for those with kids who still take baths. On the upside, the location is great, if you don't want to be with the tourist hoards near Ghiradelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf. We have always liked Cow Hollow and chose the hotel for that reason. Our daughter loved the heated pool. Public transportation (bus) is easy from the hotel. The people who work at the hotel are nice and will quiet people down who violate the quiet hours rule. I don't know if I would stay here again, but it may be the best choice in the neighborhood. Free parking is a huge bonus, and when the spots fill up underneath the hotel, they have a lot across the street."
"Review_11028","hotel_102","hotel_7527","Jun 15, 2008","great stay They went above and beyond what they needed to for under 200 dollars in San Fran. 7 minutes you were at the water. We stayed here to compete in the Alcatraz Triathlon and thought it was a great location. The only issue is the rooms are open to the outside with people walking by. First night we were awakened frequently second night we turned on the AC and the noise blocked out the outside noise. Breakfast in the morn with paper was nice touch. 5 min drive to Golden Gate Bridge."
"Review_11029","hotel_102","hotel_10590","Jun 13, 2008","Wish we could have stayed longer! We just completed a road trip through California traveling down the coast with our 3 kids. We all loved the Hotel Del Sol. We appreciated the convenient parking this hotel offers. Traveling with kids, I appreciated having a door to our bedroom. We enjoyed the clean room and colorful decor. I highly recommend purchasing a City Pass which allows free transportation and passes to the Exploratorium and Aquarium of the Bay. Though the hotel isn't located close to the wharf or other areas where you see a lot of hotels, with our City Pass, we found it easy to get anywhere we wanted to go. We loved Pizza Orgasmica around the corner and had take out with a bottle of wine from a store nearby. One night the hotel hosted a happy hour with food for both kids and adults. Would definitely stay here again!"

We are both in our Mid-20's. 2 blocks from the bars off of Union, $7 cab ride to Pier 39, $8 cab ride to snob hill. They had a free BBQ and drinks for us on Friday night in the fun courtyard. The downsides which my gf didn't care for was the single room with 2 double beds (hard beds might I mention) and a small pool. $199 a night is a good value and had a great time in SF."

As an ex-San Franciscan it was a fun place to stay, but I don't think I would recommend it for first time travelers. It is a little off the beaten path.It worked great for us because we could go visit the playground and a couple other haunts my girls loved. the rooms were really clean. The pool is outdoor which in SF is a waste -- too cold to use it. And don't bring a big car or you won't be able to park it in their garage."
"Review_11032","hotel_102","hotel_8882","May 9, 2008","Great family hotel Last August we stayed at the Hotel Del Sol, in the Cow Hollow district of San Francisco for 4 days. We have 3 boys and stayed in one of their suites. We loved this hotel. The living room had a pull out couch for the boys, a TV, refridgerator, and some chairs. There was a separate bedroom for us and a regular bathroom. The hotel had continental breakfast every day and we brought it up to our room and ate in the living room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is great, in a quiet neighborhood but still accessible to all the buses. We did a lot of bus travel and walking. There is a pool but it was too cold for us. San Francisco is chilly in August! The hotel also has a small sauna that we used a few times.The hotel also provides free parking with the price of your room which was a great bonus. This is really a great place for families who want to be in the city."
"Review_11033","hotel_102","hotel_1207","Mar 24, 2008","Nice place at a good price! We stayed at the Hotel del Sol while in town for a four day vacation/family visit. Overall, the hotel is lovely. The rooms are average-sized and comfortable, the grounds are very nice and the staff are amazing - universally friendly and accommodating. In fact, they are probably the best hotel staff I have encountered in 30 years of traveling. The hotel is in the Cow Hollow/Marina district, which means it is not in the heart of tourist San Francisco; if you're looking for that, you'd be better off booking a hotel near Fisherman's Wharf. What the area around the Hotel del Sol does provide is a lively neighborhood feel with tons of nice restaraunts, parks and shops within easy walking distance. The only remotely negative thing about this hotel is that it does cater to families with children, which means that occasionally you will run into parents who think vacation means that they don't have to discipline their children. We were on the second floor, and the children in the room above us were practicing their skateboard jumps at 10 p.m. I called the front desk, and the problem was taken care of immediately - another example of the great service we found at this hotel. Still, in the future, I plan to book a room on the top floor to avoid further problems."

I stayed for a conference trusting the fact that it is related to the Hilton line. The people at the front desk were wonderful, polite, helpful, really nice consistently. My trip back to the airport was a breeze since they arranged everything on time, with a good company. The furniture is nice and practical, but the hallways smelled terrible. The rooms were not cleaned optimally and inconsistently things like soap, coffee etc were replaced. The room has a small kitchen and all the appropriate appliances, which I think it is a plus, but the room itself is somewhat crowded.The room is on top of a busy highway that would not stop all night long. I could not sleep at peace."
"Review_11039","hotel_103","hotel_5086","Dec 9, 2008","Free Everything! This hotel is fantastic. I should stress that I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites before so I didn't know that they included so much in the base rate, but we were blown away. Among the things that this place provided for free were 'light dinner' (which could really suffice as dinner i.e. meatloaf, lasagne etc), alcoholic drinks every night we were there (Mon-Thurs), free hot breakfast, free in-room internet and a free shuttle to major sites. We were upgraded to a suite which was very roomy and had a great kitchen. It was a very nice room. The only negatives with the hotel were that the comforter/doona was scratchy (as a previous reviewer noted), and that the business centre broke and despite assurances of it will be fixed in two/three hours, it never was. Everything else about this hotel was excellent. The location is right near downtown - it's only a 5 minute walk (maximum) to the heart of downtown Seattle, and only 10 minutes or so to Pike Place Market. We walked basically everywhere, including to the Seattle Centre, the wharf to get the Bainbridge Island Ferry, and to Pioneer Square from this hotel. We only had to get a bus when we went to Fremont.I would definitely recommend the Homewood Suites Hilton for Seattle. What a great place!"

Its a great escape from the busy Seattle hustle and bustle outside. They also serve a complementary breakfast and welcome home light dinner. I love it! and wish I could stay longer!! I have heard some construction and see it in the lobby, but its not disrupted my stay at all."

The boyfriend and i stayed in this unique place due to him being in Seattle for business. It was a great location due to it being a bit off the beaten path from the business of the city yet close enough to walk everywhere I wanted to go. The rooms are incredibly large and for the price that we paid, we felt that we got a great bang for our buck! The comforter on the bed was really scratchy, and the front entrance to the hotel was under contstruction, but other than that, I would definitely reccomend this place to my friends and other travelers."
"Review_11044","hotel_103","hotel_1191","Mar 10, 2008","Great value, comfortable hotel Pike Street Suites is a hotel of excellent value, conveniently located, spacious, with many comforts. My husband and I chose this hotel on a 3-day weekend for its location and low price (we paid $119 + tax on Expedia for a 1-br king suite). It had been recommended by my sister. The suite was large, very clean and true to the advertised floor plan. Contemporary furnishings, two plasma TVs, decent lighting, free wireless internet, and free local phone calls. We only used the refrigerator and microwave, but there was a full kitchen for meal preparation. The bed was very comfy, with crisp, quality linens, comfy pillows and excellent mattress. I particularly appreciated the blackout window shades. I did not hear any freeway or road noise from our courtyard-view room, and I am typically a light sleeper. We also enjoyed the medium sized private balcony, which overlooked cherry trees blossoming in the courtyard.The bathroom is average+. Marble counter and contemporary fixtures, but only an average sized tub and vanity area. Nothing terribly fancy, but perfectly clean. The workout room is small but has all the equipment I wanted. It was warm enough to enjoy the heated outdoor pool and jacuzzi, which were cozy but quite nice. There is also an indoor jacuzzi. The hotel is a short walk (uphill!) from the convention center and downtown shopping. Last fall, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, which is about 3 blocks away. While the Grand Hyatt is elegant and more luxurious, we had much more space at Pike Street Suites at about half to 1/3 the price. The lobby is still undergoing renovations, but we were not bothered by construction noise. Breakfast-in-a-bag was available, but we did not try it. A conversion to Homewood Suites is expected for later this spring. Hopefully, the hotel will retain its charms."

Good shopping/restaurants nearby. Rooms are old and dusty, and windows don't close easily (I had to switch rooms). Gym is small but doable."
"Review_11046","hotel_103","hotel_3393","Jan 8, 2008","Nice Renovations; Bed Type Issues Booked through Expedia, which guaranteed a King Bed. Because I'm wary of such promises when I didn't book direct with the hotel, I called the day of arrival to reconfirm a non-smoking King. The desk agent reconfirmed the bed type, so I felt confident about getting what we were promised.At check it, I saw that the Registration Card also stated Nonsmoking King, so I didn't reconfirm it with the desk clerk - I thought that would be overkill.We found our room - the halls are definitely taking some wear and tear from the renovations, but the room was beautiful - hardwood floors, well-appointed kitchenette, beautiful large bathroom, very comfortable modern sofa and a queen sized bed!We didn't notice the size of the bed until after we were completely unpacked (we were staying four nights), so didn't feel like re-packing and moving, so we didn't ask management to correct the situation. But it was mildly annoying to have taken so much effort, even on the day of arrival, and to have our promised bed type switched out from under us at check in.Otherwise, the stay was nice - good breakfast in the lobby each morning, with hot options in addition to cold. And it was very nice to have the kitchen - we were able to make hot tea and chocolate every afternoon after cold days in Seattle's December weather.We usually stay here because of the excellent location between downtown and first hill. We can generally walk anywhere, and we very much enjoy that.On the day of departure we called to see if the hotel shuttle was available to take us to the train station - I had asked the day before and was told they didn't take reservations and it was on a first come, first served basis. I was told that the van had just left in the opposite direction and wouldn't be back for at least 45 minutes, so we took a cab instead. After checking our luggage at the train station, we walked a block to a coffee shop and were passed on the street by the hotel shuttle!Having stayed here regularly for the last 8 years or so, I must say that the details have usually been handled better than during this stay. These little blips weren't enough to make me move to another hotel, but repeats of the same will definitely make me think about it, if I see similar issues in the future."
"Review_11047","hotel_104","hotel_2024","Nov 10, 2008","Convenient  When I say Above Average I'm comparing to sparse alternative offerings in the Ponce area (and being an avid golfer, this place having no competition in the south central portion to the island). The resort was easy to get to and conveniently located, but it (in the greater worldwide scheme of things) wasn't anything close to special. Furthermore (aside from the outstanding 27 hole on site golf course), it was not redeeming other than it was situated on the ocean (to be more precise, the Carribean Sea) and had two separate pool and beach areas (one moderate size family pool with large beach area at hotel, and another dazzling adult pool with small beach area at the golf course clubhouse complex). We ate out in town, but availed ourselves to the bar lounge area (good, but expensive mixed drinks and beer) and to the casino (okay, but not exciting and no Vegas - or Mesquite, for that matter). The rooms were clean and all have a view toward the ocean overlooking the gardened grounds, but it was not spacious or memorable. At this low season stay, we still had to pay a AAA rate of $160 and pony up an extra $8 parking fee (for the priviledge of parking in one of several hundred unsused spaces in a cavernous parking lot) as well as a $11+ resort fee (were told to pay for groundskeeping costs). All in all, this single night stay (and playing the full 27 holes of golf) was fine and dandy, but it doesn't beckon to me to pay a return visit."

"Review_11049","hotel_104","hotel_3267","Sep 30, 2008","Always a 5 star stay! Its always a good trip when you stay at the Ponce Hilton in Ponce Puerto Rico. I just spent 4 days and 3 nights at this facility and as usual I found it clean, the staff extremely friendly, and there was nothing you could need that was not available. Granted this is a 5 star resort, so if your looking for a bare bones cheap stay this is not the place. But if you want to be catered to, have the staff not only know who you are but be able to address you by name. If you want every possible type of food in what ever amount you want at a moments notice. If you want immediate access to 5 restaurants and 7 bars, a business center and an executive lounge. If you want full service spa's, training areas, casinos, night clubs, etc. then this is the place for you! If this sound like your kind of place the run, don't walk to the Costa Caribe Ponce Hilton."
"Review_11050","hotel_104","hotel_5419","Aug 29, 2008","Loved It! The hotel is beautiful with spectacular views. Staff are friendly and kind. I've seen remarks written about the double beds and it is true. Double beds not much larger than a single. Our room was right off the pool and feet from the beach. Retrieving the car was simple and quick. The breakfast was great. I would definitely come back. The only major thing we had a problem with but through no fault of the hotel was the putrid smell from the Don Q rum factory. It's enough to make you upchuck. Other than that - GREAT TIME. Check in/Check out - 123."
"Review_11051","hotel_104","hotel_1141","Jul 28, 2008","Executive Tower the Best Bet This hotel is the best in town. And the best deal is to be upgraded to the Executive Tower -- which gives you access to the lounge with (2) computers (free) to check email, continental breakfasts, afternoon snacks, cold drinks, tea/coffee, and at 5:30 pm small sandwiches and crudites, at 7:30 desert and liquers. In the evening, the honor bar is quite reasonable -- $5 for a glass of wine. You could make some of your meals here from the snacks and certainly save on expensive sodas, etc etc. Plus the concierge person manning the desk there can assist with tourist info, restaurants, etc. etc. The hotel isn't perfect -- it took 2 days to find out about the valet parking set up -- we were stopping at the desk each time to get our ticket stamped. Nothing was actually every explained to us about their faciities or various options. We had to explore and learn on our own. And if you are with a family -- keep in mind that their double beds are barely larger than a single; okay for very small kids only.That being said -- the main pool is the one for families and children. If you are an older (or romantic) couple and wish a bit less noise, you can take the shuttle (from the front of the hotel) to the country club and use their hot tub and pool. They will ask you to register at the hut where you get your towels (and you're given a wrist band to wear) but during the day the place is so much calmer. At either location there is a very small black sand beach...nothing to write home about ; it might entertain you for a very short walk to find some shells or old pieces of polished glass but not to sit on (although there are a few chairs at each). Keep in mind that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for the shuttle to ever show up -- there's no set schedule.We only ate a couple meals at the hotel -- one lunch at the pool bar -- decent. Had the chicken fingers which came with fries (only $12) from the appetizer list. Sodas were around $3 each. The other meal we had was at the Sushi restaurant (not open everyday) at the country club part. This was just okay. A bit disappointing with limited selections but good for a change from fried foods and mofongos..and yes, expensive for the portions served. For kids -- there is the pool as mentioned, a playground area near the beach, and a small arcade area inside that was kept quite busy. For adults -- there is entertainment advertised on the weekends. Wasn't there then so no idea whether this is worth it or not. The casino is small but decent. Had variety of slots/machines and games. Wasn't very crowded or busy when we were there.The fitness room -- is decently equipped. Has the usual machines and is conveniently located near the main pool. You must be 18 to use machines.They have a spa/sauna == saw their signs but never had a chance to investigate.Did the two hour city tour (only one now available); you can drive up to see several other sites (may be next time) but didn't have the car at the time. Cab from downtown only cost $10 plus tip to Hilton. People at hotel basically quite friendly and helpful. Material distributed not always up to date, however, so do call (or have them call for you).Directions -- As in all of Puerto Rico, directions are horrible and not very accurate (even the Garmin GPS was off). You will be told go right and it's a left and vice versa. Allow yourself time to get anywhere you are going if this is the first time you're there. Many streets are not marked (signs are down or names change as you drive) plus there is a lot of construction on Rte 2 heading west towards Mayaguez (if going to Pitos restaurant -- recommended by the way)"

The room was immaculate, the sheets  bedspreads (which I'm very picky about) were plush, soft, super clean, no complaints about that. The room itself, when I first walked in, smelled deodorized  properly kept.The pool area was beautiful, the terrace with the colossal columns  dangling lights contributes to a feel of tropical elegance. Gym was OK, but would like them to add more treadmills. But the crown of our stay was the Rest La Cava. As soon as we walked in, the services just outstanding. The waiter  host were professional and proper, yet friendly. They were about to close the restaurant, but decided to cater to us regardless. We contemplated the bottles of wines (and the price tags) of wines from all over the world. The food was fresh, and elegantly served. The souffle for dessert, I still crave to this day its delicious grand manier flavor. Would definitely go back! My husband, my boys (teenagers) really enjoyed the stay and would definitely go back."

The bartenders (yes all of them) at the sports bar by the pool have a serious bad attitude but they can make a awesome Pina Colada. The resort could use a remodel. It is dated. The staff at the front desk is friendly. The rooms are okay, definitely not U.S. standards for cleanliness. The fine dining restaurant is expensive but very romantic and has good food. There is nothing in Ponce to do. We went to the boardwalk marina area but it was boring. No shops or restaurants. Just a bunch of bars that were the size of a tool shed. I would not go back to this resort."

When i came back to the desk to explain it took almost 2 hours to correct the problem, which they said was now 3 rooms in the executive tower. But they didn't mention that one room had a murphy bed with no blankets! ahh. The beach here is almost not swim worthy. It is black sand and covered in rocks. The pool is WAY overcrowded. Basically, if you want to stay in a hilton, stay at Hilton Caribe in San Juan. EVERYTHING is better there."

"Review_11059","hotel_104","hotel_3194","Jun 14, 2008","Excellent Staff, Nice Hotel, Not Activities Destination My husband and I booked this trip as a graduation present for my nephew. We selected Ponce, due to its location on the Caribbean side of Puerto Rico. Overall, the hotel was clean, the staff was extremely accommodating, and we enjoyed our 6 day stay. It wasn't perfect in all respects, but setting proper expectations for the ages and interests of those in your travel party could help when deciding on this property. Below is a recap of our experiences.Staff- Excellent. Upon arrival, we were given a standard room in the Executive Tower. (2 double beds and a single person sofa bed -all in one room) for my husband and me and two 18 year olds teens. We booked a two room suite, so this was unacceptable. After much hard work from Rose Maria Alvarez, the hotel day supervisor, she rectified our situation and we were given side by side rooms. Kudos to her for recognizing the importance of honoring reservations, providing good customer service, and maintaining the loyalty of a Gold Hilton Honors member. We were also impressed by the valet staff that drove us to the Golf club each day, and the activities staff member at the club who helped us push our kayaks (and assist my nephew in getting back in).Food and Accommodation - Stay in the executive tower if you can. It is newer, and you have access to the Executive lounge. A continental breakfast was free each day, and they also had free drinks while you were in the lounge (sodas, waters, juices, etc.) The food at the hotel is average at best. Bar food at the pools, or two buffets (one at the hotel and one at the golf club). For lunch, the buffets are $22. We purchased a buffet discount coupon booklet that provided 10 lunch buffets @ $13 a piece. We would check out the items on the hotel buffet first and then decide if we wanted to ride over to the Golf Club buffet for another option. In general, the food and the view are better at the Golf club. RENT A CAR! We did, and ate dinner out near the mall in Ponce each night. It is about 5 miles away, but you'll want to leave the property as there is nothing else to do around the hotel. While there is a mini mart and gift shop on the property, we bought snacks, soda and water at a store near the mall. The rooms had refrigerators, and with sodas at $2.25 a pop at the hotel, you'll save some money.Activities - My husband and I planned to dive using a shop in Ponce and a shop in Guanica. Unfortunately, not enough divers for EITHER shop to go out, so no diving for us the entire week. This was extremely disappointing and bizarre for the Caribbean. My husband played golf at the resort on 2 days. I spent most of my time at the Golf club pool and beach, which is much nicer and quieter than the hotel pool and beach. Despite being on the Caribbean side of PR, the water is not crystal blue as you would typically expect if you've been to other Caribbean destinations. Sand is brown/gray. Not great, but ok. We also used the fitness center which has old equipment, but has everything you need from machines to free weights. In short, this was a relaxing break from work, but not the dive trip we had hoped for.The 18 year olds in our party struggled a bit. While there was tennis, basketball, table tennis, and the pools, they became somewhat bored after a few days. There are no planned activities (like volleyball games and other activities that you typically find at beach resorts). There seemed to be a lot of locals there that were part of a summer club and weren't too accepting of the guests. With nothing around the hotel to do either, they relaxed a lot. :)Despite this, we are not too hard to please and enjoyed the time away. I hope this information helps those reading to determine if this is the best setting for you. At the end of the day, the hotel was clean, offered good amenities, and is the right choice for those wanting to simply get away and relax."

The hotel staff was very friendly. The room was very large and clean. The king size bed was very comfortable. I would recommend staying in the Executive Towers because you have access to a continental breakfast and the Internet in the executive lounge. I highly recommend eating at Sancho's Sushi at the hotel. They have the best sushi and the service was awesome! Definitely rent a car when staying in Puerto Rico. There are so many beautiful beaches around the country within several miles. There are tolls on some of the roads so make sure you have quarters. Driving is simple as long as you stay on the main highways. Once you start getting off the main highways the roads are very narrow and scary. Puerto Rico is a beautiful country."

"Review_11064","hotel_104","hotel_7852","Jan 29, 2008","Had a Fabulous time We had a great time at this resort. There is so much to do at the resort that we only went into town twice. Once to see the historic square and once for dinner. We had an ocean view room on the third floor of one of the executive towers. The day we checked in, the hotel was so uncrowded that we wonder how the stay open. We are glad they do. Our room was large and spotlessly clean. The view from our balcony of the ocean was as good as any I've seen anywhere. We were on a golf package and played the Caribe Country Club for three days. If you think the hotel is uncrowded, you should see the golf course. One day we started at 9:00 a.m. and we were the only two people on the course for the first hour. The course are in very nice condition and enjoyable to play. The only drawbacks to this property are the pool, which is basically a kiddies pool and the price of the food. Portions are plentiful (too large actually) and the quality is good but the prics are a bit high. Fortunately, it is a short cab ride or drive into town to get some excellent seafood at more reasonable prices. Bottom line is we enjoyed ourselves so much, we are considering a week at this resort in the future."

The hotel has lovely gardens with fish, ducks, and turtles -- great for entertaining the kiddo. The pool is small but nice, and is saltwater. Because we were here for one night only, we didn't have time to enjoy a lot of the other amenities the hotel offers. If you're not into gambling, don't let the casino scare you. We didn't even know where it was until we were checking out. Unlike Las Vegas, the casino is behind double doors with a small sign, so it's easy to avoid. Our only complaint was that the hair dryer in the bathroom didn't work well, but it wasn't a big deal. Just a warning when traveling to Ponce -- nothing about the hotel here, but it is a buggy place. This was our second trip to the town (first to the Hilton) and both times, the bugs ate us up. Take lots of bug spray."

This was the only place we could find with availability (even a month in advance). We were pleasantly surprised. The lobby was large and clean and the front desk personnel were helpful and friendly. We thought the room was modern and clean, and had a small fridge. Our room was ocean/pool view on the first level and we loved being able to walk right out to the beach. The hotel hosted a corporate family day on our last day and set up a huge tent almost right in front of our room. The crew was noisy constructing the tents, so we contacted the front desk and they offered a different room with a worse view, so we stayed. The pool was very small but clean with lots of kids around. We appreciated that the hottub stayed open all night. The sports bar by the pool served good (strong) drinks and good bar-type food. The lobby bar could be loud at night with the entertainment, The beach was windy and the sand was gray -- not overly exciting. We took the free shuttle over to the Costa Caribe Golf Resort pool one day -- they had a much larger and prettier pool, better chairs with umbrellas, decent beach, better poolside bar and slightly larger food menu, and a fabulous view of the golf course and mountains. It's worth it to go use that pool. Overall, we had a great weekend and were comfortable. It's a typical nice large resort. Staff was nice and the hotel was clean. We would go back there again!"

Though I agree that it can be quite noisy, but it all adds to the atmosphere and we had no trouble sleeping. One thing to add though about noise is the rumbling you can hear late into the night which is the metro passing by the hotel!!We didnt take the breakfast option and found a wonderful tapas bar.

The location of the hotel (on the nicer part of La Ramba) is very convenient, and as we had a room overlooking the courtyard, there was no problem with noise. Breakfast each morning had a large selection, including some hot foods (eggs, omlettes), and it was served outside in the charming garden. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."

The location can't be beat, right on the Rambla, a two minute walk to the central square where buses leave for the AP every ten minutes or so. The room we were in faced onto the Courtyard, which we requested because it was so quiet. The rooms opening out to the Rambla are great for atmosphere, but believe me, Barcelona folk don't go to sleep at night, and the street noise is considerable. The room we were in was very well appointed, the bathroom great. The TV was minimal, to say the least, but it did bring in Sky News, and we weren't in the room that long, anyway. The breakfast was included in our deal, and was excellent. Not worth $30 bucks apiece, if we were paying extra for it, but what breakfast is? If breakfast is not included in your deal, there are lots of cheaper eating places around. BUT, Barcelona is expensive. I confess we ate at the McDonalds on the Rambla one evening, a McDonalds fish sandwich, fries and a coke, and the tab was $9 bucks APIECE. But this is a vote for the Rivoli Rambla, with a special note about the friendliness of the woman on the front desk."

It should be noted that there are two wings in the hotel, the modern wing and the traditional wing - I strongly suggest you opt for the modern rooms as traditional appeared to be a flowery way of saying in need of a refurb!You are right in the heart of it all here, with the infamous Las Ramblas on your doorstep - thus quality restuarants, bars and great shopping are never more than a stones throw away.Highly recommended for a short city break."

The room was ready on arrival and was very large with a huge balcony with table and chairs. The bathroom was also very big. The room was clean and had everything we needed. However, I did think that it was rather expensive at 120 euros per night, although I suppose you have to remember that this is in a city on the main street in Barcelona. The location was excellent - right on la Ramblas, so everything was nearby. The room was cleaned daily. We did not eat at the hotel as there as so many places to choose from nearby. We did get a coffee in the bar just before we were leaving and I must say that the bar man was incredibly rude - didn't say one word to us at all. The receptionists were helpful and friendly and spoke excellent English, which always helps when your Spanish is not great!!All in all, a good choice of hotel with a perfect location that is paid for with the room rates."

WiFi is free, but signal is very weak. so sometimes you cannot make a connection. most of the staff cannot even answer the most simplest of question or request. breakfast is ok but nothing great. even their scrambled eggs taste bad.all i can say is that they serve good coffee for breakfast."

The room was great,i t wasnt huge but three people managed to stay init, for 3 nights and not fall out!! However the bathroom wasl one of the nicest ive ever seen, water was hot and shower very powerfull, so what more do you need.The location is fantastic literally 2 minutes walk from plaza catalunya, it did make it quite loud at night and in the mornin but not too much to keep you awake, unless you are a light sleeper!!To round up, if you want a great hotel at a great price, choose the rivoli ramblas, im definately going to again!"

I didnt eat anything in the hotel so cant comment on the food. Only negative point is that the toilet door in our room (and the room our friends were in) were on runners rather than hinges meaning a lack of privacy noise wise - which is no good if you are shy!!Barcelona is a great city but just a word of warning if you fancy going there for New Years Eve - it got a bit wild late at night on New Years Eve on La Ramblas (at one point just outside our hotel) and the police were there using their batons to control the drunken behaviour that was going on. Quite scary to watch and we were pleased to be safe inside our hotel whilst it was going on. So not really a place to take your kids if you plan on stopping out late on a New Years Eve to see the new year in. It did calm down after a while so we went back out to continue our new year celebrations and had a good night.One other thing to note is that having become so accustomed to the smoking ban indoors in the UK it was hard (as a non-smoker) to go back to sitting in restaurants and pubs with people smoking right next to you."

The staff aren't very friendly but we found that staff in general in Barcelona aren't very friendly.The rooms are very spacious and the bed was really comfy. We chose to have a room at the front of the hotel and our room overlooked Las Ramblas. It was great to sit there in the morning watching the world pass by and the street entertainers setting up for the day, but it could be quite noisy at night as the bin men come round about midnight.The breakfast was really nice and loads of choice ranging from breads, pastries, cold meats, fresh fruit and juices but the hot food wasn't up to much and could be sat in the hot well for up to 4 hours.If you're planning a drinking weekend then make sure you take loads of money you can't get 2 drinks for less than 10 Euros.

Using the English hotel rating I would say 2/3 with a 3 star maximum. We were lucky to get a bigger room as the hotel wasn鈥檛 busy so think they swopped our room with a more spacious disabled room on the 2nd floor. Walking past all the other rooms being cleaned we noticed they were small and badly decorated. Room was clean, although furnishings a little tired, but the bathroom smelt musty like it had no ventilation or had not been used for months. A scented candle in the room sorted this out though. The beds were comfortable and rooms facing las ramblas are fairly noisy, so this will be worse in the height of summer. No tea/coffee facilities which meant you had to order drinks on room service which shut at 11pm. Reception staff were not very helpful and one was even asleep at the desk when we got in at midnight! My mine gripe was wanting to use the 鈥渇itness centre鈥? We were told no problem and they needed 3 hrs notice to heat the Jacuzzi. This was fine but when we got there the Jacuzzi was lukewarm and the fitness centre was just one cross trainer. Then they told me this would be 鈧?5 extra each as all guests pay for the centre. I think they get their 4 star out of providing fitness facilities, but one cross trainer does not a fitness centre make! All in all, it was ok, not great, but perfect location meant you could see past all the little things. Doubtful I would stay here again when there are other decent places."

"Review_11082","hotel_105","hotel_6125","Jan 20, 2008","Good as a base for your trip Firstly, as a base for a holiday the location was absolutely perfect. So close to everything..... metro, sightseeing bus tour, La Rambla walk itself and the marina. While during the daytime once on your guard you could ramble around the wonderful little side streets surrounding the hotel at night time it was somewhere very different. Watch your belongings, unfortunately as we learned pick pocketing was rife. The rooms in the hotel were clean (rooms cleaned daily) but basic. One Big Big fault was no tea coffee making facilities in the room. Room service ended at 11pm so if you were thirsty after that - TOUGH. Noise level was high, put it this way - there was no need to set your alarm, the cleaners made sure of that. Banging and vaccuming from the early hours, and the cardboard walls could do with some noise insulation, if not for quiet then just for privacy.Don't be attracted by the gym, sauna etc facilities either, booking three hours in advance was a requisition, however, the solarium was a sun lounger on the terrace not an actual sunbed.Overall, I would stay again purely for convenient location only, if the hospitality/ basic facilities was better the hotel would be rated much higher in our estimation."

Renovated building, nice bar and restaurant, all kinds of stores, bars, restaurants, places of interest and metro station within 5 minutes walk. Everything you expect from a downtown central hotel. I would not advise it for women travelling alone, the area might make you feel just a little bit uncomfortable after dark, bag snatchers everywhere. Rooms, service and breakfast of ligh standards. If you are going to stay there, ask for an upper-floor room and at the back. Soundproofing is not so good - you can actually hear the next-door guest breething."

There was a very noisy air extraction fan (which ran intermittently day and night) from the kitchen on the floor below.

Turns out it was a fine choice for other reasons, too. It's a charming old building at the epicenter of old Seattle, as the name implies. My morning walk took me to Pioneer Square itself and to the Seattle city hall, both within three blocks. The docks and Puget Sound are a block away, and it's an easy walk to Pike Street Market. Rooms are big and nicely renovated. Ours had a balcony on the street with a lovely view of a full moon, though I know they can't always provide that.

Comfortable rooms and bathroom, if oddly shaped and not very large, which were fine for a short stay. The breakfasts are limited but acceptable and the breakfast room is enlivened by the sight of fellow guests attempting to work out the waffle maker. Pleasant staff and reception, apparantly family run and up to the usual Best Western standards, clean and well appointed.Several restaurants nearby but we suggest avoiding the closest, al Boccalino, a rather pretentious but unexceptional Italian 3 or 4 doors away. Expensive for what you get; we were told very offhandedly that they had no Washington wines. We are an Italian restaurant!

The room decor is very well done - down to the drapery, carpet and nice artwork on the walls. The bathrooms are modern and nicely sized. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms and bathrooms were spotless. The linens were fresh and spotless as well. The fresh fruit and free bottled water was a nice touch and very much appreciated. The breakfast room was clean and always stocked with the daily offerings. The coffee was good and the waffles were addicting. Even the elevator was fast and roomy. You don't realize how much you appreciate that until you go to another hotel where the elevators are sloooooow and tiny (as they were in our Victoria BC hotel). The Pioneer Square area is lively and exciting with lots of little shops and restaurants. We walked around the area at night and didn't feel unsafe. Other people mentioned street people as problematic. This is a fact of life in any large city, but none of the street people were aggressive or abusive. Just a block away, they offer a tour of Seattle Underground which was interesting. Pizza at Mario's was delicious. Dinner at Elliott's Oyster House at Pier 56 was wonderful.

Yesler Way where this hotel is location is on the original skid row. This was orginally a muddy road that logs were dragged (skidded) up to get to Yesler's mill. Thus, the term skid row was was given to this area. Loggers and millworkers being lonely at times liked to frequent the business that sprung up around this area. They also got a bit thirsty!!! I previously lived in Seattle for about 15 years. I rode or walked by the hotel several times and never gave it a thought. Was looking for a hotel close to the train station, by the bus stop, and close to the waterfront. You step out the door of the hotel and turn left walk about a block and your at the ferry terminal on the waterfront. You walk out the hotel door and practically next door is the bus stop for FREE bus service within the Downtown core. The Klondike Gold Rush museum is also in the area. They sometimes offer free walking tours that include a trip to the top of the Smith Tower (originally the tallest building on the West Coast). If you walk north up 1st Ave about 6-7 blocks  at the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) and the Pike Place Market. The rooms were small, but the hotel was built in the early 1900. The room was immaculate, and because of something we were given an upgrade to a deluxe room with city view. We got in about 9pm and walked to the waterfront. Ivars is open until late. We found a really good deal. They extend their Happy Hour on Fridays til closing. Well drinks, wine are $3.00. Limited menu but I got fried oysters for $4.95, can get Fish  chips also for 4.95 with view table looking out as the ferry terminal.

(I used my AAA rate) so I guess you are restricted only on certain block of rooms. That's fine but when I got in the room, the place was smelling so badly of food perhaps from the previous guest. So the windows were wide open obviously to get rid of the smell. Needless to say, it was freezing and damp since it was still raining (it was in early June). I checked back downstairs and complained. She still hesitated to move me to another room. Extremely unfriendly staff. Breakfast was OK, and I heard a guest comment that he had been staying there for years butthat the hotel had really gone downhill in terms of standards. The hallways could use a bit of an uplift and should be cleaned I will not recommend this hotel at all.The only good thing is that they use environmental friendly products in their bathrooms."

This Best Western is really an exception--fantastic view of the Space Needle from my window, spacious and exceedingly clean rooms, warm and responsive desk staff. Plus the committment to Greensuites is impressive.It's a few blocks away from Belltown so there isn't much happening in the immediate vicinity except for construction. Seems kind of deserted at night so I don't know if I'd walk around there alone at night, but hey, it's Seattle and people drive."
"Review_11124","hotel_107","hotel_7722","May 15, 2008","Surprisingly decent I almost didnt book based on a couple of the reviews but I decided to chance it and I am glad I did. The hotel is a bit dated on the exterior and the neighborhood is undergoing a bit of much needed regentrification. I never felt unsafe but I can see why those unfamilar with the urban setting may be. While there were some street people about they arent aggressive and there are enough regular folk walking around that I wouldnt hesitate to put my 72 year old mother in the neighborhood.  The location is excellent! Read that again, Excellent. there are hundreds of restaurants all within about a 10-15 minute walk. I absolutely LOVE walking around in a vibrant downtoan urban setting and this area makes me want to trade in my suburban ranch for a loft. I tried the Spitfire on 4th and Bell and the Frontier room on 1st and Blanchard. Spitfire is southwest spicy sandwiches and salads and Frontier is excellent BBQ, not KC but very good smoked meats, ribs and sandwiches. The Space needle is around the corner, get an even numbered room for a view, otheriwise the view is just cityscape. The room was clean and while a bit bland served it purpose well. The bed was comfy and there was a fridge and micro. The bathroom is on the smallish side but the water pressure was great. The room is completely 'green' with low impact features which I would expect in Seattle.  The staff was very friendly, that famous northwest hospitality very evident. I would skip the restaurant in the lobby as it seems to be very basic hotel fare and since there are literally hundreds of great options so very close.  The hotel charges $15 a night for parking and while that is a huge pet peeve of mine I was aware of it going in and it only annoyed me to the point of mentioning it here. Really, tack on $20 to the price of the room and get rid of the charge, its silly.  With hotel prices rising rapidly in the past couple of years, this place gives a great experience at a reasonable rate. The place I stayed last year went from $140/night to $275, so at $130, this place is a steal and if you are expecting the W this aint it. If you want a clean, convenient, friendly, reasonable place to stay, you wouldnt do much better."

We needed a central location for Seattle Center/UW/Qwest Field. Parking was $15 per night, reasonable for Seattle standards and as a Crown Club Member, our parking was front door center... we also got to leave our car for the day we checked out. First impression always is the front desk, we were met with friendly smiles and excellent service from start to finish. I spend about 40 nights a year in hotels and this was the best customer service i've experienced in years. Upon checkout we received perfect directions to the location we were headed on foot. The location was perfectly convenient, the room was nice sized, clean, and enjoyable. Free high speed internet was a plus. We enjoyed our view of the Space Needle and the Seattle center carousel. Especially convenient was the location going back and forth to Seattle Center, getting downtown, Pike's Place, etc. Hands down our new place to stay in Seattle."
"Review_11128","hotel_107","hotel_9910","Apr 15, 2008","No respect for teenagers My Son arrived only to find that they would not rent a room to him. Just because he did not hold a credit card, even though he had permission to use his parents, and we called to verify. We were told this could only be arranged during office hours. It was now late, office hours were over, I would have thought that the manager could make the decision. But he told me NO. They had nowhere else to go. The manager suggested a grungy hotel down the road. They had cash, and our credit card and we even talked to the manager, but he told us he could not make any exceptions, as this would be discrimination. I think that it is discrimination to the teenagers, as they would not rent to them with our approval, written or verbal. I can make purchases online, but somehow I could not even place my credit card as security for the price of the room and other expenses. Some policies are too strict and some exceptions should always be allowed. I spoke to Best Western head office and they told me that all Best Westerns were individually owned and operated, therefore the policy was only with this one hotel. So why couldn't the rule be bent a little? It wasn't alot to ask for. Let the decent kids have a good place to stay, no you treat them like scum and you wonder why our kids are the way they are today. WOW !!!!!!!! So if you decide to stay here, beware of policies."

Third time we've stayed and they've increased in our esteem again! This BW caters to the business crowd, but we've always stayed for leisure (usually on a weekend). For the rate, it's perfect. Clean, green, and if you request  it's available: a drop-dead view of the Space Needle practically across the street. (Ask again at check-in to make sure.) A mere walk to Belltown (about 5 short blocks) where too many choices of restaurants, wine (and spirits) bars, younger folks clubs (live music, pubs, etc), jazz clubs --if weather permits, a nice hoof over to even Pike's! You don't get the usual BW complimentary continental breakfast buffet, but b/c rates are lower we splurge on breakfast via room service. Parking's free in lower locked parking, which has cameras so we felt cool leaving our many shopping finds from this great shopping city discretely tucked away in back of our SUV. Check them out, for the money they're not long for best kept secret status too much longer. Kudos to the staff and management of this property; well done!"

My boyfriend and I came to visit Seattle for the first time this year, we stayed for 4 days/3nights and since I knew we were going to be out of the hotel the majority of our days with sightseeing I decided to book a room here. Best decision I ever made!!My pros:- Everything is within walking distance (Space Needle is practically in your backyard, Belltown with all the restaurants, bars, and clubs is just a few blocks down the street and the Pike Place market is about a 10 minute walk away or you can hop on a bus to go deeper downtown, etc)- Rooms are clean.- Heater worked really well- They have room service, and their staff of servers are pretty considerate and nice- FREE wireless internet service and it's fast!- Room service called us to ask if we needed new towels or anything else.- My boyfriend bought fish at Pike's Market, which was delivered to this hotel. They were nice enough to store it in their restaurant freezer for us free of charge!Some cons:- You have to pay for parking- The hallways kind of scared me upon getting off the elevator because it seemed pretty dingy (they need to do some steam cleaning or something - I would not want to walk around on bare feet!)- The construction zone next to the hotel might worry people but seriously, we didn't hear any of that noise through the walls or anything in the morning.- The people at the front desk can be a little nicer but that really wasn't a big deal to us.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of its location. You can pretty much see almost everything there is to see in Seattle (or at least the best places if not everything) if you stay here and you wouldn't even need a car!"

"Review_11134","hotel_107","hotel_7386","Feb 13, 2008","Decent Services, Dreadful Smell I was happy with the fact that their wireless was free, they had good cable channels (Comedy Central), and the room was quite spacious (although I did have a handicapped room so I don't know if they're all that way). I appreciated the refrigerator that functioned as a normal refrigerator, not an overpriced minibar, so I could keep my leftover dinner in there for lunch without worrying about getting stuck with a charge for opening the minibar.In general, the appointments were better than you'd get in a top hotel -- in a top hotel in Seattle you'd have a much smaller room, wireless would cost $20/night, and you still wouldn't get Comedy Central. Parking was expensive -- $15/night -- but you can park on the street for free with no problem. I had one major qualm with this motel, and that was that my non-smoking room was by no means truly smoke-free. You can't take a room that has been smoked in for 30 years, spray it with some sort of chemical that's supposed to neutralize the air, plop a no smoking sign down on the dresser, and call it a non-smoking room. After 5 minutes in the room, it was clear that it had been smoked in for years, and within an hour, my throat was raw and my eyes were burning from the residual smoke and chemicals. And I'm not all that sensitive to smoke, having grown up with a parent who was a smoker. The smoking issue is too bad -- because otherwise this motel is a good value for the price."

Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Monorail is only a block away (right beside the Space Needle). A round trip ticket is only $4 and besides just being plain cool, it takes you directly to the downtown shopping district, so if you want you can leave your car at the hotel for the day. Fantastic Mexican restaurant, Azteca, about a 5-minute drive away. Excellent breakfast at the 5 Point Cafe just a couple blocks away... best pancakes I've ever eaten! We had a striking view of the Space Needle right outside our window, which was pretty neat. If you're in Seattle to tour, they also have a huge selection of tourist brochures for various activities in their lobby, which is very handy. All in all, we had an excellent experience here, and will definitely be staying here again on our next visit to Seattle!"

The room was large and clean, but clearly looked like an older property that went through a makeover, with some key areas not updated (hallways and lobby).The location is very convenient, just of I10 with a McDonalds restaurant in front and other restaurants close by. The hotel has a bar also. Ask to stay at the mountain side of the hotel instead of the highway side. I stayed on the highway side and the road noise from I10 was rather distracting (I like to sleep with open windows - there is no noise with the windows closed).This isn't the level of property I like to stay in, but the friendly staff, convenient location and price point makes up for some of the short comings."

Very helpful.The bad.Seemed like it could have a nice cleaning.Our room was somehow connected to another room (which we didn't want or realize at first. Our first night there no one was in the room next to us, but the next night people were there).That it made it very uncomfortable when we could hear and see the shadows of the peoples feet next to us under the door. It's a good thing they weren't doing anything, (at least we couldn't hear) uggghhh! otherwise we would have asked to switch rooms immediately. They shouldn't give you suites unless you actually pay for that, otherwise it makes for uncomfortable situations.Overall, probably wouldn't stay there again, because there are so many other options in the Phoenix area, but for our experience it was fun and were glad we picked it."
"Review_11139","hotel_108","hotel_3294","Apr 24, 2008","Grace Inn I attended a conference at the Best Western Grace Inn and Conference Center at Ahwatukee in Phonix last week. First, the good parts...The public areas at the hotel were really quite nice, and the conference rooms had the unique feature of opening on to the pool/patio area. With absolutely fabulous weather, we had those doors open all day and night, and it was such a nice departure from the usual, closed in, conference atmosphere. The pool area was quite nice and it looked like the restroom in the lobby had been recently remodeled.Now for the not so good...The rooms needed some updating BADLY. It was a sparcely furnished, huge room with a flat, planklike bed, a small sofa and a chair, a desk and a TV cabinet, and even with all of that in there, the place seemed cavernously empty. Old, OLD drapes and bedspread, and in that whole humongous room, one teeny little picture on the wall made it look uncomfortably spartan. The whole room slanted towards one wall, and one morning when I opened up my drapes a bit past the window, I found a huge crack in the wall. Seems like the whole place is on it's way to toppling!My friends had a room that slanted even more than mine... one of them had trouble staying on her bed without sliding out.Another friend had a shower head that was hanging off the wall.On arrival, the main elevators in the lobby weren't working and it took most of the next day for them to be fixed... so we had to use the freight elevator to get our stuff up to our rooms.The restaurant takes the prize for the world's worst breakfast buffet and service. One morning I sat there for 20 minutes and no one even came around for a drink order. No coffee... thank heavens I was able to scrounge some up at the conference.If you're attending a conference, there really isn't too much in the way of lodging close by... there's a hotel accross the highway, but it's a very busy highway, sort of like a freeway, actually, so it wouldn't really be convenient to stay elsewhere. There are, however, several restaurants within walking distance. If it's not your vacation, you can tough it out for a couple of nights for a conference... but if you're considering this place for a vacation - I'd stay elsewhere!"

Hotel is clean, but showing its age, and has some minor maintenance issues. For example the bathroom exhaust fan only worked intermittently, and looked like it was going to fall out of the ceiling. It took several minutes (5+) to get hot water on the 5th floor. Most mornings the shower was cold. The hotel staff, although friendly and helpful, seemed in denial that we could possibly have problems with hot water. They did agree to turn it up and we finally had our hottest shower on the last day. For some reason housekeeping shorted us on towels and coffiee packets on occasion.We had a one-bedroom suite, which was very nice considering we were travelling with a 1-year old. He had his own room, and the curtains were very dark so he could nap during the day. They advertise complimentary cribs when available, although they tried to tell me it was $10 a day when I called them directly to make the reservation. The sheet provided with the crib was not fitted, but was just a folded, full-size flat sheet. Fortunately, we brought our own fitted crib sheet which worked much better.The hotel advertises complimentary high-speed Internet, but that really meant free wifi in public areas of the hotel only, and some rooms had wired connections. Our room did not have a wired Internet connection, but since it overlooked the pool area, we were able to get intermittent wifi connections.Some rooms come with complimentary breakfast for two. Ours did not, since we received a discounted rate. However, there is a McDonad's within walking distance next door, and a Safeway and several restaurants nearby."

I am familiar with this hotel as my family lives down the street and we have had relatives stay there previously. Checked in at 1:00a and the front desk clerk was sleeping. When he woke up he was very helpful. Room was on the 2nd floor and there are no lifts. Plenty of parkingThe room was very nice and in good condition and the bed was very comfortable. The wireless worked. There is wired in the wall if you need it. Single cup coffee maker, micro, fridge, hairdryer. Towels are not abundant here. You usually get 2 bath, 2 hand, and 1 washcloth. On some days the maid would do pretty designs with the towels, Kleenex and TP. No smoky smell in this room. We had some toilet issues and they were right on it. It was never totally repaired but it was bearable. There is a gap under the door so if you are light sensitive put something down there. The breakfast and social room is near the lobby and is definitely showing some wear. The breaky food was good and there was plenty of it. It would be nice if they rotated some items for variety. If they are having a meeting they block off half the room so seating can get scarce. A lot of people would take food back to their rooms. Social reception from 5-630p daily with wine, beer, soft drinks, popcorn and chips. The pool was in constant use during the day and some people were using the BBQ. There is a vending area with a couple of washer and dryers and pop/snack machines. The hotel is an acceptable drive to the airport but there are many closer if you need that. There is good pub grub at Gallagher鈥檚 down 16th and for Mexican at Ajo Al鈥檚 further south. Fresh and Easy market at 12th and Northern and a Safeway at 7th and Glendale.

Our particular room sat right on the road, and it was noisy ALL NIGHT! The staff was nice, and allowed us to hang out in the breakfast eating area most of the night playing some no-money poker.

Despite booking the hotel on-line well in advance I got two different rates $116 for the first night, $152 for the second + tax. I'd say that the first rate is closer to the real value of the room - we debated looking for another less expensive hotel for the last night and canceling the second reservation but didn't want to go through the hassle, especially since we were traveling with a baby.What you get for your money - convenient location close to I51 but not close enough to hear the traffic. Easy 30 minute drive to the airport or car rental drop off. Good quality, clean rooms, comfortable beds, excellent breakfast (already described in detail in other reviews). Good area.We were upgraded on our first night to a two room suite (because they were overbooked) which came equipped with two washrooms (one wheelchair accessible), flat screen tvs, fold out couch bed. Very nicely done. Only complaint would be that the view was the stairwell heading up to the second floor and several mattresses that were being stored(?) there. On our second night we had a standard room with a single king bed - also very nice (but not worth the extra $40 we paid). We overlooked the pool and the jacuzzi was running all night. Front desk staff were very helpful and had good recommendations for restaurants -you're within walking distance (about 1 mile) from several restaurants - try Carlos O'Brien's. A crib was requested and a playard was provided - mattress too hard for a baby to sleep on."

The room had both refrigerator/microwave.Shower and bathtub were better than average.Continuing with the negatives: no morning newspaper at your door - in fact usually no newspaper on the premises in the late morning, at all. Breakfast room small and usually crowded with no pastries - had to settle for banana/yogurt. Coffeemaker in room was the one-cup-only variety rather than the usual (4-cup) pot. Location of hotel is intersection of two (Northern  16th Street) heavily traveled and noisy roads - ask for a room facing the back of the property. Request for a third bath towel daily was ignored. Registration staff was uninterested.Bottomline: aside from proximity to a convenient freeway, thisfacility has little to offer."

The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The rooms which have ajoining room doors do not offer good sound insulation at all...the ajoining room doors allow light and noise to easily come through. Not good if you are expecting some degree of privacy. With the refreshed decor, I was surprised at the lack of cleanliness throughout the hotel...the carpets in hallways were often dirty and needed vacuuming. The biggest upset of this trip was getting food poisoning from the hotel restaurant (under cooked eggs I believe). I was not the only person to come down with it either. The lobby bar was pleasant. The hotel staff was friendly. I would stay at this hotel again but would insist on a room that did NOT have an ajoining room door."

"Review_11153","hotel_110","hotel_5712","Oct 8, 2008","Ok except one thing I stayed at the Wyndham Phoenix for 4 nights for a conference. The hotel was located about 2 short blocks from the entrance to the convention center, which was convenient. However, other than a few restaurants and the ballparks, there was not a whole lot within walking distance. But I think that is just downtown Phoenix.The good:My room was nice-- the beds were above average but not the super soft and fluffy ones you get in some hotels. I appreciated small adjustable reading lamps on both sides of both beds, and a cushioned window seat to look out at the view from. Free wired internet was nice, but it tended to come in and out, and was in fact down for about half a day while I was there. Bathrooms were nice and spacious with plenty of room to spread out toiletries and such. Slightly odd that there was a free standing closet in the sink area, but no matter. I at at the restaurant one night and it was surprisingly good for a hotel dinner. Starbucks in the lobby is closed on Sunday. Now the bad:Everyone was very nice and friendly when I checked in late at night. I got up to my room on the 16th floor, tired and ready for bed. Unfortunately, I noticed a small cockroach running around on the tile near the door. Yuck! I killed it, but called down and asked to change rooms-- this isn't my walk-up apartment in NYC after all. They were very gracious is changing my room quickly to another on the floor so I wouldn't have to come back down and added a credit for a drink at the bar to my account. Normally, I would just chalk this up to bad luck and not even mention it. However, on my last morning there in the new room, I saw and killed another one! Two cockroaches in 4 days just seemed like too much to be a fluke. Because of this, I would not stay here again."

It was a nice property in downtown Phoenix that was easy to find from the airport--I was traveling solo and had never been to Phoenix. I arrived about 3 pm but traffic was not bad. Valet was efficient. Staff was friendly and room was clean. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was tasty (huge breakfast burrito) but, as others reported, the service was painfully slow despite the fact that there was hardly anyone there. Had a quick lunch at Baja Fresh across the street. Very good. There is a Starbucks next door (for those who want to enjoy hot coffee in the Phoenix heat) Overall, I feel this is a convenient (and seems safe) location for visiting Phoenix for business or pleasure--I could see the US Airways Arena from my room."

The concierge couldn't recommend anywhere for us to get breakfast except the hotel restaurant. The restaurant was virtually empty, yet our service was lousy. Our room was just okay. The lighting in the bathroom was poor, the carpet was worn, and everything just seems kind of dated. For what we paid, we expected much more."

My wife and I are avid Opera and basketball fans. An evening downtown is usually spoiled by the awefull, terrible traffic after a ballgame or other highly attended event. The construction of the light rail system has made things much worse over the past couple of years (and for years to come apparently).Solution?Stay in a downtown hotel for a romantic evening!We have stayed at the Wyndham hotel abot half a dozen time in the past year after enjoying the opera or ballgame. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Large rooms and very comfy beds. Check in and check out is quick and the staff is polite. The food at the hotel is so-so dinnerwise, but breakfast is pretty good. I suggest dinner at Majrle's or Alice Cooper's Town, both within walking distance. Excellent downtown location within easy walking distance to downtown venues. some rooms on upper floors have great views, some rooms on lower floors have aweful views. We always ask for an upper floor with a view to set the romantic atmosphere. My main gripe is the lack of mini refrigerators in the rooms, so we are stuck with filling up the sink with ice to keep perishables cold. you can get good deals on the weekend from the hotel website ($100 ish) as this is mainly a businessman's hotel."

Hotel lobby is lovely, once you get in it-it's not easy to figure out which entrance is the main one or where to valet the car for check-in. We arrived early, because of the mtg, but the reception staff were very helpful  called as soon as the room was ready. The room itself was fine, overall, though the hotel needs to engage in the great 'hotel bed wars'-still using flat bottom sheets that end up in a wadded knot under your back the first time you turn over. Bathroom vanity is VERY low  only had a single sink, though the room had 2 double beds. Only 1 outlet for the sink, which was a problem this morning when trying to plug in the coffee maker, hair dryer,  curling iron @ the same time. Separate room for tub  toilet, but consider yourself warned, if you are in room 1511, bring a flashlight or candles for additional lighting in there-I couldn't believe how dark that room was!! Very nice office chair @ the work space, but the 'desk' is simply an oversized square end table, which was a bit akward. As another reviewer noted, though there is a very large armoire to hold the tv, the tv itself was a 19 inch one that gets lost in that big cabinet. And, it's not on a pull out shelf, so unless you are sitting on the bed, you can't see it, especially from the desk. One nice touch was the fact that the bedroom window actually opened, which was a Godsend when the 'smoke free' hotel A/C system was pouring cigarette smoke into our room (ugh!)"

However, the rooms are severely dated- needed a facelift probably 15 years ago. When we opened the usual cabinet that houses the TV, we were greeted by a set that filled up maybe a third of the space! It was a joke! Still, the rooms were clean and the location was ideal for us. But next time we'll hit the Hyatt across the street."
"Review_11161","hotel_110","hotel_10359","Feb 21, 2008","Typical Downtown Hotel I stayed at the Wyndham for a conference in February 2008. As stated in the other reviews, the lobby is very nice. Check in was fast, no lines. Room provided as promised and arrival fruit and drinks were sent to my room within twenty minutes of my arrival (this is a Wyndham By Request perk). The staff is very friendly and professional. The room was average, nothing special. While it was clean and well appointed, it was pretty small. I stayed on the 14th floor and had no problems with elevator availability. Two things that stuck me as strange. The room had the smallest television I have ever seen in a hotel. Also, the light in the bath area was very dim. The ceiling in the bath was very short and being a tall person, this was a bit discomforting. The beds were adequate, nothing special. Plenty of towels, pillows, bath supplies. The bath area is very cramped. I couldn't see more than one person at a time using the sink area. I ate at Marston's for breakfast once. It was rather underwhelming. $14 for breakfast buffet was typical for a hotel restaurant, but the variety was lacking. I did eat at the conference in the meeting rooms. Fairly good, decent service.The bell desk and front door folks were very helpful. One thing about downtown Phoenix, if you expect nightlife or things to do during the day, lower your expectations. It was tough finding restaurants open and things to do. Unless you have a car, you entertainment choices are limited.Overall, the Wyndham is decent, but nothing special."

The rooms were very large with nice beds, large couch space and terrific service. I stayed at the Wyndham during Super Bowl weekend and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. It's a shame that such a nice venue is located in such a horrendous area. It was my first ever trip to Phoenix and though I had heard that downtown Phoenix wasn't the most hip cities in the world, I was really unprepared for the ghost town that is the city of Phoenix. There is NOTHING around the hotel. It's like a movie set facade. On my trip to the airport I was half expecting to see folks tearing down the set to expose the empty desert. There are large buildings and convention centers but nobody spends any time at any of them Lest you think this was simply the result of the Super Bowl crowd forcing everyone to move to other locations, we spoke with several locals who confirmed that Phoenix is simply dead as a nightlife / restaurant city. I have no idea how those businesses down there can survive. And it's because of this lack of entertainment that I was a little unnerved by my stay at the Wyndham. I guess it's not the Wyndham's fault, necessarily, but while I don't need the area around my hotel to be Times Square or South Beach, I wouldn't mind a decent restaurant or two or maybe a bar. I was just surprised to find myself in a scene from 28 Days Later or I Am Legend."

When we checked out, there was a bill for two visits to the bar. We felt like we had to defend ourselves. The staff checked through all receipts and finally found it w/ a very different signature / printed name than mine (thank goodness we had a the bar receipt when we actually ordered drinks so signatures could be compared).

The noise level is unbelievable if you are put in a room on the side that runs along 44th St. We were on the 4th floor and could not hear the TV over the traffic and drunks. Although the interior is security gated, I really did not know if my car was going to be there in the morning. The noise from the surrounding rooms was horrible. Everytime somebody slammed a door, it made things on the table in our room shake. I realize the hotel cannot do anything about the police helicopter noise while they were searching by spotlight for somebody in our parking lot area, but it sure added to the total ambience of the place. The rooms were clean but worn down looking, the bathroom was exceptionally dinky. The one good thing I can say about this hotel was the front desk staff is especially helpful and nice. Although, the housekeeping staff needs to turn down the mariachi music while they are cleaning the rooms. I always stay at Hilton chains, but will never return to this one."
"Review_11167","hotel_111","hotel_4604","Sep 5, 2008","OK but needs renovation I was looking forward to my first stay in an Embassy Suites facility. I was part of a convention contingent who had been booked into the hotel. The neighborhood is not good and if you do not have a car, you are captive to the hotel without other attractions, dining, etc within safe walking distance. The hotel seems to be about 5 miles from all attractions (down town, Scottsdale, etc) except the airport, which is very close by.The lobby was nice and comfortable and the front desk staff was pleasant. While my room was ready, others in my party waited hours for a room (and we arrived at about 3:30 PM).The official hotel photos looked nice, but the room photos they showed must have been somewhere else in the facility. The photos published by other reviewers were like my room. We had requested a double-double room for three adults. We had two beds, but they were small double beds, not the queens appearing in official photos and implied we would get. I ended up sleeping on the sleeper sofa so my wife and son could rest on a real bed. The sleeper sofa was like sleeping in a hammock without the comfort. It sagged terribly and the framework pressed very firmly across my chest a hips. It was a very uncomfrtable 7 nights. In addition, I discovered the bedding had not been changed prior to my use -- I ended up with insect bites all over my torso that I had initially attributed to a reaction to a laundry detergent.Room service arrived at our room around 5 PM every day except one while we were there. None of the maids spoke English. We had to call housekeeping to find someone who spoke English and ask that the bedding be changed on the sleeper sofa. Otherwise, the ladies did a good job when they finally got there.As written elsewhere, the rooms are severely in need of renovation (which is actually underway). The bathroom (tub and toilet) is very small. You almost have to climb over the toilet to get to the tub. Opening the door while you are in the bathroom is an adventure since the toilet does not allow much free space to move about. The sink is in the bedroom. It appears as the newly renovated rooms will have a more functional bathroom. Supplies were adequate. There is an iron and ironing board in the room, There is a hair dryer by the sink.Air conditioning was adequate, but ran nearly constantly and was a bit noisy. The small kitchen had a very high counter, but included a nice refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker.The TV was in need of replacement. Viewing selctions (the free ones) were pretty limited. There is a TV in the bedroom.Internet access was available either through an ethernet cable (located by the couch) or wireless. There is a $9.95 charge per 24 hours for use of the Internet (it amazes me that far less expensive properties offer this for free). The wireless connection dropped-off at times, making on-line work difficult at times.The pool was very nice. landscaping in the courtyard was enjoyable. There was a Gazebo with misters for outdoor functions.The on-site Agave Grill offered a wonderful free cooked-to-order breakfast every morning. Lunch selections were decent though a bit more expensive than I would like to spend. Dinner selections were expensive and mostly of a Southwest cuisine. You can order off the lunch menu. Other than breakfast, food taste and attractiveness was only fair. Every dinner plate I received was chipped (maybe I kept getting the same plate). The facility offers a Manager's Happy Hour with free soda / pop and reduced price alcohol. There is also free finger food / snacks.There are laundry machines on-site, but be sure you have a supply of quarters -- they have none at the front desk and the bar only has a few.There is a new CVS Pharmacy across the street as well as Mexican grocery store -- otherwise, you need to walk some distance to find anything else...and this is not the best neighborhood. Taxis don't work this area...and if you catch a cab down town, have the hotel address in hand since most cab drivers do not seem to know where this place is located. i could not figure out the Metro bus system, but doubt I would have used it anyway in this area. We had a car -- highly recommended (with a GPS).The complimentary van service to and from the airport was excellent from what others in my party said."
"Review_11168","hotel_111","hotel_4003","Aug 31, 2008","Mediocre by expected standards, and in the midst of a renovation I stayed at this facility while attending The American Legion's National Convention; this was the property to which our delegation was assigned. In terms of what I would expect from the Embassy Suites brand, this was mediocre to disappointing. The property itself is in a marginal/transitional part of the city, and is not particularly convenient to many of the major attractions in the Phoenix area. A traveler staying here would definitely need a car to get around. It is an older facility, though would have much promise with a major upgrade. The rooms are relatively spacious, but a bit spartan and worn. The entry doors were marginally secure. The walls were thin, so any external noise from outside or in adjacent rooms were sometimes quite audible. Some of the electrical outlets worked part of the time, or not at all. The air conditioning was spotty at times. The in-room refrigerator was slow in chilling stored beverages or food items. The bathroom is incredibly small; you very nearly had to step over the toilet to get into the shower/bathtub. The beds were small and rock-hard, which - combined with the spotty air conditioning - could make restful sleep problematic. The televisions were old and in poor working order, and the cable system was even worse, as several featured channels were nothing but snow depending on the time of day, or even the room you were watching in.General cleanliness of the facilities was so-so. Housekeeping was open to the outside, and cleaned bath towels were stacked near the entry, which almost made laundry pointless. Laundry facilities were also outside; while the washer and dryer units were relatively clean, there was no place to fold or stack. Additionally, quarters were virtually a precious commodity in the hotel, and $1.00 only bought you 20 minutes of drying time. Housekeeping services were ridiculously slow and late-arriving. It was not uncommon during the week's stay that your room would be left unserviced until as late as 4:30pm. On average, housekeeping would not arrive until about 3:30pm. My two or three experiences with the front desk staff were generally poor; they did not seem knowledgable about their own property or the area, and could not meet my requests (see above with obtaining quarters for laundry).The saving grace to this property was the Agave Cafe, their on-site restaurant and bar. The staff was very polite, friendly, and responsive - even in busier periods - and the food selection was very good and generous in portion size. Lunch and dinner prices were as to be expected for hotels. Again, this property was not what I expected from what I knew fo the Embassy Suites brand. This property was undergoing a renovation during my stay, which appeared to include a complete rebuild of the guest suites. If they do an extensive renovation, there is some promise to the property, but they will have much work ahead of them to make it a place I could recommend to other travelers."

The front desk was very pleasant and check in no problem but the room was clearly in need of a renovation. All rooms are exterior corridor opening to their courtyard. The interior wall adjacent to the corridor is painted brick and doesnt give a great feel rather it feels like a cheap attempt to hide odd construction. The furnishings were old, wallpaper worn, bathroom needed cleaning and sprucing up etc etc. The location is not, I am now advised, in a very secure part of town.The internet connection ($9.95 per day) is via a ethernet cable which never worked during my two night stay. Luckily, the business center in the lobby was open and working.The hotel has a restaurant on its fifth floor which served decent food.Overall, I was disappointed with the quality of the room and would not return to this property."

We flew in early in the morning and by the time we checked in later in the afternoon we knew that our daughter would have to stay the night with us because she couldn鈥檛 move into her apartment until the next day or day after that. I told the woman at the front desk and thought I鈥檇 have to spend more for my daughter but to my surprise, she gave us a lower rate than the one I鈥檇 booked which was $75 per night [I understand that July/August are the off season months for Phoenix, thus the lower rate]. I agree with a few of the reviewers that the rooms could be updated some, but ours was very comfortable for the 3 nights we were there and we loved the accessibility of the airport. The lobby is very nice and the business center was easily accessible and met our needs. Our breakfast each morning was wonderful, one of the best Embassy Suites breakfasts that I鈥檝e had. My one major complaint was that they charged $9.95 for Internet access in the rooms for a 24-hour period.

The property was o.k. but there were quite a few problems. You judge for yourself. THE BAD:1)If you don't call early they only give a very limited number of late checkouts and it is only 1 hour more than the regular check out time. 2)The hotel pool closed at 8pm due to cleaning. Which was an inconvenience with kids. It was stated no where on the website. Nor when I called the hotel THAT DAY did they mention that. The jacuzzi was nasty and then it was closed the morning of second day we were there. Plus the pool was NOT heated so it was very very cold even during 80 degrgee weather.3) There wansn't anyone patrolling by the pool even though it was right by the front desk, so people were rough housing and throwing ice into the pool. Dumping people into the pool. Ridiculous.4)Apparently if the weather is between 55-70 degrees they will not run the air conditioning. Needless to say it was tooooo HOT for me to sleep at night! Horrible! During the day the air conditioning was not on either and it was in the 80's!5)People were loitering the hall and just hanging outside by their hotel rooms and management did not do anything about it. We had small kids and they were cussing and yelling (even though they had children too).6) The restaurant on site - was ridiculously priced. A Grilled Salmon wtih veggies was $21.95. Steaks were $24.95. there is a lunch menu with sandwiches but they will not give it to you unless you ask for it during dinner!THE GOOD: 1)Free Cook to Order Breakfast2) Free shuttle to and from the airport 3) Friendly front desk staff**Needless to say I would not stay here again just because of the air conditioning situation."

Overall the hotel was nice, although the rooms were somewhat out of date. The lobby was very nice, although the only restrooms were located upstairs. The courtyard area was nice in April, when the weather was not extreme. We had problems with both the TV and the internet service. The air conditioner ran the entire time we were there, and was barely doing the job. It was only in the mid 80's, so I can imagine it would be insufficient if it would have been really hot. The bathroom was tiny, to the point where you had to back up to the tub to even shut the door. The sink area is in the bedroom, so it is impossible for one to sleep if the other one has to get up. The blackout curtains were nice, and actually worked. The linens needed updating. Because of flight differences, I stayed at the hotel for several hours after my husband, and did find the staff very friendly and the shuttle service to the hotel convenient and efficient."

I traveled to Phoenix on business in February and stayed at the Embassy Suites Phoenix Airport for two nights. I was very impressed with the big roomy rooms. I've never stayed in an Embassy Suites before, so I don't know if they are all like this, but it had a front room with a bedroom in the back, a nice desk and TV out front and a separate TV and table in the bedroom. It just seemed very classy and like the kind of place you could actually bear staying at for several days of business or fun. I liked the big central courtyard with the pool (though I didn't use the pool) and the 24 hour snack shop near the front desk was useful... :) Perhaps the very best part was the awesome custom cooked free breakfast in the dining room. The chef there takes your order and cooks eggs/pancakes/sausage/ etc to your liking and then you add fruit etc and your off to a great start for the day...Problems: (just a couple)1) The line at breakfast was always just a bit too long2) They charged extra for internet access ($10/day).

"Review_11178","hotel_111","hotel_8380","Mar 1, 2008","Hot ,noisy, dirty but food is good According the hotel, in the fall season the air conditioning has to be turned off to be ready for winter. Unfortunately the conference participants staying in the hotel were not informed of this fact. The weather was in the 80's during the day and our room was 85+ at night. A few fans were given out but the only window in our suite faced the busy street on the ground floor and had no screen. We requested a room change but were told none were available. Repeated complaints to the front desk resulted in several free meals at the restaurant- which actually was very good and, oddly, airconditioned unlike the rooms. Nothing was done about the room temperature or the screens or the fan which fell out of the open window.A month after our stay there was an expose on Good Morning America of the cleaning practices at this hotel. They showed cleaning staff wiping floors with used towels and then using the same towels to clean drinking glasses. It wasn't that surprising after our stay."

Also included in the room rate were free cocktails from 5:30 to 7:30 every evening. The usual well drinks, draft beer ( light and dark) and wine. Unusual was frozen drinks were also included.This hotel has some great perks for only approx. 28 dollars more than the Comfort Inn right down the street. I believe the 28 dollars were more than spent by myself and my sister on the breakfasts not to mention the free cocktails.I recommend this hotel."

So we drove about ten minutes to this Embassy suites for the 4th of July weekend and had a blast. The hotel has a very large circular pool that very comfortably accomodated all of its guests over that busy holiday weekend. My kids loved it! The room was clean and comfortable. Not quite as shiny and new looking as you would expect Embassy Suites to be, but it was okay. The best part is the cook to order breakfast. What a money saver, especially when traveling with the family, and the food was delicious. They will make you an omelet with your choice of ingredients. They also have all the potatoes, sausage, fruit, danishes or just scrambled eggs that you can eat. Plus they have a variety of fruit juices and coffee. It was great! My family and I had a great time, it was an affordable get away from the heat staycation."

Ruth put a rush on my room's readiness with housekeeping and it was ready within 30 minutes. The room was a fine but there were stains on the carpet. The floor was uneven as it inclined at the front door, which caused me to trip a couple of times, which is not good for someone with low vision. The carpet was not marked to reflect this unevenness. The walkways around the rooms were also uneven and often difficult to navigate for someone with low vision. When I tried to take a nap, I saw a 1/2 inch long white bug crawling in my bed. Other convention attendees had other kinds of bugs but were told they would go away by staff. On the last day, we ran out of toilet paper. On the good side, the staff I dealt with was VERY nice and helpful. Giovanni in the restaurant went out of his way to serve us well. The food, especially the breakfast, was excellent. The meeting facilities were top notch and the serving staff and bartenders were competent and obliging. The property was gorgeous and very relaxing and I thoroughly enjoyed the pool."

It had two TVs, both of which were fuzzy and had remotes that barely worked (some buttons were simply dead). The tub was so small that I fear even a 5 year old would overflow it trying to bathe. Four out of five pillows were hard and old, the drawers on both bedside tables would spontaneously open and the doors to the main closet fell off. The main lobby is quite nice, and the restaurant, Lafitte's, was delicious and well-priced. The pool is nice, but there were no umbrellas on any of the tables which I found weird considering the scorching 100 degree sun. Basically this is a once-amazing hotel that has aged and gone into disrepair a bit. If they were to reno the rooms, and upgrade, they could return to prominence as a choice hotel. Until they do overhaul though, I would recommend against a stay there."

The location was nice and close to many restaurants. We found the front desk staff very accomodating and friendly. I can't say much for the Happy Hour though.

Breakfast  cocktails are nice extras, but not worth the price!The room... mildew in the shower, gray line along the carpet edges (they don't know how to clean the edges of a room!). The message light on the old room phone was flashing  engineering couldn't figure out how to fix it, so I unplugged it. The walkways outside the rooms were covered with trash... daily, we saw bandaid wrappers, cigarette butts, in piles  rubbed down to their filters, and even a used qtip. gross! As for the non-functioning business center... not one day did the printer work. The room was a mess, no printer paper, messes left behind, and computers would freeze when you used them!Our first night there, someone spilled a sticky drink in the elevator... the mess was still there 3 days later when we checked out. The area around the pool is nicely groomed  well kept. Everything else is falling apart  housekeeping is marginal.Was told they are going to renovate... well, I suggest they do that yesterday.

Breakfast every morning is fresh, and omelets are wonderful. Only small problem is the wait if they are busy, but that is to be expected. Front desk folks are very professional and personable, except for the one exception I ran into on the late night shift. Pool and tennis courts are wondeful, and the entire property is very well maintained. We did have one problem with a noise in the pipes in the bathroom every morning. They offered to move us, but we were so busy with baseball Spring Training, we didn't have time to move. When I checked out, I suggested that they have someone sleep in the room to hear the noises we heard, as engineering could not identify the noise when it wasn't happening. The front desk gentleman listened to my suggestion (not a complaint), then handed me my bill. He had dropped my rate by $50 and taken off the night I had the problem with the night personnel. (The problem was a vehicle outside our room that had left it's lights on, shining into our room. ) This was, by far, the most enjoyable visit I have ever had at a Hilton property, and will definitely return to stay for Spring Training next year."

I shared the room with a friend from Grad School and we could have gone without seeing each other for days inside this room! Internet worked great, the room was clean (although not the most modern I've had). The included breakfast was good, although it's a bit of a pain getting to your room...The property is several unconnected buildings...If you can't get parking in front of your building, it can be a hike to your door.

Our first room was one on the freeway side (very noisy) and was obviously dirty. Plastic wrappers other assorted bit of things on the carpet everywhere but the candy beside the bed was the clincher. Moved rooms to the next building facing the courtyard and pool. This is definitely the side to request. This room was slightly better in the center of the room but when we opened the sofabed - DISGUSTING under there. There was some type of white substance smeared across the front of the TV control panel and on the remote. Other stuff on the arms of the sofa. Yuck. I assumed if you can't get a clean room out of 2, three is not likely any better so we cleaned the tv and put up with the debris under the sofabed. The rest of the place is nice, the courtyard and pool area. Excellent breakfast included. There was also a great dinner special in Lafitte's, and the service was excellent. Overpriced for the dirty rooms, so I would suggest a request for a thorough cleaning when you book. Too bad because this could be a great place - but I probably would think twice before I stayed again."

I was a little bit hesitant the first time i stayed there and planned to have 3 overnights as you normally only want to stay max one night at any kind of Airport Hotel. But the Hilton is really a good choice, not the kind of Airport Hotel Experience that you normally have. The bar is good, the staff very friendly, the rooms are nice and the location is pretty calm. Only negative comment: the FB Manager should look at the Menue of the restaurant. Not really a good idea to have dinner there....Additonally, you should have a car if you plan to stay there as the taxi services in Phoenix are pretty poor (long waiting time).The shuttle service to the Airport is free with a frequency of 30 minutes.Fair rates."

"Review_11199","hotel_113","hotel_9478","Jul 4, 2008","Odd Location, Nice Bed I just returned from two decent nights at this Hilton. The hotel was a big disappointment at first. When I walked in, the lobby was barely cooler than outside (110 degrees.) Checking in was quick, and they gave me a cold bottle of water, but the staff couldn't answer my simple question (Where can we get a quick dinner around here?) The decor throughout the hotel was old and tired, and the faint odor didn't help. The elevator was completely stuffy, so I chose the stairs after just two tries on the elevator. The room was just like the hallways - old and slightly smelly, but at least the temperature was lower. The bathroom was tiny, but compared to the rest of the hotel, it was beautiful. Everything in the room looked clean, but I didn't dare sit on the couch or the desk chair. The lamp switches were all slightly sticky, and I did my best to ignore that. As with all Hilton hotels nowadays, there were cards with instructions about how to get the sheets and towels changed. Since I was only there for two nights, I ended up putting the do-not-disturb sign out the entire time (no need for housekeeping to come in if they're not going to change my sheets or towels.)Two things made the entire stay a 3 star instead of a 2 star. First, the sheets were completely clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Second, the bathroom was clean, and the water pressure was great.In terms of location, this Hilton is apparently in a weird place. Two different long-time Phoenix residents had trouble finding the place because it is (a) not near most other airport hotels, (b) off a little-known highway that's only two miles long, and (c) near some bad parts of town. There were no restaurants or shops nearby, and driving back to the airport was also a bit of a challenge."

The first 2 rooms they gave us were firstly across the hall from the ice machine and secondly backed onto it! The third room was fine. We started to think that we were on candid camera as we had to go back down to reception each time to get a new room. Luckily we kept a sense of humour about it and the reception staff were very helpful.We ate in the bar and the food was good and reasonably priced. We had eaten in the restaurant on a previous trip because the bar was very busy but this time it was fine.The courtesy bus took us to the car rental centre for $5 the following day but be careful about this as you come in on a lower level and there may not be luggage trolleys.Going back to the ice machine I would recommend not accepting rooms that end in the range -16 to -26"

The hotel has been well maintained, since my last stay several years ago. My check in was quick and the front desk staff was very helpful. I did not use very many of the hotel amenities, since most of my time was spent in central Phoenix. I liked the hotel's location between two expressways that connected to the metro Phoenix freeway system. The room was quiet, considering the close proximity to the airport and the major freeways. My one complaint is that there was the odor of exhaust fumes in the lobby and the upper floor hallways. I would suspect that they use a gas-powered machine to clean the floors in the main lobby. To be fair, others in my party could not detect the smell in their lower floor rooms.The kiosk by the front desk allows you to quickly check in as well as to print boarding passes is a great addition.

We went to the hot tub every night and there was never anybody in it which was great. There are 2 restaurants on site, one with a bar. The bar is expensive by our tastes ($4.95 for a Budweiser draft for example) so I would recommend going somewhere else to drink. Though I don't remember the prices on the food menu, they were high enough for us not to order anything. If needed there is a Denny's .25 miles east of the hotel hiding in another hotel's parking lot. The hotel room has internet access available for a fee (there is free weather, news, basic info).

I felt a little silly at that point, but truly could not have managed on my own power - I was just that sick, weak and dizzy.It proved to be a long and difficult night, so I can't say much about the property itself, but it was greatly comforting to know that if we had needed anything else, we were sure the staff would help us out in any way they could. Many thanks to the staff."

After staying there, I'd have to say it was more like a 3 star, and a nice 3 star at that. Nice room with Sleep Number beds, free wi-fi, free coffee in the lobby, and a friendly staff. Combine that with the fact that I paid $36 + tax for a night's stay and I have to give this hotel 4 stars on yelp."
"Review_11221","hotel_114","hotel_4284","Apr 21, 2008","Don't get stuck in a handicapped accessible room! Booked our stay via Hotwire and was initially pleased at the great price. We checked in after a long day of flying and were told that the only available room was a handicapped accessible room. Normally I find these rooms to offer lots more space, without compromising much else. HOWEVER, with the exception of the comfortable bed, this room was a disaster. No bathtub in the bathroom (big problem when you have an 18 month old that is afraid of showering). Worse yet is that the shower consisted of a showerhead. No shower curtain, no partition. In fact, all the water from the shower ends up drenching the entire bathroom floor because the shower area is actually on a raised surface, allowing the water to cascade down and collect all over creation. This could create a dangerous situation for those who actually are handicapped. No counter space in the bathroom. There is a small counter area with zero lighting outside of the bathroom - completely useless. Our toiletries were quite aptly named, seeing that they were placed on the back of the toilet (really nice touch Radisson!). Definitely will not stay again."

The lobby is decent and the breakfast buffet was pretty good. However, they put us in a room equipped for a disabled person. The bathroom was terrible, did not seem clean, no bathtub, and no partition between the shower and the rest of the bathroom. That's right not even a shower curtain. It felt like you were taking a shower in a dorm. Water was everywhere, but how could you help it. Avoid."

What an exceptional experience and worth every penny! Every staff member we encountered spoke to us and most called us by name and congratulated us on our anniversary. Our room was unbelievably beautiful and opened on to a courtyard area with gorgeous landscaping, a reflection pool and fire pits which were lit each night. We had dinner one night at T. Cook's and it was one of the nicest meals we have ever had. The breakfast we had the following morning was quite good, as well. We would definitely recommend the resort to others and hope to return ourselves some day!"

Our room was not ready when we arrived, but they held our luggage and called us when it was set, for we headed out for a while. It was a lovely room with a great view of Camelback Mountain. The orange trees surrounding our room were great and having a private patio was fantastic. The pool was small, but served its purpose of cooling us off and giving us time to relax. The Spa is out of this world. Our 60 min. couples massage was great, expensive but fabulous. T. Cook's restarant was out of this world. The combination of flavors and presentation was beyond words!! Checking out their website was the best bet of all, I was able to see their specials and was able to get one night free!Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in, luxury, relaxation and beauty surrounds everything at this resort."

However, the visit was not half of what I expected. I booked one of the casita rooms, and while the bathroom was excellent, the rest of the room was dark, dusty, and not particularly appealing.To make things worse, there were black bugs all over the room (rolipolis 鈥?I am not sure if they have a more technical name). The night we checked in there was nothing we could do about it except hope for the best. The second night the staff sprayed the room 鈥?however the bugs remained and they had to come back in the next few days as well 鈥?not what I would expect from such a pricey and well-rated venue. Nothing was done to compensate us for this continuously unpleasant experience. Additionally, the reception staff and restaurant wait staff, as mentioned by another reviewer, was not particularly friendly or helpful. They did not recommend restaurants, excursion trips, or anything that would be useful for one鈥檚 first visit to Pheonix. We were also charged $70 for minibar items that we did not use. I had to call the hotel once I saw my credit card bill to have the charges reversed. To be honest, the only service I was really happy with was the valet service. The pool was ok ay鈥?small and felt more like a backyard pool than one of a hotel resort. The rest of the grounds are very lovely 鈥?nice flowers and architecture.

Having read the previous posts by other travellers we did have high expectations, all of which were exceeded. The Spanish/Moorish designed space was full of hidden spots for enjoying the mountain views or stolen kisses. Fire pits with cozy cushions made it delightful to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful views and weather in the evening. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at T Cooks one evening.

The hotel bar is charming and the dinner we had at TCooks was excellent. Try the paella. I had a fantastic Watsu treatment at the Spa and would highly recommend it. The entire staff was warm and friendly, not stiff and formal. However, they seemed frazzled the day we checked out as there was a large group checking in. I called the front desk to ask for an extra hour to check out and was curtly told they were not allowing any late check outs that day. I just thought it might have been handled a bit better. Still, a lovely respite in the middle of the desert. We enjoyed our stay."

We picked this hotel thanks to Trip Advisor and it was wonderful. The staff was attentive and charming, the property was intimate and private. Movie stars from the 40's and 50's used to escape Hollywood and stay at this very property. The atmosphere was old world hacienda with soft music playing, plenty of flowers and delicious iced tea in the lobby.  We attended a special James Beard gourmet dining experience that was as elegant as any NY restaurant. Our tablemates couldn't have been more charming, gracious and fun.  Our room was ample, offered a 2 person soaking tub, soft bed and plenty of air conditioning. Our biggest complaint was the hot weather, which wasn't the fault of the hotel.

"Review_11238","hotel_115","hotel_1346","Aug 19, 2008","Wonderfully relaxing with great service My wife and I decided to visit Phoenix to get a break from the humidity where we live. After much research, we settled on the Royal Palms. We were not disappointed.On arrival, the valet staff were cheery and helpful, even offering to run small errands for us, such as a trip to the corner store, etc. The check-in process was smooth and the gentleman helping us with our bags was well informed about the resort's features, history, and amenities. The property is lush and well planted - a tropical oasis in the middle of the dessert. Beautiful.The rooms were clean, warm and inviting. The view of Camelback Mountain from our room was very romantic. The housekeeping staff were very thorough and the nightly turn-down service was a nice touch.I was suffering from a cold so we decided to stay in one evening. My wife ordered room service and when the wait staff arrived and noticed the cough syrup on the table, he showed genuine concern, explaining that the Royal Palms took illness very seriously and he would be happy to have the chef prepare some chicken soup and a hot toddy.Caring and attentive service was found throughout the property, with the pool attendants offering the best service. They were always ready to fill a drink, bring a glass of water, find a chair, refresh towels, etc. The pool bar closes a little early (6pm?) but the pool and hot-tub remain open all night. Great relief from the heat. The pool area was basically adults only. There was an occassional kid, but I got the impression children weren't encouraged. In fact, I overheard one of the valet's radio the pool attendant to let him know that Shamu had arrived (a family with an inflatable whale). They put a stop to that and we never did see Shamu or the kids.The restaurant was exceptionally good, although I did have one negative experience when I chose to sit outside to eat. We sat for about ten minutes and never did see any wait staff, even though the maitre'd assured us there was service on the patio. To be fair, it was very hot and nobody in their right mind would want to be outside and I was sick and didn't wait very long before leaving to head to our room.The lounge, adjacent to the restaurant had a great selection of drinks, a funky vibe, and great entertainment. It was hard to find a seat, but once seated the service was very attentive.My wife and I both had spa treatments while we were there. The spa was nothing spectacular, but very comfortable. Noticing I had a terrible cough, the masseuse even took the time to call me the next day to give me the name of a cough syrup his doctor had recommended to him.I noticed that some travellers complained about the $22 per day resort fee. This fee includes valet parking and all tips. It is a bargain - you would spend that much on valet in most hotels.Speaking of valet, if you call ahead before leaving your room, the valets will have your car ready and waiting with the air conditioner on.I fell in love with the place and will definitely be back."

Once you pull up into the courtyard, you feel like you are transported into another world. Aside from the immaculate service and lush, impeccable grounds, the vibe is the ultimate in laid-back luxury. Trust me, you will not have to lift a finger while you are there. We went into Old Town Scottsdale once and came to the conclusion that there was really no point in leaving our perfect oasis! The resort is perfect for a romantic getaway (next time we are going with our husbands, and trust me, there will be a next time!), but if you go with a friend you'll feel right at home too. People actually dress for dinner - this is not a t-shirt  shorts place, which is oh so fun if you're used to being in mommy-mode.

It was the most luxurious hotel that I have stayed at in a long time and is so relaxing. We opted just to stay in one of the standard rooms and it was fabulous. It is like having your own little villa with a small patio overlooking the lime trees and Camelback mountain. We never head another person walk by our room or any other noises during the day. The pool is quite crowded so if you are going to hang out at the pool then you might not like this hotel but if you are going for some relaxing ambiance then this is the place. We will be returning."
"Review_11243","hotel_115","hotel_5804","Aug 3, 2008","Wonderful! We loved every second of our five-day stay at the Royal Palms Resort  Spa. The grounds were beautiful- well maintained and had a tropical feel. The pool is small- not great for laps, but wonderful for floating. I think the smallish number of chairs might be a problem when the hotel is fuller than it probably was when we were there. The umbrellas are huge and offered a lot of shade, but if you wanted sun you could have it (do you want to sit in the sun in 105 degree heat?). We stayed in room 138, which had the world's most comfortable bed, a nice sitting area, a flat-screen television with standard cable, a private area outside and a newly redone bathroom. Housekeeping kept the rooms spotless. We enjoyed turndown service every night and looked forward to cards and candies we would find. The restaurant is good, but expensive. You can eat at the lounge, where entrees range in price from about $14 to about $40. If you do, definitely try the tempura asparagus- it was a highlight! There is a $22 daily gratuity fee attached to your nightly stay, and it is totally worth it. I cannot stress enough how attentive the staff is. When we called for our car, the men actually ran to get it to us faster. The concierge was wonderful, and when we did have a mix-up with a resort activity we had signed up for but wasn't offered, they bent over backwards to make it up to us. We would love to return!"
"Review_11244","hotel_115","hotel_5489","Aug 3, 2008","simply great hotel with service to match Just had a wonderful six night stay at the Palms with my wife. Had a shock at check-in when they told me of the $22 a night service charge but it was worth every cent, due to the excellent friendly staff at the resort (special mention to the pool staff and the car valets), who earned it and more. Very few negatives and lots of positives. The pool area is not the largest and would be pushed to serve everyones needs when the hotel is full. However when it is quiet, as when we were there, then it is ideal. Staff keep you supplied with constant iced water (free of charge), food if required and move the parasols when required, so you do not over do the sunbathing (unless you realy do want to fry). Rooms comforable and there is a turn down service supplied at night. The attention to detail is excellent. Will be going back again as it also makes an excellent base to see the rest of Arizona."

This resort is small and romantic and the landscape is gorgeous; even in the heat of the summer, the grounds were lush and full. I was there with my husband, my parents, and my sister on a family vacation, but the resort was predominantly couples. The few families that came to the intimate pool left quickly when they saw that the atmosphere was quiet and not conducive to loud children. The service was absolutely unbelievable at every turn (Rick at the pool takes service to another level...) and, in the one case it wasn't (the spa did not have our appointments in its system), the extremely apologetic staff bent over backwards to accommodate us.

Enjoyed an excellent meal in the restaurant though again the decoration was a little old fashoined. Highlight of stay was sitting in a courtyard with a bottle of wine under the stars.

We booked a standard room, and while it was clean and nicely appointed, it was quite small. The bath tub was ridiculous! An older person would have found it unuseable. We almost needed a step stool to get into it. We found the concierge to be helpful enough, but the front desk attendant seemed to have a forced smile and never mailed our postcards (after offering to do so).We had a delicious dinner at T.

On a brighter note, our food server could not have been more attentive and gracious.The grounds of the Royal Palms are pretty, and the valet attendants were very speedy and pleasant.

I treated my husband to a weekend there for his birthday in May, and was not really sure what to expect. We had previously stayed at the Biltmore, which was always delightful, but I thought we should explore something new. Lucky for us, our friends recommended this resort and it turned out to be one of those where have you been all my life? experiences. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was PERFECT. We can't wait for a reason to get back up there, unbearable Phoenix heat and all (we live in Tucson and everyone knows it is always at least 10 degrees hotter in Phoenix than Tucson and even when it's over 100, it MATTERS). **Bonus Tip: for a lovely, intimate, absolutely five star meal, go to Christopher's at the Biltmore Plaza.

I love the Royal Palms. The whole property is beautiful, the resort is small enough to feel intimate, and the service is always amazing.I like the Montevista Terrace rooms, which have a patio or balcony overlooking a central courtyard with a decorative pool and pretty sitting areas set around firepits. The rooms are a decent size and beautifully decorated with particularly nice bathrooms which have deep oval soaking tubs and separate shower cubicles. There is even a 'window (no glass, just an opening with shutters to close if you want privacy) cut into the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom which is a nice touch. The Estate rooms are basically the same, and in the same building, but don't have a patio or balcony and lack the view.The only downside is the smallish pool area. The pool is beautiful, the sunloungers very comfortable and the service great, but the pool area and the pool itself are quite small and so both can feel crowded and noisy if the hotel is busy. Luckily it's not a very child-friendly hotel so it tends to be groups of adults only, but even then it can get a bit frenetic and noisy at the pool which you might find annoying if you're looking for peace and quiet. Nevertheless, it's hard to find fault with anything and I've had 3 very enjoyable visits (March 07, Dec 07 and Apr08)."

The hotel is certainly geared towards romance and it did not disappoint. The room was beautifully appointed with shutters above the sunken tub that open on to the room.

We had dinner at T Cooks and enjoyed sitting out on the terrace looking at the stars. Breakfast was also very good.

Rick, one of the men that works at the pool restaurant even read my mind one day when I was debating whether or not to have ice cream. I swear he didn't hear me and brought me a sample!We ate breakfast and lunch everyday at the hotel and everything was delicious. All in all, we would highly recommend it and would go back happily.

We had a spa room which was absolutly wonderful. The bed was comfortable and the steam shower was a great touch. Rick and Jose at the pool were exceptional. The resort was booked that weekend but you would not have known. There were plently of seats open at the pool and we had no problem getting into the resturant. Our room services came extremely quick and the food exceeded expectations. I would recommend this resort to anyone looking to get away and have a nice relaxing vacation. My husband and I travel a lot and this is one of the best places we have ever stayed."

I did not select this hotel as we were with a group for a wedding. Our rooms were $567 per night with a $22.00 resort fee to cover gratuities. Very high I felt!The grounds of the resort are amazing. Lush with lots and lots of flowers. We stayed in two casitas connecting with King Beds. Which were perfect. Away from the main hotel with nice courtyards in front to enjoy breakfast! Ours had a small water fountain also. The rooms were above average with nice beds and comfortable furnishings. One room had a fireplace although not cool enough outside to use it. The bathroom was just OK.All the staff were courteous and helpful. Questions were answered immediately especially room service. I requested several special dishes with no problem. I would recommend this resort to others even though I had a slight issue with Jose by the pool. On our first morning to the resort we took our two children (5  9) to the pool. We were out early probably by 9:30 that morning. The pool area had a few guests already but not many. My children had only been in the pool a few minutes when Jose approached me to tell me my children had to quote, not yell, horseplay, jump, splash or play Marco Polo in the pool. and that he was just telling me before he got complaints. I was shocked. I've never been told this before at any other resort from Westin, Hyatt, Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. I said I would tell them but they are children and they may make noise. Needless to say we didn't stay long by the pool. I was not told at check in there were restrictions on children using the pool so I was confused by this comment by Jose. The next day I checked with the front desk and they did not know why Jose would tell us that and that children are allowed in the pool area as long as they are accompanied by an adult. The Manager-Hillary did leave me a nice message in our room apologizing for this but we never did get an answer as to why we were told this. That same day we spent several hours by the pool and there were other children jumping and splashing all over the pool so I really don't understand why Jose told us this. While I would recommend this resort I would probably choose a different hotel if we return with our children. It's a great place for adults and my husband and I would stay here again but without our children."

"Review_11265","hotel_115","hotel_1127","Mar 20, 2008","A Perfect Romantic Getaway! My husband and I were looking for a great place for a Romantic getaway for 3 nights. After a lot of research of Phoenix and Scottsdale resorts, we choose Royal Palms mainly because it is more exclusive and smaller than the large resorts (the Phoenician is a couple of streets over). Especially after learning that it was spring break and many hotels were close to being 100% booked, I definitely didn't want to go to a place that was so booked that I would have to wait for everything, pool, gym, breakfast, valet. The Royal Palms makes you feel like you are among very few people and have alot of privacy. They have a very nice pool (just 1) and the staff throughout the hotels is very attentive and nice. The valet and bellmen are just wonderful, we never had to wait long to pick up or drop off our car. The front desk even printed out our boarding passes the day before we left, which we are so grateful of after seeing the enormous lines at the airport. We may have been late for the flight, in which case my husband would have yelled at me for since I am always running late!This is the kind of place for someone looking for privacy and doesn't care about having 3 pools and many loung bars through the hotel. It is a smaller hotel but that really is the beauty of it. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous with camelback mountain in the back drop. The hotel itself is mediteranean style with beautiful antique pieces throughout. The doorways each have so much character, they look as though they have been there for 100 years.The spa was lovely, we had a couple's massage followed by a botanical bath in a private room with a small terrace. We would definitely stay there if we ever return to Phoenix!"

This former mansion turned resort is a lovely hideaway made for gentle relaxation. My husband and I enjoyed one quiet night here with spa treatments in the morning. The staff are very attentive but not annoyingly so. There's a sense of them knowing what it takes to please high maintenance folks indeed. I would definitely recommend this for couples (and probably older ones at that - not a lot on offer for those in search of nightlife). The Royal Palms lived up to the billing it gets here on TripAdvisor."
"Review_11267","hotel_115","hotel_7016","Mar 15, 2008","def. a pool experience After plenty research (as usual) I had my heart set on Royal Palms (my boyfriend doesn't appreciate all my hard work in finding the right place). He seems to think it's just by accident we stay at places we do :)Anyway, stayed over Labor Day, and was positively giddy over mainly two things that stood out to me. One, the whole pool experience. The blond guy (I'm bad with names) was like a walking hand-book in steps of service. Flawless in other words. I do love the accomodating approach, one that he def. mastered (which could not be said for his sidekick). In 104 degrees heat, one would be dependent on the pool no?! I guess the different flavoured Pina Coladas didn't hurt either.The second wow-factor was owed to the food. Top notch, roomservice as well as in the restaurant (same kitchen, but that doesn't nec. guarantee anything). In particular we were hooked on some of the breakfast items, so much that we squeezed one in before our checking out, a last one...Other than that the grounds were very pretty. Ordinarily we would stay at smaller capacity hotels, not used to sharing lol. The first room we were offered must have been on top of a flight hangar, or the back of the restaurant turbines, same thing. But that was corrected immediately. We had booked a Designer Casita, which turned out to be quite spacious, with a sturdy bed.My only complaint was the standard of the bathroom. We had been warned at the time of booking that it would be a standard bathroom, but for the room level I don't think I've had such a basic bathroom ever. Leaves room for improvement.Over all we were happy with RPH, and would return again on our next visit to Phoenix."

This place is expensive ($429, although I think I had a free upgrade), but I would return on my own dime to stay there again because it is so wonderful. The property is absolutely gorgeous, and I stayed in Room 123 - large king bed, gas fireplace, massive beautiful bathroom with clawfoot tub and dual-faucet shower, great products from the spa onsite, and two patios, one very private with a water fountain. The spa is wonderful - I had one of the best massages of my life from Ryan. We ate at the restaurant afterward and had a fabulous meal and bottle of wine. The wine list is great fun - whoever put it together has added helpful comments and wine publication ratings. The only way my stay could have been better is if I could have skipped my conference and spent the whole time onsite."

The renovation turned out beautifully. We had a fireplace in our room, steam shower, flat screen TV's. The only thing that could have been better was the workout room. Only a few of the cardio machines had TV's on them. But I have been traveling in Asia, and the workout rooms were incredible so maybe I am spoiled. And the room service menu was missing from my room and I called to get one twice--but it never came.There were fire pits throughout, gorgeous lights for the holiday, beautiful landscape. The lounge is a great place to have a drink and listen to some music, and the food at T. Cooks is delicious! I do miss Paul though!!I will only stay here if I can help it!"
"Review_11273","hotel_115","hotel_7950","Jan 20, 2008","Perfection I don't know where to start. This hotel is simply spectactular. I was a guest at the hotel in June 2007. Traveling to Arizona to attend a wedding, I first took a quick side trip to Tucson, to visit friends, and stayed at the Arizona Inn there. How disappointing! Beautiful grounds, great pool, but the room was mediocre, a bit tattered and worn, and overall did not measure up to the positive reviews I saw on tripadvisor, and which prompted me to book my stay there. So, my expectations were relatively muted when I made my way to Phoenix and Royal Palms. On entering the property, I was blown away by the stunning architecture and gardening. In the reservation desk area, they had a pitcher of tasty and refreshing pink lemonade (Lord knows it was certainly HOT!) and I was greeted warmly by the reservation agent. Here's where things started to get real good. Traveling in the off-season, I thought I'd secured a pretty good deal - I believe it was $150/night for one of their basic rooms. Well, without even asking, I was upgraded to one of the new Spa Suite rooms. When the bellboy took me to my room, and opened the door, I almost fainted. It was stunning! On entering the room, the sounds of soothing, acoustic music enveloped you. The lighting was just right, dim, and romantic. The first part of the room is a sitting area with a luxurious, turkish-like seatte, full of comfy pilows - across from that you had an impressive entertainment unit and a small wet bar area. In the center of the room was the most luxurious bath I've ever had the privilege of looking at, let alone, using! Deep, soaking tub, those bowl sinks that sit on top of the the vanity. A walk-in steam shower, lotions, shower gels, shampoo and conditioners that were heavenly! You then enter the bedroom, and it was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Just gorgeous. Dark stained wood floors. Two plasma tvs (one in the sitting area, another in the bedroom). And to top it off, a beautiful balcony that looked over a stunning courtyard area. One afternoon we were serenaded by a spanish guitartist. Pinch me - I must be dreaming!! Unfortunately, it was so daggone hot, I couldn't really take advantage of the balcony. Also, because I was running around a bit for wedding activities, a long day trip to the Grand Canyon and The Police concert the Monday before I left, I really didn't get to enjoy the room for my 4 night stay as much as I would have liked. But that just gives me an excuse to make a return trip - during a better -cooler - time of the year.Oh - and service. Talk about going the extra mile. I discovered that my credit card was missing from my purse. I couldn't find it anywhere. I wasn't sure if I'd dropped it while shopping or possibly in the car. Well, one of the valets did a painstaking search throughout my rental car and managed to find the card in a really obscure location. I guess it had fallen out of my purse while I was driving. I was so grateful for the time and effort this gentleman put into finding the lost item. Overall, service was exemplary throughout my stay.Royal Palms has spoiled me for life when it comes to hotel accomodations. I doubt there is a place that will ever measure up to my experience last summer. The surprise factor alone of getting such a beautiful room at a fraction of it's normal nightly rate is something I'll likely never experience again. In a nutshell, Royal Palms is simply amazing!! Or as one of my good friends likes to put it: All that and a bag of chips!!!You won't be disappointed..."

I was there once with my daughter for her college spring break for the Ladies Fling, once with my husband for our anniversary and once as a family. This resort was great for all of these vacations. It is small which is a refreshing change from staying at huge hotels. It was pricey, but worth saving up for. We were treated like royalty. I liked the resort fee concept which relieved us of having to worry about tipping the staff. Everyone working there seemed to truely enjoy their jobs. The rooms were luxurous in a tasteful comfortable way and we could enjoy our mornings and evenings on the patio right outside our room. The grounds and pool were gorgeous. If I had to find something that wasn't perfect it would be that they were short of pool chairs during peek swimming times, and some guests would stake them out for the entire day. However when we were at the pool we felt like we were really on vacation sipping our drinks delivered to us poolside. The spa was awesome and dining at the restaurant was truely a gourmet experience. Staying at the Royal Palms is magical."

The resort is very unique with stunning grounds and suprises at every turn. Beautiful outdoor public areas and very interesting historical furniture throughout.Jose at the pool is simply the best! This dude more than took care of us throughout the stay (even if his wrist was having some issues). Quite frankly, I would return for the pool service alone.We stayed in a Casita which was awesome. Great little patio area that was perfect for reading the paper and enjoying a wake-up beverage in the morning. Bed very comforable and furnishings made you feel you were someplace special.Really enjoyed the T. Cooke's Sunday Brunch. Other meals there were also very good.

The sales representative on the phone convinced me with her attitude and friendliness that this would be a good place for me and my friend, who was going through a tough time emotionally.It offers a great luxury alternative to big chain spa hotels. It is in a beautiful, historic setting that creates a much more intimate ambience. I would go back with my husband for a romantic weekend, definitely.It was beautiful, relaxing, and the service was excellent. Our room was huge, and although it overlooked the parking lot, still had a nice view, and was extremely comfortable. The beds were great, the bathtub was the size of a swimming pool.The grounds are absolutely lovely, and worth strolling round. The staff are really wonderful. Everyone knew our names, and made sure they pronounced them properly.The restaurant was excellent, food, service, value for money (surprisingly reasonable, considering it is very highly rated).The spa is a little small for the size of the hotel. As it was very cold during our stay, we couldn't enjoy all the outdoor areas. If it had been warmer we would have probably spent longer there. The indoor relaxation areas are very small, and only two showers, which seems a little odd.Only quibble with the room: poor lighting in the bathroom makes it hard for us middle-aged women to put on make-up!"

Great location for business and near all Spring Training facilities in the west side of Phoenix. University of Phoenix Stadium, where the Cardinals play football is just 15 minutes away. This side of the valley has grown and has much to offer the traveler. The Westgate center, right next to the stadium has it all! This place has all amenities for the business traveler and leisure guests. I heard they are under contruction for a brand new lobby bar and will include the Link@Sheraton. The link is a great gathering area to do work on your laptop and printing services while enjoying a cup of Starbucks Coffee. I was blown away with the service the staff provided! This hotel gets it in this economy on how they treat their guests. I didnt get that at the nearby hotels during other business trips. I felt at home and welcomed as soon as i walked in.

"Review_11280","hotel_116","hotel_5739","Jun 25, 2008","Decent setup, rooms need a facelift The one thing I liked about the Sheraton is that everything is within one facility, as compared to several other properties in the area, mostly Hilton properties. The pool and gym is a quick walk downstairs. There is a concierge lounge with a friendly staff. The front desk staff was nice too. The lobby was okay but it seems like the rooms, even the ones on the club floor, can use some renovations. The setup is typical of a Sheraton with a bed, a seating area, a desk where I can turn the flat screen tv to face, and not much else. Not huge rooms but comfy for those who are used to staying at Sheraton properties.The week I was staying there, there were a bunch of teenagers for MEP training (military enlistment program) who occupied the pool at night and I'd see all over the property. I am not sure if this was a one time thing, as I saw a sign on the second floor for MEP. So they may be a regular fixture.The Sheraton may not be as high end as some of the Hilton brand properties in the area but for SPG fans, this is a convenient alternative."

No problems with housekeeping; didn't eat at the restaurant.Some reviewers have mentioned the noise from the interstate, and though I was on the end way from it, I still heard some noise from the surface street on my end. Didn't bother me, but might be a problem for light sleepers. No noise from other rooms or hallway at all, though. Only other drawback I saw was no free Internet.

You know that festive cabana bar by the pool? It was never open. Neither was the waterslide. Did you see the picture on the website of the woman getting a hot stone massage? The spa is not on site -- it's at a mall 15 miles away, far out of the 5-mile radius of the hotel's complimentary shuttle. The only way to get there is to rent a car or take the Sheraton shuttle -- for $65.00 round trip. Plus the shuttle (a towncar) maxes out at 4 people, so our party of 7 would've required 2. The sales and marketing director was atrocious and malicious as he later reported that our party had demanded 2 limos to take us to the spa. Limos? No. Demanded? How about asked you to live up to your website promises. Other than that, the hotel could use some major updates and is pretty much in the middle of no where. Most of all, it could use an overhaul of the staff. Never again."

King Size bed, small sofa and desk. It was well appointed and clean. The bathroom was larger than most and had granite vanity and tile flooring and tub surrounds. Closet space is double that of the Courtyard.Room service arrives in 15 min., so be ready!

Nor would I have if given the choice. The rooms were adequate, although I asked for a different one after checking in so I wasn't just staring at the rooftop. My king room was plenty spacious and nicely appointed with a comfy bed, but on closer inspection, it was pretty dated and several things were broken (lock on sliding door, button on phone to call front desk, clothes line in bathroom, outlet in bathroom that would barely hold my blow dryer plug.) All rooms are non-smoking, but you can still smell the stale evidence of it's smoking past. The pool area was uninspired but nice and the pool was sparkling clean. Sun on the pool area only in the morning hours -- it is in full shade all afternoon. Very fun looking waterslide separate from the pool, although I saw no one use it at all. Tennis courts right by pool. The conference facilities and service were quite good, although the food was just okay. Hotel restaurant had very limited, yet overpriced, choices. I didn't personally pay for my room, but the charge was $139 per night, which seemed reasonable. Location was less than appealing, with nothing handy within walking distance. There is a walking trail along a canal behind the hotel. Not too scenic, but at least there was somewhere to walk between meetings. Otherwise the area is very industrial and right next to the freeway. I never would have stayed here on my own. Not what you would expect from Sheraton."

After reading some of the more recent reviews, I almost canceled our reservation, but it was hard to beat my company's Hilton contract rate here. I figured if it was *that bad*, we would just switch somewhere else after one night. I have Hilton Gold status and they upgraded us to a Casita. A bellman escorted us to the room and helped carry our bags in. The Casita was nice enough though the look is rather dated. There is a stained-glass window over the staircase to the second floor, and no way to block the light coming in through this window. The bed was comfortable and the main bath was nice enough. Some have mentioned having poor cell phone coverage... there was only one place in the room where we didn't have a signal, overall that wasn't an issue.We were given free continental breakfast coupons and had breakfast one day at the Hole-in-the-Wall. As other reviews have mentioned, the food there was terrible and we didn't go back. Also the cell phone didn't really work in the restaurant.It was a little too chilly to enjoy the lazy river, though the water was warm and there were a few kids floating around. The whole resort had a rather empty feel during our stay, though the casitas seemed to be mostly occupied. The staff in the convenience store were really nice as well as at Rodeo Drive, and the concierge helped us decide where to go hiking one morning. We also liked that the small pools are open until 11 PM, and while they have a plethora of clean towels in the pool area, we couldn't figure out where to put the wet ones.We had a security issue where the back door to the casita (at the carport) wasn't closing properly. Even if it was closed, I could push it open! We called maintenance and they fixed it while we were out one day. While the door was indeed fixed, they left the other door to the unit slightly ajar when they left! We could have had stuff stolen out of the room. Thankfully nothing was, but it was beyond careless that they left the other door open upon completion (we are sure that we did not leave it open - it was obvious that maintenance was using that door while they were repairing the other one). When we called about this, they sent maintenance over rather than security...security eventually called.We found out too late that with Hilton Gold status we would have been able to use the gym for free -- the published day rate was $12. It looked like a nice gym.The location was good, the staff tried hard, and the upgrade was nice...but there are so many great properties in the Phoenix area, I'm not sure we would be in a hurry to head back."
"Review_11293","hotel_118","hotel_4612","Dec 2, 2008","Great Property We've stayed at this hotel several times over the last 5 years. Its a great property that the kids LOVE going to. Here are the highlights:Pros:-lots to do for the kids, mini golf, lazy river, large pool with waterfall-you need a car in Phoenix but the resort is fairly close to high end shopping-the hotel is well designed (but it takes a while to figure out) and allows you to park close to your room-the Coyote Camp is FABULOUS, say the kids, they've been to 40-50 hotels and they talked about Coyote Camp the most. Staff at the camp is wonderful and are the same from our visits 5 years ago.Cons:-no restaurants within walking distance -service in Cantina restaurant takes a long time (food is good)-service in Hole in the Wall restaurant is very SLOW-pool side service was inconsistent, good one day very slow the next (it didn't seem to matter if gave a generous tip either)We ate mostly off property but used the resort so service wasn't an issue.We've stayed in everything from casitas to normal rooms and everything has accomodated our family of four. (kids 79 yr old)All in all we love this property and will continue to go there until we buy our own place in Sun Valley."
"Review_11294","hotel_118","hotel_9515","Nov 25, 2008","Decent Hilton Property Stayed here for 5 nights to attend conference @ Biltmore. Tripadvisor reviews were negative for Biltmore so I opted for this property.Overall, a positive experience, some issues. First, the good points about this property. Plenty of free parking, good housekeeping staff, rooms were clean and the majority of the staff was friendly and helpful. Nice pool areas especially for families w/ young kids.The first night I was given a first floor room (queen) in North Pointe blgd. Not close to main lobby and room was not in great condition. Shower head was broken. I had asked for an upgrade as a faithful HH member but front desk said no rooms available which was contrary to bartender who told me 40% occupancy on Sunday?The remainder of stay was on the 3rd floor of South Pointe blgd, better room(king) overlooking pool area. Room was ok for a military rate but I would not pay more than that rate.An issue w/ front desk about a fax that was sent twice, but we were told initially was not received, manager quickly addressed problem and advised staffer was new an unaware of the fax log.Property has some maintenance issues, a set of elevators under repair for entire stay resulted in some waits. Blgds have some obvious wear issues, but saw work being done to correct and staff completing punch lists.Again it was a good experience for a reasonable rate."

The check in staff and staff in general were excellent!!! As I suggested before stay in the South Pointe as it has a nice pool for a late night swim and is a little nicer than the North Side. For families the River Ranch is the best. One note: I used to love the Whole in the Wall restaurant on site, but this time the food was not very good (maybe just a bad day). There is a Italian restaurant across the street in the Bank parking lot (sorry forgot the name) but it is excellent."
"Review_11297","hotel_118","hotel_9173","Nov 2, 2008","It's falling apart - time for the Hilton Group to update this property My husband had to stay in this hotel for 12 nights, owing to a business trip. I joined him for the last 5 nights before we headed off touring. Despite having a high level Hilton Honors priviledge card, he got a very ordinary room, surprisingly small compared to say the average high end motel room, and was told nothing else was available, when he checked in. They gave him a few complimentary vouchers for the cheapest breakfast available on site, instead. When he got to the room, it had yet to be serviced. Two days later, he returned to his room mid morning to get some papers he had left inside by accident. The keycard would not work. He ran to reception where it was reissued. It still didn't work. Long story, short - 5 maintenance staff members and 45 minutes later, he got access to the room. Of course, by now, he was extremely late for a meeting where he had to make a presentation. They gave him a $20 voucher for his inconvenience!!!!! The room was very tired - furniture scuffed and old fashioned, drapes faded, paintwork scratched, bathroom fixtures scoured until the base metal was exposed, that kind of thing. The desk was too small to do any work on and use a PC at the same time, it had an old-fashioned TV with a poor screen. Worse, the airconditioning was extremely noisy and the thermostat very insensitive. It turns itself off for long periods, then the fan comes on at maximum warp to cool the room down in a hurry, then runs a little more quietly before shutting off. This cycle is not conducive to a peaceful night's sleep.My first day, arriving jet-lagged from the UK, they had a water problem. I ended up having a cold shower in the morning, but there was NO water by 10.00 am. Guests were told they could use the facilities in the spa building, 5 minutes walk away. While the water was off, housekeeping 'did' the room. How you can clean a bathroom properly and hygienically without water, nobody ever managed to explain to my satisfaction. Further, there was evidence of remedial repair works going on around the accommodation blocks, and the nearest elevator to the room was out of order for the whole of my husband's 12 night stay.This hotel has a large pool and water activity based leisure facility. This is ideal for families with children and people wanting to relax and sunbathe. If you spend most of your time here, you will probably consider the property not bad. If you mostly just use the rooms, you are unlikely to be impressed. The best feature, to me, was a reasonably comfortable bed.While the front of house staff were polite and embarrassed at the shortcomings, and claimed they wanted to help with the problems we encountered, they didn't actually achieve much or offer anything positive or genuinely meaningful to alieviate the situation. The other staff members we encountered - housekeeping and ground staff - seemingly spoke little or no english and just put on a smile because they had been trained to do so. Not our usual Hilton experience."

"Review_11299","hotel_118","hotel_9778","Sep 22, 2008","Great Resort - Terrible Service and Professionalism The Resort advsertised many things such as Kids Eat free with paid adult meal, Covered Parking when renting the 2 story Casita's, Mini Bar. The Covered Parking, even though assigned to the room and included in the room rate is not a guarentee by the Resort. You will find this out after you check in and someone else is in your spot. If you want the mini bar function, Your key may or may not work. If it does not you will get lip service from the staff and never have access to the mini bar. If you complain about the parking more than twice they will humor you and send out security to look at the vechicle that is passed there. Be sure not to identify yourself as the customer who complained and you will find out what they really think about you. Normally a good deal of profanity in thier remarks. Dont even try to get the Kids eat free thing, It expired and even though you are told about it on check in and on the phone it is not real. Dont even try to bring up any issues at check out or use the room phone to call the front desk. You will be ignored, and basically told to go have a nice day. This Resort has plenty of Business and they dont need yours. I would not recommend anyone that would like to stay at a 4 or 5 star resort to stay at this one. You are lower than pond scum in the eyes of the Resort Managment and Staff."

We have stayed here before- 5 years ago; not much has changed, despite the remodelling!Our reasons for returning were the weather- UK has been s**te for the last 12 months, and we needed to relax and that last time, it wasn too bad!You can relax during the week, but Thursday pm through Sunday pm, dont even dream of peace and quiet- it is a resort and families do make the most of it!And dont make the mistake of thinking that when its busy, the resort might open the advertised water park earlier- it seems to be down to the discretion of the staff, which is random to say the least.Anyway, to be objective:Check in- was swift, but failed to identify or provide the appropriate vouchers for breakfast (identified as an issue on many reviews), and gave out of date value pack, which was worthlessRoom- no different from 5 years ago, although in the main block this time; Dusting is obviously a long forgotten art here, as is recognition of Diamond HH status- no benefit at all at this hotelRiver ranch- facilities good, but maintenance and consistency (water butts/cups etc,) hit and miss; Slim Pickens bar- you need it more than me budd! when leaving only $1 after having walked the length of the park, had a single beer poured and charged 拢5.50 for it! I Dont get the tipping thing when the guy/gal has done F all for it!!Breakfast- eventually having managed to get our entitled vouchers, we began to regret it!Food at the Lantana is a complete lucky dip, which fits perfectly with the service!Dont even worry about the time, just dont think about what is going to turn up- you order white toast, guaranteed its brown; scrambled eggs and bacon appeared as poached and sausages!One day, not even given a plate- I thought I'd just put yours on your husbands!Another day, seated at a table with no waiter at all taking responsibility for it! Had to coerce a guy to help us to get served!Lunch- DONT GO to the Hole in the Wall! Food crap, overpriced and thats even before they try to rook you later by adding 50%, which takes days to fight! keep your receipts! Seems that the Cowboys are still around, now just outlaws!Dinner- didnt take the chance- too risky!Positives:The weather is great, the pools are well maintained, and most of the staff are friendly, if not necessarily professional.Housekeeping staff are patient and thorough, except for dusting! and the Tocasierra gym was excellent, with helpful staff and good facilities.Cabs- obviously the hotel has a kick back from the cab company they use- its impossible to get a sedan, always an SUV at 10% more, but also more thn the cabs from the Ritz (from Hilton to Biltmore- $25, from Ritz at Biltmore to Hilton- $18!! Dont bother booking- 5 years ago, booked, failed to turn up; Same this time!Recomendations-Shop at Basha and enjoy balcony snacks, supported by happy hour snacks from Lantina grill; Go to Elements at the Sanctuary for a good meal- a little pricey but the service and quality dwarf anything near Squaw Peak .Manager of Lantina- have buffet guests in one area- they need little assistance other than drinks top ups, and have continental breakfast set up so that one person can supervise (if you are that untrusting), but for goodness sake, make sure that people are served within 30 minutes of seating and get the order right!!Or employ people that like their work!Sounds like a harsh review! Would we come back- probably not due to the complete lack of understandng of customer service and value, but maybe, because there were a few that made it worthwhile- Felipe, the gardener at the top pool, Sam at front desk, and Patti our housekeeper, the gym staff, and some others whose names we didnt catch- the manager at the water ranch, the guy who checked us in, and our waitress on our first and last days.Your money, your choice, but for unbeatable sun in Sept, its a no brainer; just get out of the hotel at the weekend when the invasion occurs!!"

"Review_11302","hotel_118","hotel_3490","Sep 13, 2008","Lovely suites The suites at the hotel are of a very good standard. Our children loved the lazy river and slides at the hotel. We stayed at the pool until closing time at 7pm. However, I would suggest you put on some insect repellent as we were quite badly bitten in the evening by the pool. We tried the on site restaurant. The food was terrible. My son had the fish and fries and it was seriously overcooked, almost dark brown batter. My older son had steak with broccoli. The steak was overcooked and the broccolli was so undercooked it flew acroos the room like a bullet when he cut into it. The hotel was full of noisy, small, children so I expect if you're not a family this is not the place to be. We didn't mind this as our children soon made friends. Overall the rooms were of a very good standard, but I would say don't bother eating here."
"Review_11303","hotel_118","hotel_4480","Sep 9, 2008","Worst Customer Service EVER!!! Upon check in there was a line out the door, they only had two people checking everyone in, when it was our turn it was a quick process, we got our keys and headed to our room. There are no inside corridors so that was a pain, but we were able to park right outside our building. The Luggage carts were chained to a fence so we had to call the front desk so they could send someone over to unlock them for us, very tacky as it was 100 + out and we just wanted to get into our room.We got to our smoke free room - finally...and it looked like it was recently remodeled, nice large rooms, and a bonus to have a separate bedroom from the living area. The room however smelled of old cigarette smoke (which I am highly allergic to), my guess is that at one time it was a smoking room. So thank goodness we brought Fabreeze with us and sprayed the entire room down, including the curtains (we had called the front desk and it sounded like that's all housekeeping would be able to do for us as well)The first morning we were there, we were awakened at 8:30 am by the front desk saying our credit card had been declined (how come we weren't notified upon check in), I knew this to be an error as I had PLENTY of room on my card...I told them I would call my bank and find out what was going on....upon talking with the credit card company the hotel had placed 5 authorizations on my credit card in the following amounts....$1183.00, $1183.00, $800.00, $600.00, and $500.00. They couldn't get my card to go through...NO WONDER, they froze up over $4,500.00 on my credit card, and anyone who knows anything about credit cards ( I worked in the banking industry for almost 10 years), when a company does an authorization it puts a hold on those funds for 5 -6 business days!!! until the charges are processed.So they maxed out my credit card. I called the front desk and they said that was impossible that that could not have happened, I told them, the $$$ amounts that the credit card company had told me they placed. I told them there is no way I would know the $$$ amounts if the money wasn't being held by them.To make a very very long story short, it took 4 hours that day to get it somewhat sorted out, my CC company told me I needed the Hilton to call them and remove all of the authorizations from my card, the front desk said they were not authorizations that my CC had been rejected those 5 times.It took 5 DAYS to get the messed cleared up and sorted out (funny how they had called my CC company and had those authorizations removed - but declined that that could happened), The hotel tried to tell us that our card was rejected at check in....I don't know about you but if it was rejected at the time of check in...1. Why would you give us keys?2. Notify us at check in that there was a problem with our card.3. Ask if we wanted to put our room on another card.If our credit card was rejected the above should never have happened and we should not have spent our whole 5 days dealing with getting their authorizations removed from our CC so we could continue our vacation. We demanded that they compensate us for all the time and frustration they caused us and ruining our vacation and they offered us a free lunch (we paid for breakfast in our package deal but did not get breakfast that first day because of dealing with this so they offered us lunch instead) and $40.00 additional, we told them that wasn't good enough, that we felt at least one nights stay (we stayed 5 nights) was more acceptable, finally after arguing in the lobby they offered us an additional $50.00.Upon check out, on our final bill that is slipped under the door, there was a $75.00 charge for dinner (which we did not make) and there was only a $40.00 credit. OK can you say EXTREMELY UPSET at the unprofessionalism of this staff. It took another HOURS to get the $75.00 removed that we DID NOT CHARGE for dinner and to get the additional $50.00 that they told us would be credited to us.WE WILL NEVER EVER STAY HERE AGAIN...we are telling everyone that this was the worst customer service we have ever received. We did a 5 week road trip across the United States and stayed at some of the nicest hotels with the best services and this was our last hotel before heading home, and it was the worst!"

The living room and kitchen with minifridge and microwave were a plus. The hotel itself is run down and the nicest restaurant on site was horrible. The pool area is fun, but I recommend it for kids older than 7. The gym was very small. The front desk staff was iffy. The hotel is in an older part of Phoenix with not much life and the Biltmore plaza is dated and was under construction when we visited.

We only live a mile from the property but our kids love the water park, and we love the suite sized rooms (400SF) with seperate bedroom and living area. You cannot beat the location if considering staying in the Phoenix area. This is close to downtown (5mi), Scottsdale Fashion Square (5mi), Biltmore Fashion Plaza (3mi), great hiking (Squaw Peak - 1mi, Camelback mountain - 2mi), and freeway (1mi). Seems there has been some remodelling in the rooms since our last stay, as rough texture on walls has been smoothed out (popcorn ceilings still present though). Also added shade coverings on the balconies, which really helps with the intense afternoon sun. We always stay in Pointe South (this is a big property with suites and cabanas, Pointe South is where the main lobby is, there is also Pointe North with a seperate pool) in a non-smoking suite, next to the pool, room 2362. This is a king bedroom, with queen sofa bed. We were really pleased with the room, as normally always get 2 queen beds (rooms are a little bigger). Room on the East side (less intense afternoon sun). Furnishings look new, and very comfortable. TVs both worked, and bed was very comfortable with nice soft sheets and pillows. My wife is allergic to down/feathers, and was no problem having comforter and pillows changed. We also checked in at 12pm (4pm normal checkin) and checked out at 1pm 2 days later, with no questions or hassles or extra fees. We spent a lot of time at the lazy river and water slide. My wife preferred to hang out in the room, and relax. We did not check out the gym, although usage was included in package. There is an 18hole mini-golf which I played with my daughter. Also 4 tennis courts (no idea of pricing). Internet access is $12.00/day (in-room) but have free wi-fi in the lobby (which seemed to work in the patio area that liked to sit in.We ate at the Hole in the Wall, mainly burgers, steaks and chicken. Sat on the patio first night, and was disappointed with number of flies. Food was okay (kids eat free a good deal), service was a bit slow, I seem to remember the same problem the previous year. This was a holiday weekend, but restaurant did not appear overly crowded, and not sure why it took 20 minutes from placing order to getting burger and fries. Made use of the buffet ($6.00/kids under 12) at lunch. Never ate at the Lantana grill, bit outside our price range. There are a number of good restaurants within 2 miles.  - Golden Dragon - very good Chinese, Northern/12th St (1mi)  - TexAZ grill - excellent BBQ, 16th St/Bethany Home (2mi).  - Sauce - modern Italian eatery - pizza/salad, Glendale/7th St - PeiWei - Asian food (PF Chang subsidiary), Glendale/7th St - Moto - Japanese, Glendale 16th St.  - Aunt Chilada's - Mexican, soft chips (opposite hotel) - Carlos Obrians - popular Mexican food 12th St/Northern - Paradise Bakery - 12th St/Glendale (good bread, sandwiches)Fast food: - MacDonalds - 16th St/Glendale (0.5mi) - Subway - 16th St/Glendale (0.5mi) - NY Pizza - 12th St/Northern (0.5mi) - Stumpey's Pizza - 12th St/Glendale (deliver) - Papa Johns - 16th St/Glendale (deliver) - Pizza Hut - 16th St/Bethany Home (deliver) - Starbucks - 16th St/Bethany Home Grocery: - Bashas - 16th St/Glendale - Safeways - 7th St/GlendaleThere were a lot of people at the property but never felt too crowded, and swimming pools were kept very clean. I was a little suprised at how relaxed everyone was with the rules (lazy river and water slide). Maybe it is the end of the season, but in previous years were very strict on height for water slide and making sure used a tube on the lazy river.  Hiking at Squaw Peak, 2mi to parking, 1.25mi 1000ft climb. Very popular hike, good parking. Get there early on weekends. Can also hike at Dreamy Draw Park which is on the North side of Squaw Peak, lots of trails, and easy 1mi drive from hotel. Camelback mountain, 3mi to parking. 1.25mi 1200ft climb. Two routes, East and West. Recommend West route, but limited parking at Echo Canyon, more parking 0.6mi away. Get there early on weekends.North Mountain. More gentle, can even take the paved road to thetop. 7th St/Peoria, near Pointe Tapiteo (2mi). Cons: I got home and checked my bank account, and see a $360.00 deduction pending from my account from Hilton hotels (Hilton manage the Pointe hotels - there are three Pointe South Mountain, Pointe Tapiteo, and Pointe Squaw Peak). I knew my bill was only $283.00. I call and am politely told they put a hold on the hotel rate plus $50.00/day for incidentals, and should be credited back within 72hours of departure. Okay, how about informing me they plan to do this. Not experienced this before, and am a little upset this was not presented at checkin."
"Review_11306","hotel_118","hotel_8958","Aug 29, 2008","Great place for the family with excellent access to Phoenix I travel over 100k/yr for work and expect the best in service and quality. For our family vacation to Sedona and the Grand Canyon, I picked the Hilton Squaw peak based on location and amenities provided by the hilton website.Overall, this is a great hotel for the family. Free parking, 3 different pools, with a waterfall, slide and lazy river makes this an excellent location for a family with young kids. 2 restaurants onsite, a gift shop/ice cream parlor, a bar, a kid's camp, mini golf and tennis courts makes a stay here lots of fun.Rooms - we stayed in the north pointe (3 sets of buildings + villas) on the 4th floor in a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds. Overall, we were happy with the state of the room. It was clean, beds were comfortable, shower pressure was more than adequate and 2 tv's makes it easy to entertain the kids during the downtime between pool and diner.Parking - ample, free parking throughout.Service - excellent. Everyone is courteous and helpful. No attitude from anyone during our stay.Restaurants - hole in the wall is good but a little pricey. We ate there twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner. Food is quite good. Our kids ate free (for breakfast) which is nice (I believe it is only until labor day though as part of a summer special). The BBQ is tasty and the portions are large.Lantana canteen- not impressed. We went there one morning for breakfast. Hostess was nowhere to be found, service was sporadic and the continental breakfast was mediocre. We never ate there for dinner, so I can't comment on the quality.Spa and health club - I am a runner but didn't do any exercise on this trip (unless you count downing margerita's). I heard the health club is of professional quality, so I suspect it would meet the needs of most exercise seekers.The hotel is conveniently located near several of the freeways without being right beside them. We had no trouble getting to activities from the hotel and the airport was a 15 min drive.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially families with young kids."

In particular we picked it because of the swimming pools, and these were good, we all enjoyed the lazy river, and the kids liked the slide. In August it was really, really hot, so we definitely needed the pool to cool off in.We arrived early afternoon and luckily could get into our rooms immediately. The rooms were really big, with a separate lounge area, fridge and coffee making facilities. We ate in the Lantana Grill and the food was really good, not sure why but the restaurant was almost empty apart from us, but the staff were very attentive - although there was a thunderstorm going on! We had breakfast in the Hole in the Wall Restaurant, which was also good, particularly as it was complimentary.Would recommend this hotel for families, and if ever passing through Phoenix again, we would stay here."
"Review_11308","hotel_118","hotel_1735","Aug 13, 2008","We'd Go Back I was a little worried after reading some reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. Pools - We went to the water park on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, Thursday was fine but Friday was a little too crowded with kids. We moved to the North Pool and had it almost to ourselves until a mob of 20 bratty kids came in. Even with the bratty kids we still enjoyed ourselves, you CAN bring your own floats in the pools(and lazy river) along with drinks to the pools outside of the water park. Holel - We stayed in one of the half-suites for $89/night and it was more than adequate. It had a king-sized bed(extremely comfortable), a shower  tub with the vanity outside of the bathroom and a fridge in the closet. There was a stinky smell coming from the sink but that was a minor issue. Nice flat screen on the wall. I do agree with other posters that you can really hear your neighbors, but that didn't bother us too bad.Restaurants - After reading the reviews on here we skipped the restaurants. We walked in the Hole In the Wall for breakfast on Friday morning and left after noone acknowledged us after 10 minutes. We were impressed with the pina coladas at the hotel bar; beer and drinks prices were average for a resort. We ate at Gallaghers Sports Bar (right off the property) twice and it was average bar food, nothing spectacular. I do highly recommend Barrios Cafe, a mexican restaurant on 16th that was fantastic - the area is a little shady, but the chicken enchiladas were worth it. Staff- Concierge was very nice and helpful. We tried calling the front desk several times from our room at different times and couldn't get through. When checking in the girl knew nothing, didn't explain where our room was. There are guys on golfcarts roaming the property that will help you, but they expect a hefty tip in exchange.Overall, there was definitely more good than bad - I'd recommend this hotel with families looking for a nice getaway. There are also some cute feral kitties that visited us each morning, if you see them toss them out some treats."

I had spent a lot of time researching various hotels in the Phoenix area and settled on the Squaw Peak because it appeared to be quite kid friendly from what we read, including the reviews on TripAdvisor. Our kids, aged 8,10 and 14 had a great time. The lazy river and pools were a big hit, especially with our younger kids. The check in process went smoothly (we booked through United Vacation.com and got a great deal on the lodging as well as the flight from Denver) and we were given one of the standard rooms with a bedroom with 2 queens and a separate living area with a foldout sofa. When we checked in we were told to check back in a couple days about a possible upgrade. I did check back, and we did receive a room upgrade on about our third day at the resort. The upgraded room was a two story casita, with plenty of room for our family of five to spread out. Much nicer than the standard room.We stayed a total of 9 nights at the resort and truly enjoyed it. We had been concerned that the heat would be unbearable but as it was Phoenix was blessed with a few days of relatively cooler weather in late May before it started to warm up, gradually. Didn't really matter to us as we spent a lot of time around the pools.The breakfasts at Lantana Grille and the Hole in the Wall at the River Ranch were pretty good. We tended to go off-resort for other meals - there are some decent places to eat quite close to the resort. We did do dinner at the Hole in the Wall one evening but the service was terrible - in fact my wife and kids got tired of waiting for the food and left - we ended up eating it in our room.I used the fitness facilities at the Tocasierra Fintness Center a number of times and found it satisfactory, with plenty of equipment - although a couple of the treadmills were not very stable. My wife and eldest daughter also indulged with spa treatments, and although somewhat pricey, they did find them enjoyable.The River Ranch was the big hit of our vacation, and there was never a problem finding lounge chairs, towels, etc. - although getting service at your lounge chair on the weekend days can be a bit frustrating due to the volume of people.We also took the free shuttle over to the Tapatio Cliffs resort on a couple occassions. The main pool area at that resort is also quite nice, and I found the bar area actually a little livlier. The fact that we could use the facilities of both resorts is a real plus in my mind.I travel quite a bit both domestically and internationally, and while the Squaw Peak is a nice place, with decent amenities and mostly very good service, I would not rate it a premier resort. That said the value for money was excellent."

Only complaint: it was beyond hot the whole week but the pools were warm! It was like taking a bath; we swam at night but it wasn't very refreshing. On our last night we heard that one of the pools on the other side of the property was much cooler but it was too late to check it out."
"Review_11312","hotel_118","hotel_1888","Jul 30, 2008","Need's some TLC Spent a couple of days with the Grand Kids and over all had a good time. The water park kept the boy's busy for most of the day and kept us out of what was a old tired room. The facility itself was good, the staff and every employee we needed to encounter treated us with respect. Spending a lot of time in the water park I did notice some problems and the first being people being there that had no business being there, my impression was that only guest that were book at the hotel are allowed to use the water park. Over all I would recommend this hotel for people with kids who need to burn off some energy but would think twice if I were staying there alone or as a couple. The room we were in was outdated with 60's decor and some carpeting that was suspect at best."
"Review_11313","hotel_118","hotel_8542","Jul 26, 2008","Not quite ideal... Stayed in a two-bedroom casita at the resort for a several day conference held there. The casita was in need of updating, had a musty smell, and my colleague and I had to call maintenance the first night because the carpet outside the downstairs bathroom was wet and there was a dripping noise. They concluded that the previous guests had probably left a leaky cooler there and brought in a noisy fan we let run overnight- it was there for the rest of our stay. The resort is sprawling- not ideal for people attended a conference who want to pop into their rooms in between sessions. The conference facilities were great other than the 3rd floor (rooftop) rooms, which were way too warm. The restaurants are OK, but the more casual of the two is certainly overpriced. The pool areas are lovely, but service all over the property is lacking. I gave it an above average rating simply because of the availability of the pool complex."
"Review_11314","hotel_118","hotel_1461","Jul 24, 2008","The worst Hilton we've ever stayed at My husband and I just got back from a two week trip including Sedona, the Hopi Reservation, Durango, Co, and Phoenix. We are HiltonRewards members and used out points to stay at the Hilton in Sedona (fabulous), the DoubleTree in Durango, (wonderful), and the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort in Phoenix...not so much.First of all, the air didn't work - it was 112 when we got there. Nothing was ever done. Second, we had ANTS...everywhere. The blinds didn't work and the housekeeper kept moving our things around to where she wanted them. The resort itself seemed run down. The pictures made it look much larger than it is. A professional miniature golf course winds around the lazy river at River ranch and inner tubes covered the whole golf course. We, along with several other people couldn't even follow where the holes were. One minute you were on top of a hill, and the next minute you had to cross over a hole someone else was playing to get to your next hole. While we were there, they also had an adolescent basketball conference. Banging of doors, yelling, running up and down the stairs, and yes, one night some kids tried to break into our room. Unfortunately, I was in it! I chased them down the corridor and made sure they understood I didn't find their attempts funny. All, in all, not the most relaxing time. I must say, however, that the HIlton in Sedona was absolutely fantastic, as was the DoubleTree in Durango, Co. My husband and I have stayed at Hiltons for years and the Squaw Peak resort was the worst Hilton we've ever stayed at."
"Review_11315","hotel_118","hotel_2660","Jul 22, 2008","Not all it's cracked up to be So, I decided for my birthday, I wanted to go away (but not out of town) for a weekend. I picked the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak because it claimed to have some really good deals for a pretty decent price. Well, let me tell you - going to a resort in the off season, is not all it's cracked up to be! When we checked in, the staff were NOT friendly, no one offered any help with baggage, and they did not give us the coupon book we were supposed to get or our $50 dinner coupons. Our room was okay, but the shower/tub did not drain. Our neighbors were packed about 20 to a room and there were constantly huge bags of garbage sitting out in front of their door. None of the elevators worked (we were on the 3rd floor) and none of the ice machines worked. The pool areas were nice enough - of course, when we got there, we couldn't get tubes for the lazy river because the pump to blow them up was broken. It just seemed like everything was broken or out of order. When we asked the person at the front desk about the coupons we never got and the dinner vouchers, he was completely unhelpful and pretty much told us, Sorry 'bout it - it was your responsibility. No, actually is wasn't my responsibility, I don't work there!! So, if you're planning on staying here, you might want to reconsider - the staff are not very friendly, and definitely do not feel they should go out of their way to accomodate you. I can say that both nights we ate at the Lantana Grille lounge and the food was very good and our server was an absolute joy! But we probably will not stay here again - or advise anyone else to stay here."

There are several swimming pools, which makes it nice for children of any age. I traveled with my 8 and 3 year olds, and they felt safe throughout the property.We hired a Town Car to and from the airport ($30 each way), then rented a nice Toyota for a couple of days from the on-site Beverly Hills Rental Car (competitive rates - no need to wait in line at the airport). Food prices and food were OK - one child eats free with adult entree purchase, and you can expect resort prices. There is a grocery store and pharmacy about half a mile from the resort - stock up on goods there.Free shuttle service to the other Pointe Hilton resort. That one had tremendous views of the city, but the famed Different Point of View restaurant was closed when we went.Downsides? Only a small mini-bar fridge in the room. We didn't see a concierge until the day we left. The building itself was not really all that impressive.Overall - great value."
"Review_11317","hotel_118","hotel_10542","Jul 7, 2008","Perfect for the family ! We live only a few blocks from this resort so my neighbors and I took advantage of the summer rates and booked a Casita that included two bedrooms (2 queens and 1 king) and a downstairs (livingroom, dining, kitchen, powder room, etc..). We had 6 adults and three kids. Plenty of room for all. The kitchen came with a half size fridge so we could store drinks, food, etc... and not have to pay the resort prices all the time. The casita was nice and located on a little street that resembled a real neighborhood with the houses, tree lined streets and carports. This weekend over the 4th of July was very popular and the number of guests must have been approaching capacity. However, the number of seperated pool areas, restaurants, activity areas spread everyone out so no single area was overcrowded. Everyone had a very nice time, especially the little ones.The main pool could use a bit of a face lift but that is the only thing that needed some improvement.The service was excellent. I think they must have required everyone on the payroll to work that weekend as there were staff constantly running somewhere doing something. Towels were always stocked, food service was served hot and with as smile, staff members regularly asked if there was anything else the could do, the rooms were cleaned well and on time, we all felt very well taken care of.I would certainly return to this resort in the future and give it 4 stars (above average)."

"Review_11319","hotel_118","hotel_5739","Jun 24, 2008","Decent property, not great for business travelers Stayed in the Hilton Squaw Peak for a week on a business stay, and thought it was a decent looking property, but not at all set up to my unique needs as a business traveler.- The property is really spread out: it is a car ride or five minute walk to get from registration to my room, and another walk to the gym or pool.- No concierge lounge: if you want to have a breakfast and are used to hotels having a concierge lounge for Diamond VIP travelers, you'll have to go to the restaurant and be seated, which is a lot slower when you just need to grab and go.- Gym closes early: it runs from 5am until 8:30, which just doesn't work for me as I often want to work out after 9 or 10pm after a long day of work or after dinner.- No lap pool: there is a pool large enough to do laps, but I tried to enter at 5:30am and they said it doesn't open until 8am. Again does not work for the schedule of a business traveler.So the hotel may work for you if you are on vacation with your family, but as I spend many nights a year in a hotel, this hotel lacks the basic amenities that I look for in a hotel to meet my needs for convenience and exercise."

The rooms are nice and spacious, and the grounds were clean. There were always clean towels available at the pools. Housekeeping was timely and did a good job of keeping our room tidy. Check in and Check out were easy. My only recommendations to the hotel would be to offer free high speed internet connections and possibly consider putting microwaves and/or minifridges in the rooms. We were so pleased we will be back for future vacations. I would highly recommend this resort to families with children of all ages as there is a toddler pool, a water slide, and two bigger pools to choose from."
"Review_11321","hotel_118","hotel_6269","Jun 20, 2008","Nice Stay Overall I was traveling as a single woman, and found this hotel more than satisfactory on most counts. I stayed in South Pointe, and was a little nervous about using the elevator at night because the lighting was so poor both from the parking area and, especially, up on the 4th floor. I hope they will consider improving the lighting as soon as possible.As for my suite, I couldn't have been more comfortable. Even the prints on the walls were interesting and atttractive. I felt pampered with the bedding, the furniture, and my own living room. Early in the morning, I enjoyed the canopy view of the tree-tops from my balcony, and even took some pictures of the birds in the trees.The water park was awesome!! Even grown-ups without kids were enjoying the pools and the lazy river. The big pool with the waterfall was wonderful, and you could quickly cool off under that.Prices at the Slim Pickens Grill were rather high - $16 for a hot dog and a pina colada smoothie, but it was convenient. The Hole in the Wall restaurant was very good. I had a nice dinner of ribs (mouth-watering), with the best biscuits I've had in a long time. Breakfast was also good, and the staff was very friendly.The conciege was very helpful, and had printed-out directions for the Heard Museum and the Car Rental Return at the airport. The location of the hotel made it easy to travel anywhere in the area.All in all, I had a great stay, and would definitely return again someday."
"Review_11322","hotel_118","hotel_2438","Jun 17, 2008","The Good and the Bad Stayed here on Friday and Saturday night over Father's Day weekend with my wife and two children, ages three and eight. First the good:1) The recently-completed renovations are beautiful. The guest rooms are spacious, modern, clean and well-appointed. The grounds are very nice.2) The check-in process was smooth and efficient and the front desk clerk was very friendly. A bellman offered to take our luggage and show us to our room.3) The water park was great! The main pool, lazy river, jacuzzi and tad pool (for the wee ones) were fun and the kids and I had an awesome time.Now the bad:Food service is atrocious at this resort. Nearly every experience we had with food was a bad experience. From poor service, long wait times and poor food quality, the food and beverage department at this resort needs a major overhaul.For example, we went to breakfast at the Hole In The Wall on Saturday morning and had the breakfast buffet. The eggs were powdered, the biscuits were rock hard (inedible), the bacon was hard, dry and chewy, etc. Not very good.On Saturday evening for room service, we ordered the special Family Summer Splash Pizza, Salad, Wings and Soda combo, at a cost of over $43. It took over an hour for the food to arrive, the pizza was luke warm, the wings had been burnt and had black spots on them, the salad for four was actually only enough lettuce for one adult, and the room service attendant made no effort to apologize for any delay. I ended up calling the room service line and asking for more salad, which I got.On Sunday morning, I went to the gift shop to get a cup of Starbucks coffee. When I pumped it out of the airpot, it was lukewarm. When I asked if they had a microwave to warm it up in, I was told there wasn't one in the gift shop and that if I wanted hot, fresh coffee, I should go to the lobby where they might have some there. It was only after I complained about the coffee not being hot or fresh that the lady offered to brew another pot.These are just a couple of examples of the problems with the food service at this resort. Which is too bad because the rest of the resort is absolutely worth the money. We got a special $123 per night local summer rate, and I know there are rates as low as $79 per night during the week.The only other issue was the high number of summer teen employees working there that didn't seem too interested in anything other than running around together and having a good time. I encountered several, at various times throughout my stay, that ran past me, one that ignored my request for information (he just looked at me as he walked past and never responded) and another that didn't know what hours the tennis courts were open till and didn't offer to find out.Despite these issues, I would recommend this resort, and do plan to return with my family, but will be keeping a close eye on the food service and may even go out to restaurants off of the resort grounds to eat while there."

Nothing really stood out.As it was bank holiday in America, the hotel was packed full of people, and out rooms had to be moved, so they upgraded us to 'Palacio del Este' which was abesolutely georgous. The service is outstanding, but the hotel in general was poor. The River Ranch was full and there were a school full of kids going there on a trip, which i found abesolutely outrageous as its a hotel not a theme park!I would reccomend going to eat at 'Gallahers' opposite the hotel, which is a sports bar. The Fasion square mall and Chandler mall are also great."

Room service is quick and decent. Location is good for business as the hotel is right off the highway, 10 minutes from downtown Phoenix and 5 minutes from the Camelback/Biltmore area. It can be a good value mid-week during the non-peak season offering business travelers an alternative to a standard hotel room."
"Review_11325","hotel_118","hotel_5854","May 24, 2008","This Was a Good Value We stayed in the main building at the Squaw Peak for three days in April, and took advantage of a Spring special at $99/night (Sunday night stay required). At this rate, the resort was a very good value. It shows some age on the exterior courtyards, and should not be considered a true luxury property. But our double queen suite was very nicely furnished and quiet. The concierges and other staff were quite positive in their approach to guests.This would be a good place for a vacation with kids, as the free water park includes several large pools, a waterfall, and one of the longest lazy rivers we've ever seen. Each of the buildings also has its separate pool. Another plus for me was that the hotel is very close to the Arizona Canal, which is a great place to run or bike. One negative is that this hotel, unlike the other Pointe Hilton resorts in the area, does not have a gourmet restaurant. Its two restaurants are just average. The service at one of the restaurants at breakfast was so bad that I complained to the manager and we got our meal free. The other restaurant (at the water park) was fine for breakfast. However, there are numerous excellent restaurants within a 10-15 minute drive from the hotel.Overall, a bargain for the price and it still would have been OK at a higher price."
"Review_11326","hotel_118","hotel_8118","May 22, 2008","Great Place for Families I have stayed at this property twice, and in fact we are going back this weekend. The main appeal is that it is family friendly, has child care (a day camp) on site and also the nice water park. Most of the rooms have been renovated, except they left the popcorn ceilings. Another nice feature is the separate bedroom in the suites. The outside of the property feels dated circa 1970's, but it is solid, large and quiet. I never had a problem with noise. One tip: get a courtyard view room in the FRONT of the North bldg. it overlooks a pretty pool and fountain and is quieter than the South bldg. the pool also gets mostly adults.This is not the best hotel for a romantic getaway, but if you have kids and want to have fun, it's great. The food is fine--not gourmet but fine. the only thing I did not like was no Wifi-you have to pay $12 per 24 hours for Internet service, which I find tacky. For those without kids or wanting a more upscale feel try the Pointe Hilton South Mtn or for really intimate, The Palms resort in Scottsdale."

I stayed at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak May 1-3 on a business trip and was able to book a low pre-pay rate thru the Hilton website. Upon check-in, I was upgraded from a king room to a king Casita since I'm a Hilton Diamond member. The first Casita they gave me smelled old and musty and looked very dated so I called the front desk to see if I could get a casita that didn't smell. They switched me to a newly renovated Casita which was leaps and bounds better than the initial one I had. New, contemporary furnishings, flat screen TV, new carpet, updated bathrooms-granite countertops, etc. Great view of the mountains from the upstairs bedroom. I really liked having a covered parking space-almost like a garage to keep your car out of the hot sun. The pools are terrific and the property is beautiful. I found the property to be very quiet and it felt like we were miles away from the city even though the airport and downtown Phoenix are both about 15 minutes away w/o traffic. The staff at Hole in the Wall was very friendly and eager to please. Good breakfast there too. I really hope to be able to return to this hotel again soon.

This would be a great place for a meeting but is not much of a resort. My room was off in the middle of nowhere, in a bland hotel wing near nothing. The restaurants were nothing special though they did offer a small variety of food and it did not seem difficult to get a table anywhere.I walked over to the central part of the resort which centers around a waterpark and that seemed to appeal to families so I would recommend for that. The spa was uninspired, and a bit pricey.I may be a bit jaded because I spent the earlier part of the week at the Wigwam which was a lovely resort with food so good I could dream about it!"

There were plenty of parking spaces in front of the building, but no elevator which left me hauling my luggage up the steps. The room had some signs of wear and tear, but was very clean. The mini-bar was well stocked but expensive (I suggest stopping at a grocery and picking-up whatever you will need). I liked the bathroom layout (shower/toilet on one side with door and sink/vanity on the other). The robe provided was light and comfortable. My balcony overlooked the dumpsters and service area, but I soon was accustomed to listening to the hotel employees conversing below (some of it was very entertaining). The first evening I walked to The Falls Water Village and enjoyed the sunset while having fish tacos for dinner (these tacos are amazingly delicious). The staff was very accomodating and professional. The following morning I made my way to the fitness room (be sure to refer to your map before leaving the room). The fitness room is like a small gym (very well equipped). Breakfast at Pointe In Tyme was nice with great service. After my meetings I visited the adult pool (great feature - no kids running and splashing - just peace and quiet with comfortable lounge chairs). Room service that evening was timely and delicious.

After reading some reviews, I was a bit nervous, but upon arrival, we found the resort to be in great shape and our room had been recently renovated. The main pool was a lot of fun, and although our kids weren't with us, we really enjoyed the lazy river, slide and pools. Everything is convenient. My only complaint was lack of breakfast options, but it wasn't a big deal. The website had said the room had a refrigerator, but the fridge was actually the mini bar stocked with items. We did notice some areas that needed repair, such as large missing pieces from the side of the pool in places, paint needed, etc. It's an older resort, but the landscaping was nicely maintained. We enjoyed the central location and spent a lot of time in Scottsdale.

We went down to Phoenix for the weekend on April 18-20 to escape the unseasonably cold weather in Oregon and I booked this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. It was definitely a GREAT place to stay for a quick getaway. For $150/night, it included nice amenities. We had a suite in the main building and it was nice and clean. We also loved the River Ranch where you can just float down the river in inner tubes, swim, just lay out by the pools, go down the waterslide, or eat/drink. We just hung out around the different pools all weekend and just went out for dinner/shopping in the evenings. It also had quick and easy access to the freeway and we were pretty central to everywhere we wanted to go. I also like that it's not a massive property where it takes forever to get to your room/food/pool. It's just the right size. We're expecting a baby this year and although it was a great place for just the 2 of us, it's an even better place for kids. We plan on coming back there every year as an annual tradition, especially with kids."
"Review_11334","hotel_118","hotel_7776","Apr 27, 2008","Nice Place but not as advertised. We stayed here over our Spring Break 4/13 through 4/20, with my husband and 2 children ages 8 and 10.Upon arrival, check in was quick and easy. I asked for a first floor room with a pool view but even though I requested 4 mos. prior they could not accommodate. We had a 3rd floor room with partial view of the pool. The rooms were perfect for a family. Two very comfortable queen beds, separated by a pocket door from the bathroom/toilet area, then doors again which separated the living area. This was perfect to put kids to bed and we could still watch tv. Also, my husband the snorer was kicked out into the living area/pull out couch so the rest of us could sleep and we never heard him.The balcony is so small and awful view, we didn't sit out there even once. I knew there was no refrigerator so we purchased a cooler at Walgreens right down the street and bought milk, juice, cereal and fruit so we didn't have to waste time or money going out to breakfast in the morning. We bought a big cooler and then just sent it home as luggage on the way home.The resort is very nice, well kept and beautiful. Very large palm trees and beautiful flowers. The pool area is also nice. The water temp was cool and several adults were complaining that it would have been nice to have it a few degrees warmer (it may have been 78 degrees or so). The water slide was very fast and the kids loved it. My kids also enjoyed the putt putt, though some of the holes could use a lift. We all played tennis one morning an d that was fun too. My major complaint about this place is that, I booked it due to the multitude of organized kids activities so that my husband and I could relax some. Apparently Spring Break had just ended in AZ so they scaled back on what they offered. There was a board posted at every hotel area indicating there would be pool activities every day at 10, 11, 1, 3, and 5 which included races, basketball games, water volley ball, slide races, watermelon eating contests, hoola hoop contests etc. Well we were there for seven days and there were two hoola hoop contests and one slide race. (that was it for the week). We continuously asked the pool staff when the next activity would be. They just had excuse after excuse. I realize Spring Break ended for them but the vacationers were on their Spring Break. My kids were very good at keeping themselves busy but after a few days it would have been nice if someone could have organized some activities for the kids. Even though I loved this place, this really irked me!!!!!We ate at the Hole in the Wall, very mediocre and pricey. The food at the pool was pricey. However, an adult sandwich was chock full of meat and kept all of us happy well until dinner. Most sandwiches were $9. Beers were $5 and up and mixed drinks around $8.We walked to Aunt Chiladas one night which was very good. Also Gallaghers across the street (pub food), sports bar which was good. Lantana Grille was very good. There are two hotel courtyards each with a pool and swim up bar. Both swim up bars were closed the whole week (also weird and disappointing), We enjoyed using these pools later in the day which was much quieter than the water park and very comfy chairs. AS there was no service here, we just packed a cooler and brought our own drinks,.No night life here to speak of. IN the past we have done an all inclusive vacation, where there is entertainment at night and then the adults sit around and socialize a bit. There was none of that here. The resort was quiet by 9:00.The fitness room is fantastic. New modern equipment, classes offered, it couldn't have been better.We went to the Grand Canyon one day and made it in 3 1/2 hrs. . Cut through Flagstaff and it shaves a little of the trip. Also went to Sedona one day. Awesome!! You have to do the Pink Jeep Broken Arrow tour as everyone says. Pricey but well worth it.All in all a good trip. The staff at the front desk and concierge could not have been better. Due to the lack of activities though I will probably go somewhere else next time."
"Review_11335","hotel_118","hotel_1589","Apr 20, 2008","nice experience with only a couple flaws We stayed in a studio room nestled among larger casitas for our anniversary. Note that almost all of the rooms at the Pointe are suites, but a few like ours are not. Though small, we really enjoyed our room. The room was clean, the bed was fluffy and soft, and the location of our room was in a quiet area away from most of the traffic. One thing you may want to consider is that quarters are tight in the shower, and tall people may have a problem with this. Unlike the casitas, the studios do not have an assigned parking spot. We didn't have a problem though since there are some open spots you can use. Overall we really enjoy staying here because of the comfortable rooms and the beautiful grounds."
"Review_11336","hotel_118","hotel_9676","Apr 18, 2008","Great location The best thing about this hotel is where it is located in Phoenix. I stayed as a business traveler who needed easy accessibility to downtown during the time. BUT, as a former Phoenician, it also gave me great access to all the things I loved about living in Phoenix: the Biltmore shopping area, Scottsdale Fashion Square, Camelback and Squaw Peak. It is enough out of the way to give you the resort feel, but still in the midst of everything. Although I enjoyed my stay, some business travelers may find that this hotel is a little too family-oriented for them. I was there during the last week of spring training and it was P-A-C-K-E-D. However, I was still able to enjoy the property. As a business traveler, it is important to me to be able to maintain a fitness routine. The Hilton Squaw Peak has a very nice fitness center and I didn't ever find it to be too crowded at peak evening hours. I was told that it was recently updated, so everything was in great shape. (Only suggestion I have for the hotel: balance your treadmills...a few were a bit wobbly on their legs!) Plenty of cardio machines and an extensive weight lifting area. Pretty great! Not to mention that you have access to Squaw Peak trails which is a nice bonus for the months when it is cool enough to be outside.The rooms are also quite large, which is great for being able to spread out. I had a suite on the ground floor near the pool / lobby. Even though there were lots of families who were up late, I didn't find it to be a distraction in my room. I also liked that my unit had a patio - which again, is great if it is cool enough to be outside. Thanks for a pleasant stay."
"Review_11337","hotel_118","hotel_7281","Apr 5, 2008","Top Notch Customer Service  We spent a week at Squaw Peak over Spring Break. The service was absolutely impecable. Despite the hotel being COMPLETELY PACKED (sold out w/ every room having families of at least 3 kids each!!), the staff remained positive, patient and friendly. I was very satisfied w/ the room lay-out. EVERY room is a suite and for a family, this is ideal!! When one person woke early or wanted to stay up late, there was a seperate room to accomodate that...really makes for a more comfortable stay!! On a negative note, the resort layout is rather cramped. When you add the crowds of Spring Break, it really was pushing it. The lazy river looked like a rush hour traffic jam! Overall, it was a great trip. I'd like to specifically mention the top notch fitness club. It was clean, modern and the staff were great!! Fitness Director, Keene was our guide on a hotel sponsored hike. He was great!! Kind, fun and professional...what more do you want in an employee!! Bottomline...this is a really great hotel, but be prepared for crowds at peak times. Maybe the crowds mean this hotel is doing something right!!"
"Review_11338","hotel_118","hotel_7407","Mar 28, 2008","Fairly Nice Resort We recently stayed at the Pointe Hilton, and have stayed there, quite a few times. We enjoy going to the water park. They could use some help there, because the service is slow. If you want to get some decent chairs, you need to get out there early. People do reserve their chairs with towels, although there is a sign, saying not to do that.We ate breakfast at the Hole in the Wall twice, and the food is not the best. Being gold members, we get 2 free continental breakfasts and we upgraded to bacon and eggs. You can upgrade to the buffet for $5. Make a reservation if you want to eat there.We got upgraded to a king casita, which is nice, although the 2 queen casita is nicer. It has a door upstairs into the room, where as the king casita does not. So you can hear the TV going downstairs. And the sleeper sofa has a thin mattress and it is very uncomfortable. My 8 year son didn't mind it though.We will go back to this hotel, but I would like to see a few improvements."
"Review_11339","hotel_118","hotel_7341","Mar 26, 2008","Good, but not GREAT experience We -- two adults and a near-teen -- visited Squaw Peak at the height of the spring break/spring training season, so it was packed. For the most part, we had a great time, but there were some annoying gaps in service/quality.The hotel is all suites (although small with no fridge), most seem to have been done over very nicely, with very comfortable beds and solid quiet construction. But if you have a bad back, get three people to help you unfold the fold-out couch!The River Ranch water complex was great, with mulitple pools, tennis, fairly boring miniature golf, and faux lazy river and waterslide (with great smoothies at the pool bar). However, at opening time, there was a long line of people waiting to get in, and the gate was understaffed. Concierge staff was incredibly knowledgable and helpful (thank you, Dave, Joan and Carol), with good advice on trips to Sedona and local sites and restaurant choices.The biggest disappointment was the on-property dining, which was mediocre and overpriced. We had opted for the bounce-back breakfast. The vouchers covered only a couple of menu items. The staff at both the family oriented Hole in the Wall and the fancier Lantana Grill kept trying to direct us to the pricey breakfast buffet. At the Hole in the Wall it was awful -- soggy french toast, cold eggs, a few pastries -- more like school cafeteria than good resort. (We DID love the Joshua Stone Band, local bluegrass group that plays Friday nights... worth seeing)The Lantana buffet was better, but more expensive... we would strongly recommend not buying the breakfast plan, and visiting some good local spots, like the 5  Diner nearby.It was annoying that while there was free wi-fi in the lobby, internet access everywhere else was an add-on.All in all, we had a great time... this is NOT a luxury resort, despite the pix, but a middle of the road family resort with nice rooms and a laid back atmosphere... just fix the restaurants!!!!"
"Review_11340","hotel_118","hotel_1940","Mar 12, 2008","A perenial favorite This is the 8th year in a row we have stayed at the Squaw Peak. It is an annual favorite for my boys and me. The rooms are comfortable, the beds comfortable, and the grounds are great. For kids, the pools, lazy river and the water slide are tops. Hours and hours of fun. I do agree with one of the other reviewers, the Squaw Peak is beginning to look a little tired around the edges. The service is still great. I will say, the food prices on campus are a little steep, and the overall price for the room was steep. However, we will be back, again and again......"
"Review_11341","hotel_118","hotel_5361","Mar 4, 2008","The Tired Casita We stayed two nights in a casita at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort. Other reviewers have mentioned that the property is upgrading the casitas. They definitely had not made it to this one yet. The unit had a bedroom and bathroom upstairs and a good sized common area downstairs. The spaces were okay but everything was really tired. The carpeting was dated and worn as was the furniture. It may take several visits to the chiropractor to recover from the fold out couch experience.The resort itself is actually pretty nice for a family with kids. The water park, mini-golf and sports courts are nothing fancy but just fine for young kids. We ate one meal at the Hole-in-the-Wall restaurant and it was better than average.The whole resort is a very large facility and if you're in one of the casitas, be prepared for a long walk to get back to the main areas. Also, many of the casitas border a residential street so you don't have the feel that your in a vacation location.All in all, you get about what your pay for which is a decent resort at a decent price."
"Review_11342","hotel_118","hotel_7385","Feb 27, 2008","An ok place to stay. This was the last place we stayed on our trip through Arizona. We payed $206/night and stayed for 2 nights. It's quite a large property and we had a bit of a hike before we found the registration desk. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. Our room was on the third floor of the North building. It was clean and quiet and the beds in this place are AMAZING! Best sleep I had all trip. Our kids loved the waterpark, in fact they never even tried the pool in the buildings courtyard. There is a mini-golf, basketball and tennis courts and several pools on the resort. The mini-golf and tennis courts are available if you pay a fee of $2.95/day, which was reasonable, but we weren't informed untill we checked in.The things we didn't like:We never got a complimentary paper the first morning, and the gift shop was always out. The business centre cost $0.49/min for internet access, something that every other place we stayed at provided for free. The roads around the resort were solid cars at Phoenix rush hour every day. Food was very expensive but hey, it's a resort. We ate off the resort, many restaurants only a short drive away. Also, there was no fridge in our suite (unless there was one in the mini-bar that we didn't open!)Apart from these minor annoyances, we did enjoy the resort. We will probably try another place the next time we are in Phoenix."
"Review_11343","hotel_118","hotel_3100","Feb 27, 2008","Thanks for the wonderful upgrade! When we arrived at the Squaw Peak peak we were greeted by a very friendly staff and during check-in I asked for a free upgrade (rent a ton of Hilton rooms throughout the year) and the desk manager gave us a WONDERFUL Casita (Town home). Ours had a pool and Hot tub attached to it that could be used by the public, but it was very quiet and felt like it was just ours to use. Unit # 3243. Our unit had a kitchen, 2 bathrooms, and a nice dresing area. The bedroom had a king sized COMFY bed and it seemed clean. A little outdated and one of the windows was too high to reach the blind leaving a direct view into our bathroom at night (wouldn't want to be spotted naked). It also had a water fountain outside by the pool and we slept perfectly to the sound of the water. This is a great place for Kids and families, but still quiet enough for just the two of us. We strolled around the property and it has a very cool water park, mini golf, and fun stuff for the kids. You can't bring food or bevs from the outside into the pool area so a few drinks in the sun can get a little pricey. It was to chilly to use the waterpark for a couple of adults, but the kids were having a blast.We did eat at the Hole in the wall rest and the food was very good. I just didn't get the feeling that it was very clean in there.Walgreens is just down the street and they have a liquor store attached so you can find all your needs there.We ate at a fun rest called The Fish Market just a few exits down on 51S and it was VERY good! The chef changed a few things for us and didn't mind. (I like Pasta instead of rice). Although, they had security and so that made me a little uneasy about the area."
"Review_11344","hotel_118","hotel_9674","Feb 26, 2008","Outstanding in all respects Over the past couple of years, aging parent issues have taken me to Phoenix frequently, so I've had the opportunity to try several hotels in the metro area. After my most recent two-night stay, the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort is my new favorite. It鈥檚 an 鈥渁ll-suite鈥?property with lots to recommend it.Our plane landed just before noon and, after a couple of grueling flights, my wife and I wanted to freshen up and eat a decent meal before seeing my folks. When I called the hotel, the front desk clerk was very helpful and confirmed that the suite they'd set aside for us was indeed ready, so we headed straight for the resort.Upon check-in, which was handled very smoothly, we were informed of the resort option package, which provides a number of amenities (including fitness center access, spa discounts, and local phone calls) for $2.25 a day. As Hilton HHonors members, we were also given two complimentary bottles of water.After freshening up, we headed to the Hole in the Wall Restaurant for lunch. This was a bit nostalgic for me, as I grew up in Phoenix and friends and I had frequented the Hole in the Wall at its original location in its early days. The food was (and still is) basic burgers, sandwiches, and quesadillas, but well prepared and reasonably-priced (especially considering it鈥檚 in a resort). The service was also excellent.Thus fortified, we set off to see The Parents.Over the next several days, our two-room suite became our sanctuary. It included a separate living room and bed room, robes (without having to ask), a very comfy bed, the fluffiest towels I have used in a long time (at home or away), a balcony, a well-stocked mini-bar, and some of the best in-room coffee I've in a long time. While our room was in one of two multi-story buildings, the resort also offers casitas - single story structures away from the larger buildings and adjacent conference center.While the property has four restaurants, we only ate at the Hole in the Wall. However, we did use room service, which was also prompt, polite, and provided well-prepared fare.There are several pools available, including a small water park adjacent to the Hole in the Wall. And even though a fair number of kids were present at the hotel, it was overall very quiet.Plenty of free parking and easy access to the rest of Phoenix make this a winner in my book. Without a doubt, we will be back."

We never get bored with all the pools, lazy river, etc. Plus, it's reasonably priced. That's because it's probably due to be updated. It's a Hilton, and it's not bad at all. The rooms are nice. I think they're all suites, which is great for a family. They are very clean and decorated nicely, albeit a bit outdated. There are a few maintenance issues going on, but we easily overlooked that, and our kids couldn't care less. They had a blast!"

We were placed into a 4th floor room that had ants running above the window and in the closet. After calling the front desk, they sent someone who sprayed. Ants were gone. Bathroom sink didn't have hot water, but the shower did. TV had a high pitched whine, that didn't go away after muting it. Both issues were reported to maintenance and repaired on the second day.Beds are very comfortable. Pretty quiet property. Limited menu selections in both restaurants. Hole in the Wall is kid friendly western style. Lanina Grill is a little too upscale for breakfast, but delicious and friendly during dinner."
"Review_11347","hotel_118","hotel_4144","Jan 31, 2008","Nice hotel, but a labyrinth I was here for a conference (paid $199 per night). The hotel itself is beautiful---lots of attention to detail with fountains, plants, architecture. I believe that every room is a suite---a living room with a pull out couch, TV, and mini bar, a middle area with the bathroom, and a bedroom and lanai. Room was quite clean, bed comfy, and new looking linens. I think I must have had one of the newly remodeled rooms---very nice. They seems to have an abundance of conference rooms and meeting areas that are quite nice. Cons*The bathroom towels were tired looking and scratchy.*The swimming pool is in a center courtyard and is small and shallow. Great for dipping, but not doing laps, and if kids were around it would be quite noisy. It looks like only one side gets sun at a time, which could be a problem if the hotel is busy. (I didn鈥檛 visit the hotel鈥檚 waterpark.) *They had a lot of rain the days before I arrived. I heard some fellow guests complain about leaks in their rooms. My only experience (on the 4th floor) were some small ants in the bathroom.*My biggest complaint is that the hotel is laid out like a labyrinth, with lots of little, dark walkways. I kept getting confused as to where I was and how to get to my room, the main lobby, and the rooms where my meetings were. Each turn looks like it鈥檚 鈥渨rong鈥?because it looks like a service ally, not like a main path, and the elevators are strangely located and even hidden in some cases. Although at night the property had nice mood lighting, given the small dark passageways during the daytime, at night it was creepier. Granted I was on my own---but if I were here with my husband I can see that it would have been romantic."
"Review_11348","hotel_118","hotel_3056","Jan 31, 2008","Need to complete the refurb quick! Stayed here for a few days in January and paid an additional fee to stay in a Casita. The fee was verbally given as $75 for the whole stay but on check out we the charge was $375! The Casita itself was well past its sell-by date. It rained one night and water came in through the balcony door, and generally the decor was in a poor shape. To give Hilton some credit they are going through a refurb programme so I guess the one I had was on the list.January is probably not the best month to be there as a lot of the facilities were shut but the overall impressing was that it would suit a low budget family holiday."
"Review_11349","hotel_118","hotel_4425","Jan 29, 2008","More than I expected Just came back from 5 days with my wife, son (16) and daughter (12). We were very impressed with the resort with it being rated as a 3 star resort. I am sure in its earlier days (before the Phoenician's and Boulders came to be) this was the place to go. We were somewhat hesitant to book a 3 star resort but came away very pleased and would stay here again.We paid $161/night with AAA and found that to be a good price for the room/resort. We had a two, queen bed casita with a pullout out couch in the common area. We spent sometime in the on-site waterpark (the waterslide was not open and we should have been told about this upfront) and had a nice time there with the kids. Coming from Mass. the weather was great (mid 60's) and certainly pool weather for us!Ate two meals (one dinner and one breakfast) at the Off the Wall restaurant on the property and found the food was ok and very pricey. Would suggest you eat off the property. By the way...there was rattesnake listed as an appetizer on the menu at Hole in the Wall. The waiter brought out a frozen rattlesnake from the kitchen. The kids loved that!There was renovation going on at the fitness center and they had temporary quarters (no charge to use) and had plenty of equipment. The new facility looks fabulous (I wish it was done for us..oh well). Other than that we saw very little renovating happening. My sense is that our casita had been renovated sometime in the past year. It smell very fresh and was very clean.The staff was great and friendly, particluarly the concierge.Tip of the trip: Make a dinner resrvation at Sam's Cafe. One of the best meals we have ever had."
"Review_11350","hotel_118","hotel_7409","Jan 15, 2008","Terrible serve The resort looks nice from the outside, but once you get inside you can tell that they are undergoing a major renovation. We booked a 2 bed room casita over the phone for 3 days to accomodate 4 adults and 2 young children. When we arrived the guy took us to a casita and told us that we were in luck because this was a remodeled casita. Then he couldn't get the key to work, so he called up to the front desk and they told him that it wasn't quite finished yet. Then he took us to another casita, this one was not remodeled so we were a little dissapointed but not completely unhappy until we realized that it was only one bedroom. I informed the guy that it was not a 2 bedroom that we had booked over the phone and he had the nerve to ask me are you sure you booked a 2 bedroom. There was one queen sized bed and a full size pull out couch for 6 people. He then called the front desk again and they informed him that all 2 bedroom casitas were occupied. The guy then told us we could have 2 regular hotel rooms that were close to one another. I specifically booked a casita because I have a 1 year old who would need a refridgerator to store milk for his bottles. Also the bedrooms are upstairs so when my 2 kids take naps we can sit downstairs and watch tv or talk. So we stayed in the 1 bedroom casita for one night and after 1:00 the next day we loaded up all are things and moved to a 2 bedroom casita. This casita was not remodeled and the carpet was ripped in various locations. Oh and the elcetricity kept going out and we would have to have someone come and fix the fuse. After the all the trouble we went through trying to get our room correct the night before, they guy told us that he would get us vouchers for one of the restaurants. That never happened. Don't eat at the Latina grill the food is overpriced and the service is terrible. We didn't try any of the other restaurants after that. The pool area looked nice but it was a little too cold for us to try them out. This resort could be nice after the renovation is complete and they get some people who know what there doing at the front desk."
"Review_11351","hotel_118","hotel_4287","Jan 9, 2008","Good value for your money My husband and I picked this resort because it was reasonably close to our son's baseball tournament. Last year we stayed at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs and loved it. Thought we would try this one for a change and liked it's proximity to the freeway to get to the ballpark. We particularly liked the spacious private casita. We had a pool and hot tub right outside our door and it was never busy. We managed to squeeze in one afternoon floating down the Lazy River and going down the water slide. Great fun in the very hot sun! Ate one night in the hotel's Lantana Grille and it was okay. Another night we wandered down the street about 2 blocks and stumbled on the best Italian food in a restaurant called Tutti Santi. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but inside is great and we had a really fun evening there. Because the hotel is close to the freeway, it was easy to dine in other areas and we had a fabulous dinner at Roy's in Scottsdale. At this hotel we liked the spacious rooms which included a kitchen and we like the proximity to the freewy. At Tapatio Cliffs we liked the scenery, the layout of the resort in the cliffs, and the more adult-oriented facilities including the great bar by the big pool. The rooms at Tapatio Cliffs were smaller than casitas but they were very nice and we liked being able to keep our sliding door open all night. Although we really liked Squaw Peak, I think next time we will return to Tapatio Cliffs."

We were in the South Pointe on the 3rd floor, which was the top floor on the side we were at, so why it's called a Tower I don't know.Lovely aspect overlooking Squaw Peak Mountain on one side and gardens on the other.Very quiet.Just a short stroll to The Hole in Wall for a great breakfast , then a stroll around the waterpark and maybe a go on the putting green, with an impossible Hole 17!!! for no extra charge...Perfect way to start the day!The whole place was immaculate .The Casitas were being renovated and when we return I think we will stay in one as they looked fabulous with very large outdoor patios and balconies although the suite we had was more than big enough for 2 of us a balcony big enough for sunbeds would have been a treat, but ours did have a table and 2 chairs.Also ,not mentioned on the hotel website, there are 3 laundry areas with washer and tumble dryers, very useful when staying for 3 weeksAll staff were very efficient and more so...David, Carol and Joan on the Concierge Desk were absolute treasures and whatever Hilton pay them it's not enough.Nothing was too much trouble ,directions, maps , things to do , shopping tips bookings for restaurants.They always greeted me by name and even allowed me to use their computer, with no charge ,after I had struggled with the one in the Business Centre.The Online Check-in point in the reception area is worth it's weight as it allowed me to check-in , choose great seats as they are very few 2 seats only, on 747's,and then print Boarding Passes all for free for our return flight ( which I did do for the my flight to Phoenix with BA before I left home)I have to say some of the reviews I had read did worry me but as I had booked before I read them I had to go and I'm so glad I did.Have travelled round the world and stayed in some great places , even The Four Seasons in Las Vegas, but this hotel did not dissappoint."

I came to it solo for a business conference but would definitely come back to it if I return to Phoenix with the family.  Most of the hotel rooms are clustered in the front of the sprawling property at its North Pointe and South Pointe. The rooms in each pointe surround a courtyard with a small swimming pool. The conference rooms are between the two pointes but the hotel desk in the South Pointe.  I was in a nice suite in the North Pointe that would comfortably handle a family of four. There was a living room with a pull-out couch, desk and widescreen for TV/Internet, a bathroom and walkway in the middle, and a bedroom next to a balcony on the other side.  In the back of the property are a four-acre mini-waterpark to the north which is exceptional, a kid's daycamp  Casitas suites in the middle, and a spa which includes a lap pool to the south. The casitas seem to be two story town house-type suites.  The restaurant which is off the front parking lot was not real fancy but good food for a hotel and fine for a family. Note that the waterpark has its own restauant, ice cream shop, etc.  The property has lighted tennis courts but if you want to golf, you have to go four miles away to the sister Hilton property. That other Hilton property also has a fine upscale restaurant (A Different Point of View) which is highly recommended for adults but not really for kids).  The staff was nice and my stay very pleasant. I'll probably be back with the family in the future."

We've both seen the inside of plenty of BBs throughout Ireland and the UK to have certain expectations. Before we arrived, The Edward II seemed like a godsend 鈥?SF was our first stop after a very long flight, we needed a place for our first night, and most of the city was booked out. What our stay actually became boiled down to the following:The Room: Advertised as a Classic queen but really a drag. Cramped and clammy with shabby furniture sporting stains, burn marks, gnawed corners. Sink next to the bed and not in the bathroom. Wires *everywhere*.The Ick Factor: Found a old hand-towel stuffed in the windowsill to collect moisture. hair on the shower walls... and on the floor. The Bathroom: Toilet did not flush. DID. NOT. FLUSH. The Noise: Construction in the lot next door started at 6am, housekeeping started at 8am. The shared bathroom for the floor was on the other side of our headboard; it also served as phone booth for guests looking to multi-task at 2am.But, most importantly...The Staff: At check-out I rationally and civilly complained to the woman at the front desk. She didn't handle the complaint but promised to let the manager 鈥?who wasn't in that day 鈥?know when he returned and he would contact us to resolve the issue.(Later, after seeing a photo of the owner/operators on their site, we realised the manager hadn't been away, but in the next room the entire time.)After returning to Ireland we called the hotel to repeat the complaint and got the same woman who checked us out. After being told it was our own fault we didn't complain sooner and more vociferously, I let her know about EU laws allowing charge-backs on credit cards for failure to deliver service as advertised... and only then was I given 20% back from the cost of the stay."
"Review_11357","hotel_119","hotel_9853","Oct 4, 2008","A Charming Hotel - don't believe the nasty reviews I had already booked my stay at the Edward II when the previous flop house review came out, and I apologized in advance to the coworker whom I'd also booked there. It turns out there was NOTHING to worry about. My coworker had grown up in England and said the inn felt like home to her. Here is my take on the experience. First the cons:The rooms are small, for me this was cozy and nice since I was staying alone. It would've been tougher to share the room with anyone but a spouse/close family member. It is also on a noisy street (even the sides that don't face Lombard are noisy), but I borrowed a fan from the management and had no problems with that. There are a few small items in need of repair (a loose tile in the bathroom, etc.). There is some fuss made about the smell in other reviews. Honestly, to me it didn't smell bad - it just smells like an older building, like my grandmother's house which had radiators just like the Edward II. Really, not a problem except for those who would wear Lysol as cologne.The pros: It is charming. The breakfast room has plenty to eat - oatmeal, fresh fruit, juice, breads, several cereals, pasty, quiche, GOOD coffee and a very extensive selection of loose teas with little teapots for steeping. It was clean and the beds and pillows were comfortable. The innkeepers were very helpful - answered every question and accommodated every request. The neighborhood has plenty going on and is safe for walking. I went out for a late walk and strolled to a 24 Hour Fitness that was about a mile and a half away at around 9 at night and came back an hour and a half later with no concerns about safety. There are a lot of great restaurants, shops and nightlife on Chestnut street a block away. Bottom line, this place was perfectly nice. I would stay there again."

The owner was so kind and helpful and this high level of customer service continued throughout our stay; the staff were always available to offer advice and local knowledge. The location is fantastic and even though the hotel is decorated in a very quaint 'Olde English' style our room was more than big enough and sharing a bathroom was not a problem at all. All in all we were really happy with our choice."

However I don't think all the rooms get used to often so you have almost exclusive use of the bathroom. I never crossed paths with anyone.2. Rooms  Beds are comfortable. For the price you pay your getting fantastic value. If you want fairmont... go to fairmont. Seriously why would you rate a $100 hotel at the standard of a $200+ hotel. 3. Check-in isn't 24-hour but the front door is locked by a security code. We were late but with a phone call we were given the code and our room which had the key waiting for us. Well organised.4. Reviews make you fear these kind of hotels but it is a perfectly safe and sound establishment. There is a bar of some kind but I don't think it was open to the public. In a nice safe part of town.Would return."

The sitting room is located just across the sidewalk from busy Lombard street, so the traffic noise was loud. The bedroom was quiet enough if we closed the door. The room had many nice features including a refrigerator, microwave, electric fireplace, soft robes, and a TV with a DVD player. Blockbuster is just across the street.Don't plan on sharing the Jacuzzi. It's not large enough for two people. It does not have a shower curtain, so water splashes on the floor during showers. It's not a huge effort to dry the floor with a towel, but I'd prefer a shower curtain. The breakfast quiche had too many onions for my taste. Other items included fruit juice, cold cereal, toast, instant oatmeal, grocery store pastries, plus apples, bananas and grapes. The breakfast reminds me of the expanded continental breakfast served at many motel chains. We liked the proximity to the Marina and Presidio, and plan to return. We also enjoyed the seafood at Cafe Maritime next door. Hime, the Japanese restaurant on the next block was good, too."

This was our description of the room (same for each):Room : Standard queen room with private bathNonsmoking/Smoking: Non-SmokingRoom type: 1 QUEEN BED$127/nightMy sister checked in first, and received an extremely small room that made her feel claustrophobic for the first time in a hotel. The bathroom was not large enough to have two people in there at once. There was no heater in the rom. When she went downstairs to try to upgrade, they said they didn't have any other rooms, and she asked if they had any roms with refrigerators, and they said they didn't . Then a few hours later, I checked in and received a beautiful room with a refrigerator and a rotating heater on top of the frig. We had a little sink in the room next to our bed. The bathroom was a good size with a square tub/shower (but the sink was in the bedroom next to the bed). Overall the size was quaint, but we were very happy with it. When my sister came down to see our room she couldn't believe the difference, when we paid the SAME PRICE! She was not too pleased. I would have been really upset if I were her too! We had Rm. 218 if you'd like to know. We were very happy with it. I was especialy happy because I needed the frig. You could even specify you NEED a frig to get a better room? My sister's room was Rm. 306--AVOID this room.The breakfast was good. They put out a hot quiche pie, cereals, toasts, danishes, coffe, hot chocolate, juice, milk, etc... If you stay here you have to try a cupcake at Kara's Cupcakes right on Scott St. a half a block away.. They are the most incredible cupcakes you will ever try! My favorites were Sweet Vanilla, the chocolate one, and Banana caramel.Good location. Have fun if you go, and have a cupcake for me!"

It was our first time to Arizona and really enjoyed it. Our room was immaculate and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. We ate breakfast in the condo every morning and had lunch at the Resort twice. The food was excellent in the restaurant. We drove to the Grand Canyon and Sedona for a couple of days. Amazing scenery!! We did lots of shopping and really enjoyed shopping at the Anthem Mills Outlet about a 30 minute drive North of the Legacy. We did the walk at 9:00 a.m. two of the mornings we were there with Jeannie! It was a little over an hr. and we were able to chat and get some exercise in while seeing more of the area. We used the pool area. They provided lots of towels and lounges and umbrellas for shade.They don't allow you to bring food into the pool area and we felt sorry for the families with young children because they were told they couldn't give their children their snacks. They could only eat the food sold in the pool area. There are lots of good restaurants within driving distance from the Legacy and also Scottsdale was fun to visit and not a far drive. I think we will definitely return to the Legacy but would make sure we didn't get room 10113 again. It was backing on to the cleaning supply room and we were disturbed numerous times in our sleep by staff going in and out of this room. When they were talking on their walkie talkies it was like they were in the room with us!! We could have complained but we were too lazy to change our room by the time we realized this was a problem.Also, I just want to add the staff were all very friendly and service was very good."

The service is very good and the food and selection good as well. One morninh at breakfast when a large party came in ahead of us it took a bit longer to get our order and the manager came over and gave us our meal at no charge because of the wait and since we were checking out that morning also called the front desk to let them know we were going to be a little late.Our overall experience was excellent and we already have another stay booked next month."

"Review_11368","hotel_120","hotel_2985","Sep 2, 2008","Keep In Mind: Legacy is an exchange resort, not a hotel Be aware, Legacy is a vacation exchange resort, not a hotel. Upon arrival, there was no baggage assistance, our luggage was stored in an unlocked conference room since they stuck VERY closely to their 4PM check-in time. The desk staff was not that competent in handling our check-in and room assignment. There is only one restaurant with limited operating hours, and when our large party (10) arrived one evening for dinner about an hour before closing, we were absolutely assured (without us asking!) by the bartender that there was no way he would serve after the 9pm closing time! 9pm, on a Friday night, for a party of 10 (and others already dining)! Not to mention it took a long time to receive our cocktails and 4 of the 8 ordered were incorrect...The pool bar (serving food as well) closed several hours before the sun went down and the crowd diminished. No pool toys or rafts are allowed in the pool, and the Pool Nazi made sure you did not bring ANY beverages to the pool area, and hounded you with a copy of the written rules until you left or he took your beverages. The pools was very well maintained, plenty of lounge chairs and towels.The rooms (1-bedroom and 2-bedroom suites) were very well appointed, very clean and well-maintained. They had very good appliances, including a large refrigerator/freezer. The golf course was in very good condition, a good challenge, with free club rental and a very low rate for guests.As long as you are aware of the above, I would recommend Legacy for someone desiring a low-key, quiet get-away to the desert of Arizona. It is a long drive to Scottsdale and many of the other attractions of Phoenix."

I found the Legacy Golf Resort on the internet and it seemed to have everything I required. (Sun, golf, pool, easy access to and from the airport, reasonably priced). I guess everything in Arizona would be less expensive in summer due to the heat factor, but even if the cost of the weeks stay was 2 or 3 times more it would be worth it. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. The room exceded my expectations. Very clean and well equiped with whatever one needs. The pool area was no exception, it too was cleaned daily and the area was well equiped and comfortable. The golf course was inexpensive and was a very nice course to play. The course staff were excellent representatives of a first a rate resort. Courteous and helpful in all aspects. I did not use the restaurant, therefore I am unable to comment in that regard, however, in keeping with everything else there, it was probably very good. They also have a very nicely equiped, maintained and air conditioned workout facility for an afternoon workout when the sun heats up to 110. This is a family oriented resort which is something new to me as I generally look for a more adult oriented vacation, however I wouldn't hesitate recommending this resort to anyone. As I am more for accustomed to adult only vacations I may look for something more along those lines in the future, but still give the Legacy Resort full marks overall."

This unfortunately happened at 10:30 pm and 3:30am. The staff did respond quickly to our complaint at 3:30am and the noise ceased. We could not fault the facilities or staff.

The 'Hotel' side of the lock-off, which I assume can be booked on its on based on the set-up, had a patio, king bed, full bathroom, and a small refrigerator and microwave. The room would be perfect for a solo traveler or a couple. Although it had a sitting area that pulled out into a 2nd bed it wouldn't allow any privacy since it was one open room. The '1bedroom' side of the accomodations had a private bedroom area with master bath including a jacuzzi tub. The condo was quite large, had a full kitchen, a pull out sofa bed in the living room, and a patio. The resort is two levels and does not offer elevators. No daily housekeeping or towel changes.The resort grounds were beautifully kept and they offered an 18-hole golf course, shuffle board, and a gorgeous pool with pool bar. The onsite restaurant and bar were fantastic and were adjacent to the pro shop. The resort is fairly close to the airport, but most other adventures require a drive.

But that is a whole different kind of place.The staff was prompt, they were friendly, and very Polite on the phone. They even call back to make sure the problems, or requests have been taken care of. I was really impressed. Rooms were large enough, table seats 6 (in my room 1 bd)Laundry is handy, but loud. Should have been near entrance way instead. Had to turn up TV to hear at all.I am used to rudeness, no response at all, and horse play from the staff. Instead they were professionals.Amenities are nice.Things that this resort desperately needs.MORE SHADE around the pool. They have umbrellas attached to tables....but not enough trees, or umbrellas to shade the lounge chairs. In the day of skin cancer awareness this is a problem.Wireless for the rooms.Swings for kids playground. (more shade)The only real mishap we had was not being able to check into our room for 2 hours past check in time. Housecleaning had not gotten to it yet....and repairs were being done.We went to Botanical Gardens, Zoo, and Arizona Mills Mall, and Lake Pleasant. I recommend all these for your trip there.Lake Pleasant is at least 30 mins away. But the rest are about 5-7 miles away.To Eat: PLEASE go to the FARM which is located practically next door. They have 3 types of restaurants.....one for breakfast, one for lunch (picnic style) and fance dinner restaurant. You will feel like you are on a retreat. They have plenty of WIDE open space with grass, and in the distance they have the chickens, and veggies growing. The food is made and grown there....so fresh is for sure.Also...please check out the Secret Garden Restaurant VINTAGE MARKET...similar retreat type feel. Koi pond, and old 1929 spanish colonial home....with huge grassy park like area connected to restaurant. (meant for weddings).Ok....married 7 years....but if I were to get married again these are the 2 places that would be excellent choices for receptions."

When booking the hotel, I mistakenly picked the Airport location instead of the Downtown Holiday Inn Express, which was the one I wanted. I think part of the problem was that during booking, the prices of the rooms kept changing, so somehow I accidentally changed hotels. When I showed up at the wrong hotel and figured out my mistake, I tried to transfer the booking. The hotel told me I had to go through Orbitz. Orbitz told me I had to go through the hotel. No one would take responsibility, and no one would help me. I am convinced I would have had better luck if I booked directly with the hotel.Don't stay at this hotel and don't use Orbitz!"

A person was at our door almost immediately to fix the problem. Although the hotel does not have a restaurant we were directed to the Hilton Garden Inn next door which does. We had a nice lunch. We were told that the same owner owns both hotels. They had Fat Tire Amber Ale on draught. Boy, that really hit the spot. The Garden Inn looks like a winner also. Back to the Holiday Inn Express. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom large. Shower had one of those great shower heads that you can now find at most Holiday Inn Expresses. Towels were very large and plush. If you are returning a rental car make sure you get the directions from the front desk, or you may find yourself driving in circles. The breakfast was good as was the outdoor pool and hot tub.

The complimentary breakfast is very nice and has a wide selection of breads, pastries and cereals, as well as eggs and bacon. Check-in was fast and efficient and the staff were helpful and friendly. There is a PC in the foyer which guests can use to access the internet. If you're looking for a hotel near the airport before or after a flight then I highly recommend the Holiday Inn."

The staff at the front desk was very accomodating getting us our room earlier than check in time. Also, front desk was helpful to us with info about bringing our car back to airport, (which by the way was the worst part of our vacation.) The evening gathering in the lobby had 2 free drinks per guest which was a nice touch.I also took advantage of the laundry area to do vacation laundry. The rooms were large and very clean. The free shuttle to the airport the next morning was right on time and accomodating. I think the staff at this hotel gets a high 5 for service."

The staff were friendly and helpful and when we checked in the poor check in girl had phones ringing and a long queue to deal with but she kept calm and friendly throughout. The room had two beds and was clean with a great air conditioning given the outside heat. Breakfast was a buffet and it was included in the price. There was internet access, with a printer, freely available in the foyer area."

It was supposed just to be a decent hotel near the airport before taking the 7 am flight. Turned out to be very accomodating, with friendly stuff, good and inexpensive restaurant at the Hilton next door, with spacious rooms with kettle, coffee and tea. Unfortunately we did not stay long enough to try the breakfast or use the pool. Free wi-fi and free use of a computer with internet in the lobby.The shuttle service to the airport was very helpful (the first one left at 4am).Overall, we would definitely recommend this hotel for a convenient stay nearby Phoenix airport."

We got to the hotel about 2 hours early and decided to see if we could check in early. The staff said it was no problem and checked us quickly in. Hotel was clean and room was nice and cool on a 100 degree day. The hotel seemed to be in a nice safe location. Looked like a business area but there was a Waffle House right next door. Very quick access to the interstate as well. Very nice hotel, would stay at again if going to Phoenix."
"Review_11399","hotel_121","hotel_3810","May 13, 2008","OK rooms, below average service Being in the hospitality business, you see a lot. There are some things that are not within a hotel's control, such as a city's temporary shut-off of water, etc. Service, however is paramount, and as a supervisor of mine always puts it, A room is a room, is a room. Guests want great service. At check in for a weekend we weren't really greeted but checked into our room. We made it to the happy hour and requested a gin and tonic, but they were out of tonic water. A vodka and orange juice? No orange juice. My friend joked,OK what can we have? The response was,Well you're a little late for cocktail hour, so you're lucky you're getting anything. I looked at his face for some sign of jest, but he was serious.The next night after requesting a ride on their complementary shuttle for a night out on the town, we were turned down because it was considered outside of their service zone. The clerk at the desk scoffed while letting us know, but called a cab for us. Rooms here are comfortable, and reflect an updated Holiday Inn look. Beds are very comfy. Being so close to the airport, this establishment is probably very used to accomodating business travelers and older patrons. Maybe the service we received was due to our age (late 20s). Nonetheless, I was not impressed, but I am glad that others have had positive experiences here. I won't be going back."

During the week we stayed at two other higher priced hotels in Scottsdale and in Sedona but we found the value and attention to detail at the Phoenix Holiday Inn Express. Every staff member that we met were wonderful--from the front desk to the person picking us up and dropping us off at the airport. The breakfast was more than adequate and an especially nice touch was a happy hour at the end of the day. The rooms were very large with comfortable beds--very clean! We were travelling with our teenage son and found the space to be larger than most. Each room is equipped with a refrigerator. In this day and age when airline travel can be frustrating, these folks made our stay near the airport stress free. They actually shuttled us to the airport the night before to return our rental car and then again the next day. Everyone was very accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel for value, comfort, location and service."

"Review_11405","hotel_121","hotel_4658","Feb 29, 2008","Okay but nothing special We stayed 5 nights at this property and have to say that it is an average, what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express. The breakfast was decent but you won't find much fresh fruit other than an apple. At EXACTLY 9:30 a.m. the staff immediately closed down the breakfast bar and anyone coming a minute late was pretty much out of luck. Most places are a little more casual, expecially on the weekends but not here. The free hosted bar is open from 6-7:30 pm M-F but we weren't able to make it to any of the nights as we were out eating dinner. It would seem like a slightly earlier opening time might be more customer friendly.The front desk staff was generally helpful and there is internet access from their computer in the lobby.The pool and spa area are small. Fortunately, both were kept very warm which was nice as the weather was somewhat cool. We had to ask for towels every day we used the spa/pool which could easily be solved by having an area at the pool stocked with towels. If your looking for a decent pool scene, this is not the place as it is way too small an area.Maid service was good and the room was kept clean and well supplied. Having a microwave and fridge really helped.This hotel is not near any restaurants/supermarkets and a car is a must in this area. It is convienient however to get on the freeway and go where ever you need to go.I would probably consider staying here again but would not pay $180 a night under any circumstances."

It's 2 exits down the hwy from the Sky Harbor off-site rental car pick-up  return center. What can I say about Holiday Inn as all of we baby boomers grew up with this chain. The hotel is located in a VERY CLEAN office/warehouse area just off I-10 near PHX Sky Harbor airport. The rooms are clean and bed and sheets were crisp and comfortable. There is computer in the lobby with internet access so you can print your boarding pass for an early flight the next day if you wish. They have the Holiday Inn fresh start breakfest in the morning but I did not indulge as I chose to walk across the parking lot to the WAFFLE HOUSE for the best breakfest anyware. This is NOT a place for children and used mainly by business folks. Nothing fancy here but a good clean room that's convenient to the airport. I highly recommend this hotel.

I booked the Sofitel for a one-night stay on a mid-week business trip to Los Angeles. The hotel is nicely situated directly across from the Beverly Center, one of LA's best shopping malls. Good food and sightseeing options are right outside the door, which is rare for LA.The hotel is modern and hip with very well kept grounds and an impressive entry area. The rooms are also modern in appearance with flat panel TVs and sharp, clean decor.I found the service to be superior, from the reception to the valet parking attendants. No issues at check-in. check-out or anywhere in between.Consistent with earlier reviews, the room I was given was very small for the States. If I was with my wife, we would have been cramped. But, for one, the size was fine. I also found the room to be otherwise spotless and comfortable, with a good view of the busy LA street scene below. The bed was comfortable and I slept well.So, in all, I would recommend the Sofitel for travelers to LA or those on business. It is well located and can be a good value, especially if you shop around on discount internet websites."
"Review_11409","hotel_122","hotel_7607","Dec 26, 2008","Acceptable The Sofitel is probably hit or miss, and for me, it was a miss.The hotel looks nice and it is furnished in a way you would expect from a 4-star place. The service was very friendly, and we had a decent time overall. However, we had a few problems--each minor, but collectively annoying--during our stay:1) We arrived to find stains on our sheets and no soap in the bathroom. And because we had arrived late, we had to change the sheets ourselves.2) The walls between us and our neighbors were surprisingly thin. At one point we could hear the local newscast on the TV next door as if it were showing in our room.3) This was the kicker--it happened to rain on our last night there, and all the water off the roof drained right onto a metal windowsill outside our window. Needless to say, we slept very poorly, even after housekeeping gave us some earplugs. If it rains, DO NOT STAY ON THE 4TH FLOOR.Interestingly, when I complained to the front desk, she said many of the guests had made similar complaints, and that the hotel management was pushing for a renovation. I won't be staying again until they do."

They were running a special (2 nights for the price of 3) which put a hotel like this in my price range (approx $250 a night). I was impressed that the gentlemen that met me at the front door actually walked me to the reception area, got me checked in, got me acclimated to the hotel  it's ameneties and escorted me to the elevator. I also appreciated his asking if I needed assistance to the room (which I didn't). I didn't really deal much w/ the rest of the staff, with the exception of valet, and they were always prompt  courteous in retrieving my car. The daily fee is a bit steep ($30), but we were in Beverly Hills. The room was very comfortable and stylish. My room faced the Beverly Center on Beverly Blvd, so there was a a little traffic noise, but being from a city, I didn't find it too distracting. Very comfortable bed and a really nice, large bathroom. The shower is one of those rain showers - I am not a fan, but that is just personal taste. The towels were fantastic, fluffy and plentiful. The location is great if you are a shopper. Right across from the Beverly Center and close to Robertson Blvd, 3rd street and the Grove. This will be one of the first places I look at when booking my next trip to LA and if the price is right, I will definitely stay here again."

I have to say i wasn't disappointed! the location was great!! as we were not driving we wanted a good base and we couldn't have asked for more. We walked to Rodeo Drive and even Hollywood (although this is a bit of a walk). We could also walk down past the Beverly Centre to the next main avenue and get buses to all location, we managed to go to Santa Monica and downtown by bus for example. When we first arrived we were given a room facing the Beverly Centre however after reading the reviews here we quickly asked for a view of the Hills and were given one immediately which was fantastic, could even see the Hollywood sign.Would definitely recommend this hotel, great base.

The gym was one of the nicest hotel gyms that I have seen as it had brand new equipment, free evian water and nice eucalyptus towels. The pool was very small and was salt water but it was nice enough. Not much of a pool scene but the other benefits of the hotel outweighed this small problem.

We checked in at 3pm and found the room very comfortable. We stayed in the room until 7pm when we went out for a party. When we got back there was a HUGE private party in the hotel bar/restaurant. It took us awhile to drive up to the hotel door as paparazzi and limo's were blocking our way for a bit. When we finally got to our room on the 8th floor, it was like we were AT the party. The noise was unbelievable and was going to be that loud until 1:30 we were told. The hotel staff were fairly helpful and changed our room, however the first room they switched us to had the same problem, since we were still facing the street. I think the noise was bouncing off the Shopping Center's walls across the street... Finally, they switched us again to a room facing the hills, and we couldn't hear a thing and had a peaceful night. I would say the staff did alright - they were friendly and accommodating, but should have guessed we needed a room on the opposite side of the street the first time round. I would recommend asking for a room on the 'hill' side if you are staying at the hotel on a weekend."

We stayed in a suite and were on the penthouse floor. The only complaint was the sound of sirens that occasionally went by enroute to Cedars Sinai hospital which was a block away from the hotel. The staff were all very courteous with the exception of one concierge who seemed to be a gal with a poor attitude and work ethic. The other concierge staff were amazing getting us a reservation at Madeo restaurant with only a couple hours notice. The dining at the hotel was pretty decent food and the breakfast fare was quite reasonably priced as well. The room was very clean and always replenished with complimentary Evian bottles of water. The pool was a great little spot with TV's in some of the cabanas and music playing. Room service would also come and bring you drinks and food if requested at the pool. The location of the hotel was fabulous. It is directly across the street from a pretty standard mall. It was within walking distance to some really fine dining - Madeo, The Jar, The Ivy. It is very close to walk to the Farmer's Market, CBS Studios and The Grove outdoor shopping center (great spot). It is a short 3 block walk to Robertson Boulevard which has some fabulous shopping. Melrose Avenue is a hike but we walked to it (disappointing as it is really rundown and the type of shopping where you have to really be in the mood to find what you are looking for).We didn't really frequent the Stone Rose Lounge except for a pre-dinner drink but it seemed to have a really great vibe.My friend and I have decided that we will definitely be back to L.A. for our girl's weekend and enjoyed it better than our last Vegas trip at the Bellagio.

The valet parking is a little steep at $30/day, which they don't seem to disclose anywhere on their site. There's plenty of street parking available. Most of the rooms are average size, but request the larger rooms at the end of the hallway on each floor. The hotel offers very few rooms with double bedding, so don't expect to change bedding unless you've pre-reserved the room. Each room is equipped with a flat screen, fluffy down blanket and the basic necessities. A complimentary mini bottle of Evian is replenshished daily. Internet access is available through T-Mobile hotspots for a daily fee of $10.All hotel staff is very courteous and attentive especially concierge and bellman. We showed up for our dinner reservation that the concierge helped us with and apparently they booked it for the wrong day. So just make sure you re-confirm everything with concierge. Make sure you check your folio upon check out. I pre-paid for the room, but was billed the full room charges again upon check out.Located in a great area, with lots of good eats around.

Stunning modern lobby (although the several doormen 'welcoming' you back to the hotel each time you enter is a little annoying!). There are 3 computers to the side of the reception desk offering free internet access. I didnt dine at the restaurant as looked a little expensive but it looked extremely nice and the adjoining bar loks very funky! I recommend a restaurant called the Grand Lux Cafe just down the road from the hotel - delicious burgers!The room was stunning with really comfortable beds and large bathroom. The only down side was the size of the pool and surrounding area - very small although the space is put to great use with lots of plants and a few lovely secluded seating booths with tvs in. You are not aware of the busy road below.

"Review_11431","hotel_122","hotel_8643","Sep 29, 2008","Central location and great service My family and I booked two rooms at the Sofitel this September and reading a few of the somewhat negative reviews below, I wonder if we are talking about the same hotel. First of all, the hotel staff was gracious enough to give us adjacent rooms and not just rooms on the same floor. The rooms were very spacious, spotless clean, and equipped with all the amenities you could ask for. The bathroom was equally spacious and the supplies replenished without the need to ask. The service from the reception desk and the concierge are exceptional. To give you a few examples: My husband had paid for a laptop at one of the stores but did not have the time to go pick it up; they did it for us and had it delivered to our room. I had seen a video camera that I liked at the same shop but did not remember the exact model. The concierge took the time to search the website of the store I was talking about, scanned all the models until I recognized the one I had liked, and sent out and got it for me. It was again delivered to the room on the same day. This came at a price, but with the short period of time we had at LA, every second counted. At one point, when we came down late one morning, and my elderly mother discovered that the coffee stand at the lobby was shut down, the front desk manager took the time to prepare her a cup in person and bring it over to her while we were waiting for a tour pick up.Everytime we entered the hotel, the staff greeted us with a smile, asking if we were having a good time and if there was anything they could do to make our stay more enjoyable. Also, we had stayed at the Renaissance for a couple of days before that, and while the location was exceptional and the view of the hills and the Hollywood sign an unexpected bonus, the staff there was snobbish and extremely unfriendly. The staff courteous, friendly and efficient attitude at the Sofitel was like a breeze of fresh air.The location was also superb with lots of restaurants, shopping areas, and sights within walking distance. I had such agood time there, that I was really sorry we had only booked a couple of nights and had to leave to San Diego. On a next visit to LA, this is where I will stay and this is the hotel I will be recommending to friends. It is a shame that the Renaissance staff is such a turn off - the hotel's location next to the Hollywood Highland and the view of the hills would have been a great sell."

"Review_11433","hotel_122","hotel_9658","Sep 14, 2008","Better than expected After seeing some of the reviews, I immediately requested a room facing the Hollywood Hills. The room was beautiful (6th floor), and you could see the Hollywood sign. We had a superior room, which I didn't feel was very small- then again, we're from NYC and used to apartments. It was very comfortable and quiet, with a great bathroom. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. We actually didn't valet, and found street parking, which was a little stressful, but saved us $100. Be very careful of the street signs. We were moving the car at 8AM each morning, which was fine, still being on East Coast time. The pool area was nice, but smaller than the pictures. Overall, a very nice stay."
"Review_11434","hotel_122","hotel_1534","Sep 2, 2008","Noisy hotel, lack of service My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. The room we booked was a King Superior with some hills view. The room we were gives was a King room on the 8th floor but directly on Beverly Boulevard, with a view of the shopping center. We got into the elevators and noticed they were not very clean, this continued throughout our stay, as did trash that was not picked up the entire stay. Hallway carpets were dirty and stained. The room was small but clean, but very noisy. We could hear the traffic on Beverly and the people in the room next to us, especially when you were in the bathroom. We had to keep the bathroom door closed at night to keep the noise out. The bed was the worst I have ever slept in. It was lumpy and uneven from the mattress cover, there was no headboard only a 4 gap between the bed and the wall where they had placed electrical strips. The down comforter was so heavy and hot you couldn't sleep under it, and there was no top sheet on the bed, so it was cover or nothing. Noisy A/C too.Next morning I asked the receiption to please have housekeeping remove the comforter and put a top sheet and blanket on the bed. This was at 9:00 am. I asked again at 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm. Finally after my third call housekeeping brought me a sheet and blanket.This to me is no 4 star hotel."

"Review_11436","hotel_122","hotel_8685","Aug 30, 2008","2nd Time at this hotel, very centrally located Our second stay at this hotel (our last one being in 2006 when the hotel was undergoing some serious renovations) and we were keen to see how the hotel had been upgraded.  As Sofitel Members we should be upgraded but unfortunately at check in there were no upgrades available, they were going to check and hopefully move us the next day. Only received one complimentary drink voucher (normally receive two) and when brought this to their attention a second was delivered. Our room was very small but with a great view over the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood sign, but very very small. My husband went back down and complained and we were moved to a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the Beverly Centre shopping centre, not as good a view but certainly a much bigger room. The Sofitel never disappoints and the service is consistent with other Sofitel hotels we have stayed in around the world. The beds were extremely comfortable and all facilities in the bathroom including robes and slippers were of the normal Sofitel Standard. Again free internet and complimentary water were given. The Stone Bar (Cindy Crawfords husband designed it) was a happening place at night, a bit too noisy for us late in the night but a great place to have a drink before heading out at night, try and get one of the little booths outside and if not then a table outside. Check out the outside fire place with the dry ice - incredible at nightThe breakfasts were reasonably priced for Hotel standard and of a good standard, we had exceptional service the first day but the second day we had to chase up our meal twice, not good, however, the Restaurant Manager apologised and this meal was given to us complimentary, so couldn't complain. The concierge staff were very good,in particular arranging a Mustang Convertible car for us for one day with very short notice and the staff were always pleasant and very helpful.This is a good central hotel for visitors as the public transport system (if you need it) is accessible out the front, the Farmers Markets and Grove Shopping Centre are about a $8.00 - $10.00 cab trip down the road, or a bus trip and you can also get a bus to Santa Monica from outside in the Street ( you need to change buses). The renovations have been completed to a modern contemporary standard and we would stay at this hotel again. Lots of good restaurants around including the newly opened Gordon Ramsay The London In West Hollywood, again about $8.00 cab fare from the hotel.. We had dinner there (about two months after it opened) and the food was excellent, very small portion sizes so if you have the al carte you might want to order four or five courses. The Service could have been better and overall the restaurant was not up to the standard of his New York one, but it was a dining experience, a little more laid back style - but no Candy Trolley - which was exceptional in the New york Resturant Not far from the Hotel is The Ivy restaurant and the Concierge staff can normally get you a reservation, whilst we did not eat there on this trip (2006 was enough as the food was fine but the service not great and their attitude was poor and quite agressive if you felt the service didnt warrant a huge tip) if you want to see the Paparazzi in action this is the street to be in,. We drove by one night and both sides of the Street was Pap heaven, there were people and flash lights everywhere. Overall would recommend this hotel due to location and standard Sofitel exceptional service."
"Review_11437","hotel_122","hotel_4636","Aug 28, 2008","Great hotel, terrible room The hotel itself was nice. The staff were all wonderful. They were very nice and helpful. Always saying hi, opening doors for you, making good recommendations for restaurants, ect. The facilities were nice too. Everything was clean, nothing was falling apart, no complaints there. The massage I had at the spa was great. The spa itself was great, the fitness room was great, the restaurant was great, the room was great...except for the noise.That's what made it get 2 stars. I was on the fifth floor facing Beverly Blvd and it was like being in the middle of New York city! It is near the hospital, and it's a busy road, so that explains it. There was no noise from other guests, just the road but that's enough to keep you up at night. If you're lucky, maybe you can be moved to another room. But for the purpose of this review, it is about the room I was in. And there's a lot of other rooms that would have the same problem.As some advice, if you stay here, make sure you don't have a view of Beverly Dr. Don't drink the 5$ still water in the minibar, there's free water at the gym. There's free internet at the gym, so depending on your purpose for using the internet you can avoid the WiFi fee. If you even move the drinks in the minibar (like if you were using it as a fridge for leftover food) they will charge you for it even if you don't open the bottles, so be prepared to tell that to the checkout people."

It's very busy with a funky contemporary feel. The staff were mostly friendly, although some on the door were bordering on snooty. It's obviously becoming one of the places to be seen in LA, both in the hotel and the bar. We often saw a group of bodyguards escorting someone famous around the hotel.The room although slightly small was comfortable and the shower was a fantastic overhead rain type.The food was very tasty and priced as you would expect at a fine restaurant. Personally I would have liked a buffet type option at breakfast but that鈥檚 a minor gripe as the menu catered for all tastes. Waiters and greeters in the restaurant were the most friendly staff in the hotel.Valet parking only, which although I can understand that they need to do this to compete with the best I would have liked a self parking facility also.Would stay again, but would prefer to try elsewhere first."

After they had accidentally lost our web booking they made up for it by upgrading our room. The service was great and the hotel itself superb.Our room and bathroom was a good size with a huge shower and a view looking out onto the hollywood hills. The room was modern and stylish! The hotel was also conveniently located, across the road was the Beverley shopping centre with every luxury store you could think of, as well as being walking distance to a few popular streets.The hotel restaurant was fantastic, with lovely decor and great food. There was also a very popular and equally lovely decorated bar/lounge which we enjoyed visiting. For those wanting a day spa experience there was a beautiful day spa located just outside, but affiliated with, the hotel.All in all it was a great stay and one we are sure to recommend to others. The only draw back was the cost for parking and having to tip the valets every time you needed you car, but hey, its LA!"
"Review_11442","hotel_122","hotel_6419","Jul 18, 2008","Best bed in the world! We stayed in a deluxe room, with a view of the Hollywood sign. The room was spacious enough for a city hotel, with a very large bathroom. The walk-in shower could easily have accomodated 3 people and what's more, with a flick of a switch you could watch the TV in the bedroom through the window!The best thing about the room by far was the bed! Large and very comfortable due to the feather filled mattress topper, duvet and pillows (all hypo-allergenic so no sneezing!), I have not slept in a nicer bed anywhere.The hotel staff were very attentive and the concierge was excellent. The valet parking always had the car ready in no time at all, and in Formula 1 style, 5 guys would be opening doors for you!The bar was very cool and on certain nights impossible to get into, unless of course you were either the owner of a Lambourghini...or a hotel resident!The location, in West Hollywood, was perfect for seeing the main sights of LA and nowhere was more than a half an hour's drive away.I highly recommend this hotel, especially if you are looking for a little luxury. If you think it is expensive for what you get, then you clearly should be staying in a Travel Inn!"

"Review_11444","hotel_122","hotel_10506","Jun 4, 2008","pretty close to perfect I had fallen in love with the Sofitel in Chicago so I was curious to see how the one in L.A. stacked up and once again I was blown away.The management and staff were extremely accomodating and helpful, room service was quick (get Simon's junk food selection with cotton candy and cupcakes and order in a movie one night), the pool was the warmest heated pool I had ever gone swimming in, the architecture and design of the hotel, spa, restaurant and bar was beautiful, and we even had a celebrity spotting--Ice T!The hotel is right across the street from the Beverly Center so we had plenty of choices for shopping and restaurants but it's still quite a walk to Rodeo Drive and other hot spots.And don't let cab drivers scam you from LAX! It should only be $40 and we paid $71! That was the only time I gritted my teeth during our stay but that wasn't the hotel's fault it was our own and the shady cab driver's.A soak in their suite's hot tub though did the trick. If you get a suite, the huge bathroom has a tv by the tub and I took advantage of it every day. Such a wonderful experience, I hope to return soon."
"Review_11445","hotel_122","hotel_6026","Jun 3, 2008","Great location, not great room My husband and I spent 4 nights at this hotel. We booked this hotel based on reviews we have read. The location is great for shopping on Robertson - the trendy boutique street, also home of the celeb dining hot spot - Ivy. I was disappointed by the rooms, although the bathrooms were nice. The size of the room was too small. The bed was extremely comfortable, though. It took forever to get our rooms made up each day - at least 3 p.m. before we got daily housekeeping service, which is disapointing.Also disappointing is the distance of the pool and spa from the hotel rooms. It is a LONG walk, no matter what room you are in. We did not try out the bar or restaurant, though the decor was quite appealing."

"Review_11447","hotel_122","hotel_9226","May 21, 2008","Great Choice for our young family We stayed 2 nights in a SoFabSuite on a Universal Studios stopover enroute to the UK. We're both 38 and we have an 11 month old and a 3 year old and needed a room large enough to comfortably fit us all without disturbing anyone trying to sleep. The Sofitel LA looked as though it fitted the bill and indeed did.At first we thought we'd been upgraded as the room was so nice (from memory the room was AU$330 per night-ish), large SAFE balcony, two large LCD/Plasma tv's, great bathroom and furnishings etc (you'll see on the website)Our 3yo slept like a princess in the feathery mass that the sofabed became over night. Our 11month old had a PROPER cot/crib (not a travel cot) and his own toiletries, which fitted nicely into a little dark alcove away from the 3 year old. All leaving us with a room (and to DH's joy, a large TV) to ourselves.Concierge (Hector  the Team) had organised our pickups to/from the LAX and Burbank prior to us arriving . Needing 2 carseats for the kids is an issue in California as taxis etc. don't provide them. We didn't want to hire a car and argue directions for 2 days on the wrong side of the road and AirShuttle transfers with 2 kids, associated luggage for a month RTW and stroller wasn't appealing either. They found a Limo service which could provide a babyseat at the least. DH and DD(3) enjoyed the sweets and drinks provided, and we all felt like we were doing the LA experience on the 35 minute ride to the hotel.We ate breakfast twice at SimonLA in the outside courtyard, which offered good choices for us all (inc. the baby) at what seemed like reasonable prices (before taxes, tipping etc). We also had room-service after our day at Universal, which was yummy and a had a child-friendly menu.The only thing against the hotel ais: it's location - there's really nothing other than the Beverley Centre nearby. Even finding cheap evening food choices for a family was difficult. We did eventually find a wonderful Thai cafe with the BEST egg-rolls we've ever had (and in Sydney Thai restaurants are a time a dozen). The Beverley Centre was good for a bit of quick shopping which was all we had time for in a 48h stopover which included Universal Studios.Getting to Universal on public transport was EASY and took less than an hour! We took the 25c bus right outside the hotel to Hollywood/Highland then 1 stop on the redline. The shuttle up the hill came quickly. The 25c bus took us through West Hollywood, up the strip etc so was a good little sightsee!The only other hotels we considered were the Hilton Universal (a Club room) and the Beverley Garland. Overall we feel that staying at Sofitel LA was a better choice for a such a short stay, we really felt like we were in LA!"
"Review_11448","hotel_122","hotel_1185","May 17, 2008","Great service but not worth the price I stayed in a one bedroom suite a few weeks ago (May 2008). The service in the hotel is impeccable, they do try very hard to make you feel as if you are in a 5 star hotel. The suites, however, are not worth the exhorbitant price. Noise is a problem if you're sensitive to it. My first room was very pretty (with a deep tub), but there was a persistent (24 hours a day) humming noise rising from the fans at the restaurant below. I was moved to another suite without the tub, and for the same price, but no fan noise. The busses start roaring up La Cienega at about 6am, so I was not at my best for meetings all day. En suite dining is limited but pretty well prepared (nouvelle, not a lot on the plate, but well cooked.). There are better hotels for this price."

The service staff are friendly and efficient and the hotel and rooms are very clean. In my opinion, the double-bed room was surprisingly small. I guess for the price per night, I expected it to be bigger. I am a Sofitel rewards member; however, they neglected to provide me with the membership benefits even though my rewards status was clearly provided on the reservation. The bedroom windows open out to a main street and the Beverly Center is directly across the street, so great shopping is close. I didn't like the fact that the window looks like it has a balcony, but it doesn't, and one misstep could land you on your face in the street below. There's a Rande Gerber bar/lounge in the lobby that is frequented by the young and beautiful Los Angelenos. If you stay at the hotel you cross the velvet rope hassle-free. They also have a really nice restaurant with an outdoor patio which is perfect for brunch. Overall, the hotel was nice. Definitely not the best hotel I've stayed in, but certainly not the worst - just pricey. If it had cost less, my review would be more positive."

"Review_11454","hotel_122","hotel_4560","Apr 12, 2008","A Modern Gem in L.A.! I just attended a work meeting at the Sofitel in L.A. Let me start by saying that I live in L.A. all my life (37 years) and have seen many hotel both in L.A. and around the country. The Sofitel is a very modern, upscale hotel since the remodel. Everything from the lobby accents to the rooms are polished to a high sheen. Check in was easy as was check out. We used several meeting rooms while there and the catering service was outstanding. Food was top notch and the service always came with a smile. Actually, that theme spread throughout the hotel. I have to say I was not expecting a hotel in this area to have such a friendly, outgoing staff. Everyone who worked there greeted me as I walked by. They really made you feel welcome. We had over 50 people in town for our meetings from around the country and those I spoke to gave grand reviews. I think the location is very good. You have the Beverly Center just South for shopping and a lot of food and entertainment within walking distance. You're close enough to the Sunset Strip to jump a short cab ride to get there but far enough to stay away from it if you don't want to be right in the thick of Hollywood.It's L.A. so things are a little pricey but you do get the best. Room service was delicious. The bar/lounge is very cool. Wed night is the big night at the Stone Rose lounge. It gets BEYOND packed.The only note I would make if I returned would be to get a room on the South side of the hotel. There is a school as other reviewers have mentioned. It's located on the North side of the hotel where my room was. I had to be up early for meetings anyway but the noise from the school on weekday mornings could be an issue for anyone who wished to sleep in.A fantastic place with great customer service!"

The staff could not do enough for us despite only staying one evening and needing plenty of support regarding late checkout, baggage hold, etc. Our room was every bit as good as it looked on the web. Will definitely stay here next time. All staff were friendly and polite.

The biggest problem is the location - right next to a major hospital so that you'll be up all night with the sound of sirens on the street below. Maybe there are quieter rooms in the hotel? Also, the rooms are really small-ish and the beds not very comfortable. This place can be a bargain - especially since it is outside of Beverly Hills - but you get what you pay for.

It is a nice hotel, but the rooms on the mall side of the building are loud (no noise glass, french doors that didn't even close all the way) , small and not very special. The lobby is very dark and pretentious. The surrounding immediate area offers nothing except a mall, nothing of interest or charm is walkable from the hotel (I know it is LA, but still...). Though expensive, the restaurant does do a delicious breakfast. The concierge gave excellent directions and was very helpful in general. It wasn't a bad place, but it lacked charm, quiet and distinction. I would not stay there again."

It is located directly across the road from Beverly Shopping Centre so it is definately a convenient location for some shopping. l believe there are other hotels in better locations(ie Santa Monica) with better views(the view from my room was basically the shopping centre). I stayed in an executive suite and the room was decent. It was slightly smaller than l expected..the suite photos shown on the internet show a larger lounge room however my lounge area was quite small. The balcony was overlooking the street and the Beverly Centre. The bedroom was large, clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The bathrooms were decent sized with a tv above the bath - very nice.

The gentleman manning the desk informed me that the room I had been assigned would not accommodate the cribs, but that he would be happy to change my room. The room was gorgeous and had a large shower and a great view of the hills behind the hotel. The cribs arrived shortly after we made it to our room and came loaded with baby shampoos, lotions and powder. We made use of the valet parking $23 a night, and met some of the nicest valets ever.

The morning-after breakfast/brunch scene in the restaurant was a hangover gone bad, with too loud music (DJ brunch? Obnoxious.), pretentious and pricey menu, and staff attitude. With so many hotel choices in this area, this one can be overlooked."
"Review_11465","hotel_122","hotel_3232","Jan 29, 2008","Goos times at the Sofitel Good staff. Attentive and sorted out a housekeeping oversight quickly and with a free breakfast. It was a bad oversight.Look/Feel. It's modern and refurbished. Like any hotel its worn but overall very nice. The beds are to die for. The shower heads (rain type) all need to be replaced due to shoddy manufacturing. They spray the roof causing bubbling paint and cold water to drip. Ask for the side with the view of the hills.The location is good. Easy to get cabs, away from the noise of the strip, close to the fun places you want to go.The Gerber Bar is cool. Would be fantastic in summer outside. Cody behind the bar is sweet and fun.We were three single guys with friends in LA. We found Sofitel to be just right. New, coolish, close w a good bar. We'll be back."

This is a great hotel, right next to the Beverly Centre for shopping, and a few blocks from Melrose Ave (my preferred shopping area). We arrived late, checked-in swiftly and loved our comfy room and great view of the West Hollywood Hills. Has a great bar and outdoor patio area with canopy seating and an open fireplace. Great Sushi place on the same block as hotel that I can't now remember the name.

We got a great internet rate on a basic level room. We requested a view of the Hollywood sign and got that too. From the moment we walked through the lobby, we knew this place would be great. The reception staff were great. And a special thank you to Claudia on the Concierge desk - her recommendations were spot on, could get us bookings at short notice for good restaurants, and was always happy to help us out.The room had a really comfortable bed, and modern appliances. It also had a great bathroom with one of those huge shower roses which had fantastic water pressure. The gym is also the best equipped I've seen at a hotel.A great stay!"

"Review_11470","hotel_123","hotel_10210","Dec 25, 2008","Loved the Hyatt, stylish and functional Just returned from a long day at the Hyatt, and really loved it. I primarily chose it because of its location (across the street from where I was going), but from the second I pulled up to the entrance I was impressed with the service, style and functionality of the hotel.Staff was efficient and friendly in an understated sort of way. They generally left you alone (I think they primarily cater to people there on business), but were always friendly and provided useful advice. Yes, valet is $33 a day (there is self-park a 2 minute walk away for $20 each time you go in or out), but that is pretty typical for this kind of a location. The valet guys were helpful with local area advice, and they got my car super fast.I stayed in a Regency Club room and loved it. I actually don't know if the rooms are any different than normal rooms, but you get access to the Regency Club in the lobby that has free breakfast in the morning, drinks throughout the day, and appetizers in the evening. It also has free Wi-Fi access and 2 computers with a printer - very handy. It's a very functional room, affording a surprising amount of privacy for business conversations. I LOVED the room. I was on the 18th floor - not sure if this is a special Regency floor or not, but it was great. Very wide and stylishly appointed hallway that slightly curves so it feels smaller and more personable.I had an even numbered room, and those look out west towards the ocean and the sunset. Checked in around 3pm as the sun was starting to set, and the whole room was just washed in glorious sunlight. Great views towards the pool area and then all the way to Santa Monica. Had no trouble seeing Catalina, even though it wasn't a particularly clear day. Very expansive view. Loved the balcony, which they call the lanai. It is very large and has a carpet, feels very cozy.Room is huge, tons of space, everything very functional and fresh looking. Nice big plasma TV (which I didn't even turn on). Big, luxurious and modern bathroom. Only two complaints about the room are that (1) the water pressure in the sink (but not the shower) was very low, and (2) the mp3 attachment for the clock radio was crappy and there was interference when I tried to play my Zune.Very convenient location - there is a fancy open air mall a 5 minute walk away that has a ton of dining options, from food court to very fancy. UCLA, Beverly Hills, Hollywood - all are only minutes away.The pool area looked fabulous. I only got to relax out there for a little bit. It had that old-Europe beach club feel to it. Pool was seriously heated - I was there Dec 22 and people were swimming in it at 9pm. Also has a nice big outdoor Jacuzzi.Overall, I really loved everything about the hotel and will definitely be back."

"Review_11473","hotel_123","hotel_8994","Nov 30, 2008","Impersonal but grows on you A functional hotel for the business community, it can easily make the tourist who is not dressed for the office or in a noisy group feel they are not in the right place. It seemed that any small talk by the reception staff would be a dismissible offence and even after five days there was no sign of our being recognised. This approach however may be preferred by others, the hotel being sited between the MGM tower and Fox studios. A report of a dud bulb in the bathroom was dealt with promptly and when we brought a bottle of wine into the room, glasses appeared without request.Once we persuaded the concierge that we really did not want to hire a car and pay the exorbitant hotel parking fees he was very helpful in showing us how to walk to Rodeo Drive (10-15minutes away) where you can get a 45 minute tour of the stars homes on a tram for a fraction of the cost of the coach tours that collect you from the hotel. Outside the hotel are regular buses to Santa Monica (cost 75cents), the Farmers Market ($1.25), and Hollywood ($1.25). The bus guide tells you to catch two buses to Hollywood but if you are willing to take a ten minute walk at the Hollywood end you save time and money.The garden; outside swimming pool and Jacuzzi are all one would expect of a good hotel but they need to sort out their catering facilities with e.g. the coffee shop run by Starbucks closing at 3.00pm. It feels like the management is dominated by accountants, but for all its faults, what the hotel did provide, was provided very well. By mixing what the hotel did well with the food hall And supermarket at Century Plaza shopping centre on the other side of the road our satisfaction with the hotel grew through our stay.St8sman Essex"
"Review_11474","hotel_123","hotel_9737","Nov 28, 2008","Stylish Hotel, but Unfriendly Service We booked this hotel, after seeing the rooms and amenities on the website. There are good and bad with the hotel.The Good:- Stylish hotel. Modern decor and clean rooms. We were on the Regency Club floor and had a beautiful view of Los Angeles. It got noisy though, with the large buses that park outside of the hotel.- Drinks in the Lobby bar were good. The dessert was mediocre, but the service was good.- Fitness center is well equipped with plenty of cardio machines. If you are a Diamon member, it's free. Otherwise, it's a pricey $20/day.- Lobby is bustling and busy. Active area.- Westfield Mall is 2 blocks away - incredibly convenient.The Bad:- Service, Service, and more Service. The front desk reception was rude and cold. We asked for other options outside of the Regency Club, and they said there were none. We went to the Concierge and asked for other options, and they said there's no other options -- even though the sign outside of the Regency Club specifically says to see Concierge for other options. (This was Thanksgiving Day, and the Club was closed.)We asked the hostess at Breeze Restaurant if we can just have dessert, and her immediate answer was No. She just looked at us, and didn't offer any other option. All in all, it was a rude reception.- The Hyatt charged us for drinks and food that were delivered to our room, even though it was free for Diamond Club Members. We had to go to the front desk to remove the charges.- No car parking. There is valet, but they charge $31/day. (We parked next door, which is $20/day.)The next day, the staff was much friendlier. However, we've already had a foul experience.I recommend the hotel for location and decor, but not for service."

Whilst the rooms  facilties of this hotel look standard the reality is somewhat different. Much has been outsourced and is not integrated well for guests and is 'user-pay'.The fitness centre and spa, widely advertised by Hyatt, both in their hotel description and Concierge email service, is a completely seperate business and hotel guests are treated no differently from the general public. In fact you can't even transit the facility, the easiest way to the nearby mall and hotel grounds, as the spa staff actively 'police' the entrance and send you round the street. This is false advertising by Hyatt and they should be held to task. The gym which is good is a $15 charge per visit - $30 a day for our room. I consider that expensive.The pool has the landscaping of the local carpark, inadequate  poor pool service and again the cafe, which serves the best range of juices and food, is a seperate business and only takes cash , not charge. None of this is clearly explained and you are left to 'stumble' around finding things out for your self.Request for extra towels went unanswered 3 times, taking a trip to the ever-helpful front desk staff to resolve the issue. Worth pointing out that the service here is exemplary.Car parking is $27 per day, again amongst the total additional charges, adding to the daily bill as a car is a necessity for this location.No in-room coffee/tea means that the 'in-house' Starbucks is an additional charge.This is an expensive hotel, with poor service requiring many additional charges for the average stay - wouldn't stay here again as there are many options more worthy in the local area."

When I reported the incorrect charges to the front desk I was advised my account would be corrected, however when I subsiquently checked my credit card I was disappointed to see the charges were still there.

Because I didn't leave a tip, the housekeeping staff racked up almost $30 worth of mini-bar charges to my room as retribution. This is despicable for a higher caliber hotel like the Hyatt.

"Review_11485","hotel_123","hotel_6679","Sep 6, 2008","The More You Spend, The Less You Get... I have found my aforementioned title, The More You Spend, The Less You Get to be painfully true in my last week of travels.We stayed here on Thursday, September 4th. The hotel is very impressive. The lobby is beautiful, and the rooms are awesome (We stayed on the 18th floor). It is the little things that peeved me.Internet cost ya, no coffee make in your room, no business center, room service is highway robbery, in room items are highway robbery, and valet is a joke.People pay all this money to stay here and yet the most basic creature comforts are not included or cost a ridiculous price. I needed to use a computer with a printer to print Dodger tickets... I was sent down to the business center (After paying $10 bucks for internet in my room) and was charged $7 for using their internet for about 40 seconds, and printing three pages (my tickets). No one thought it would be nice to help a customer out. The concierge blew me off when I asked, and the front desk had no idea.If there is a lesson to be learned it is this. If you want to pay a lot of money to stay at a cool hotel that is fine. But don't expect nearly the same service, amenities you will get at a Holiday Inn or Comfort Inn. Sad this is the case, but hands down the smaller guy on the block offers a lot more for the buck then the big dog. For me and my girlfriend it is a lesson learned. Hope this guides you in the right direction.-Mike"
"Review_11486","hotel_123","hotel_6688","Sep 4, 2008","nice hotel, ripoff extras This is a very nice hotel - there is no question about that. The elevators are very fast and rooms are comfortable. The lobby is nice and it's cool having a real Starbucks right in the hotel, though I though it odd that it was not open when we checked in at 4:00 p.m.However, I have to warn you that the Hyatt (and similar hotels) have designed ways to get as much money out of you from the moment you check in until the moment you leave. As others have mentioned, valet parking is $31. When you drive in, the sign says valet and grayed out are the words self park. In other words, they have removed that option from the front of the hotel. You can drive around the block and find the garage and park there at $10 a day but you will pay $10 each time you come and go (the hourly rate reverts to a daily rate after two hours). Anyway, the process is by design to get you to valet park and pay $31 (+ tips).Next, there is a hi-tech mini bar in the room but there are no prices on the snacks. If you pick up a bag of potato chips looking for the price, you might be charged for them because the minibar detects removal of an item and automatically bills your room for it. It says that on the glass door, but you might not notice that (as we didn't).I didn't get internet access, though I normally do. However, I'm sure they charge it. I wish organizations such as the Hyatt looked at their customers as customers rather than simply revenue sources. You can have such a wonderful stay in such a wonderful hotel but what sticks in your craw are the various scenarios where the hotel is seeking to take more of your money at outrageous rates compared to the rendered service."

I would stay here again in a heartbeat, especially at the rate of $115 a night I secured on priceline. Beware that the gym costs $20 a day if you want to use it.

We get there and everyone on line to check in was mad. The hotel staff kept apologizing to people. I knew I was in for something. They apparently booked all of the double bed rooms for some cheerleading competition that was going on at their hotel. Because they have a contract with them, they had to bump everyone even though we booked it in January. They told me they could give us a room with one king size bed and send up a cot. We are four adults! Three of us had to squeeze on one bed?? Not going to happen. So one of us slept on the cot, another on a chair and ottoman. They couldn't give us another cot because it was a fire hazard. They also explained to me that the hotel does not guarantee a bed type, the only guarantee a room type. I never heard of that before. Then, when we got to the room and there were no towels at all! Luckily, I was nosey and opened up the doors to a cabinet in the middle of the hallway and saw a bunch of towels. so we took them from there. Then the thick curtain that keeps the sun out was missing! Luckily we were on the side of the building that the sun sets on. They ended up comping us that entire night but still, that was wrong. They only comped us for the night AFTER we called to complain about the curtain."

It is extremely convenient to my firm's LA office which is why I've stayed there, but I think this time was the last.As has been mentioned before, the rooms are very nice: the finishes are high-end, with granite countertops and gorgeous flat screen TVs. The rooms have very nice balconies and no matter which way your room faces, it's nice to be able to sit outside. The beds are also very comfortable. However, all this is negated by bad housekeeping. My bathroom floor this time was covered in hair. Not just little stray hairs, but lots of long, black hair which was impossible to miss. I did not arrive until really late, so I just took a towel and wiped them up myself, which I immediately regretting doing. When I lifted the towel, it was clear that the floor had not been washed in a while. UGH. The next morning, as I was getting ready to take my shower, I looked for the first time at the towel rack in the tub area, and realized that both towels there were used. DOUBLE UGH. I called housekeeping and while they were up in a flash with clean towels, I was disgusted beyond belief. As I left for the day, I reported all of this to the front desk, and when I got back, there was a message from housekeeping apologizing - sort of. It said they were sorry *if* their housekeeping did not meet my standards. I am pretty sure this doesn't meet anyone's standards, and the if in the apology sounded hedgey to me. Anyway, I was leaving at 5 the next morning and did not have the time or inclination to pursue it further. Unfortunately, the worst was yet to come, when at 4:30 that next morning I tried to take a shower only to find that there was no hot water. I got a tepid shower, but my colleague could not even get tepid water on her floor. She reported it and the hotel accomodated her with a credit, but still - it was a lousy way to start a long travel day. In any case, the long and short of it is that I've had 2 nice stays at this hotel and 1 pretty bad one, so I am giving it an Average rating. Any hotel can be off on occasion, but the cleanliness issue probably pushes me to try the Intercontintal up the street next time."

We had a poolside view on the 10th floor that enabled a wonderful scope of LA, as well as, the sunset (not to be confused with Sunset Blvd.). The bed was amazingly comfortable. The flat screen TV and granite countertops on all the surfaces gave the room quite a luxurious feel. Our room did not include a bathrobe, coffeepot, or glassware. I think it's weird that the more you pay, the less amenities you get. I guess they make up for it in the furniture and environment. I do prefer a non-odorous, luxurious room without coffee over a malodorous room with hair on the bathroom countertops with a coffeepot that you would prefer to keep away from anyhow."

My husband used the wireless internet here, while the kids and I chilled and watched on of the tv's. Our check in was great, we were able to check in at noon, when check in is normally 3pm!The parking is a pain, but what are you going to do, it's LA. We paid the $31 with in and out privilages. The valet service is very fast and friendly.The pool area is amazing. There is a covered lounge area with a bar. They have a fireplace they lite a night. The pool was an infinity edge pool, and the hot tub was large enough to fit 12. The tanning pools were really cool! They provide towels by the pool and it was open until 10pm, but we were there longer the night we stayed and no one told us to leave.Our room was on the 15th floor and faced the street with an office building and fountain across the street. This view was fine for us, the kids just liked sitting out on the balcony. The beds were very confortable, not too soft, like most hotels lately. The room was decorated very nicely and was confortable. We did not eat at the hotel after reading all the other review about how pricey it was.

For my $1000 3 night bill, I expect free coffee. I did not see a hair dryer in my room. Perhaps that is another appliance upon request. My room had a nice balcony and view overlooking the pool.

Let me be clear I don't mind the charge. Some people are so shocked that hotels charge for parking. The valet attendants are lazy. Let me explain how it works. You call down x 2500 for your car. The valets get the car We never had an issue with getting our car. The probem occurs when you drop it off. The Valets never come over to your car they make you get out in the middle of the driveway. They never seem to move the car. The other cars try to squeeze by . This causes traffic jams for other guests as there are 750 room. I can't prove but there ws a slight dent on the driver door of my rental. Luckily I had the rental ins otherwise they would have charged my cc until i contacted my insurance at home."

Firstly, it's a minute or two, literally, from Beverly Hills and it is convenient to Hollywood and Santa Monica. Secondly, it is a two minute walk (yes, I said walk, although you never walk when in LA) from a wonderful shopping mall. Finally, Century City provides you the luxury of Beverly Hills, the safety you need and proximity to major freeways.The rooms are beautiful and spacious 鈥?huge closets, deluxe bathrooms, really comfortable beds, state of the art technology.

"Review_11506","hotel_123","hotel_6260","May 13, 2008","Overpriced in the middle of nowhere First of all, unless you need to be in Century city, there is no reason to stay here. Far from everything, hardly any place of interest within walking distance. Check in went well. When we got to the room, there was a coffee maker on the floor right outside the door. The rooms do not have coffee makers, but you can ask for one. This one was however used, and the staff had forgotten to take it. Well into the room I found that the beds were double, not queens, and that does make a dfference (of 6 inches, to be exact!) when travelling with a husband and two children. The minibar has sensors that charge for every movement of its contents, so you can not use it to keep milk or yogurt for the children, for instance.Went down to the pool to find it in need of renovation (and cleaning!). The pool is not very large, considering the size of the hotel. There are some wading pools, but they were constantly used by ducks!! Good thing my children are past that age!The food at the restaurant was good, but somewhat overpriced. The coffee maker found outside the door when we arrived was still there 24 hours later! Called housekeeping and asked them to remove it, which took an extra couple of hours... Service was in general rather poor."

I was impressed with the hotel upon arrival-- cool 60s architecture and glamorous lobby. My room felt huge compared to the small European hotel rooms I'd been staying in previously. I had a high floor with a nice view of LA. Balcony is a bonus. The whole hotel has a very 60s Watergate feel to it, which is cool in my book. Bathroom is spacious and well-appointed. My only complaint arises out of my treatment in the morning, when I went out to buy some drugstore items and planned on returning to the room to conduct some business before checking out at 11. I had put my suitcase in the car, and when I returned to the room at 9 AM the maids were busy cleaning the room. I told them that I had not checked out yet, and they were quite uppity with me, acting as though I had no right to be there and that I was disrupting their cleaning routine. It seemed to me that they were overly aggressive with me, and at the least, should have respected my right to return when I re-entered. Next time I'll make sure to keep the Do Not Disturb sign on the door until the last moment."
"Review_11508","hotel_123","hotel_3041","May 3, 2008","A terrible hotel! I stayed 6 nights at this hotel recently. It was one of the worst experiences I have had. The hotel is, at best, a 4 star hotel, although its prices suggest otherwise. Check-in (at 11.30am) was very slow, with only 2 personnel despite a queue of 10 people. I was then given a very small room. When I called the front desk to ask why, I was put on hold for 25 minutes. I was then told that there were in fact much larger rooms available, and I was moved to one of these rooms. I was not however told that the larger rooms were very warm as the air-conditioning units were small and old (I was helpfully told this by the engineering personnel later). It took 3 complaints for engineering to finally come and let me know that they could not do anything. Having already settled in by then, and with numerous meetings to attend, I reluctantly opted to stay in the room. Service throughout the hotel was uniformally slow, and it was clear that the hotel is under-staffed. At the outdoor areas of the lobby bar and the X-bar, it was not uncommon to wait 25 minutes before getting served; this is unacceptable by any standards. Breakfast was also mediocre and was certainly not commensurate with the prices charged. The door personnel generally tended to ignore people waiting for taxis unless it was brought to their attention that taxis were required. Most suprisingly, considering that this hotel is predominantly a business hotel, the business centre (which was basically a small shop offering limited facilities rather than a proper business centre) was only open limited hours on weekdays, half a day on Saturday and closed on Sunday. On the last day, I checked out at 12pm as required. Since my flight was only at midninght, I asked wheher it would be possible to have shower facilities provided before I left later in the evening (which is a common practice at good business hotels in various countries), but unsurprisingly I was told that they could not offer these facilities.I think that the hotel is a rip-off, and is definitely inadequate for the needs of business travellers. I will never stay here again."
"Review_11509","hotel_123","hotel_6973","Apr 28, 2008","Totally fine hotel I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza for a week this past February. The lobby and main areas are very clean and well kept. We initially had a room on a lower floor but requested, and were promptly moved, to an upper floor facing the pool. I would not recommend the street side, as this faces a somewhat noisy main road with a view of the office building across the street. The room itself was a decent size and well maintained. The bath products were above average. The shower was fine, nothing special or bad. The staff at this hotel was very nice and helpful.The pool and hot tub area was very nice, and there were always plenty of clean towels on hand. The reflecting pools were cool, especially if you are into tanning.The location of this hotel is well situated for getting around L.A. You would definitely need a car, but I think this would be true for anywhere in this city. There is a decent shopping mall with a good grocery store on the lower level two blocks away. This is a good place to buy water and things that are priced much much higher at the hotel convenience store (which seemed to be closed fairly often anyhow).All in all, a fine, but not extraordinary, place to stay."
"Review_11510","hotel_123","hotel_9547","Apr 25, 2008","Good Place to Stay Stayed at the Hyatt Century Plaza on a weekend. We booked through Priceline and got a good rate. Hotel was really nice and clean and relatively close to local amenities. You are on the edge of Beverly Hills and not more than 20-30 minutes to most Hollywood/LA attractions. Don't know that I would pay the regular rate for this hotel which is about $300+ per night. We paid about 1/2 the regular rate on Priceline so it was worth it for that money. The bed was comfortable with a balcony, flat panel TV and was well appointed with nice finishes in the bath. Beautiful lobby and from what I understand, celebs occasionally meet there for business. Unfortunately, it was a little cool outside so we did not have occasion to utilize the pool or outdoor amenities. Valet parking is a little pricey at $30 per day but is convenient. They bring the car in and out and you just get out at the front. We stayed there on a weeked. Century City is a little bit of a business district so on the weekends its kind of a ghost town. However, there is a large mall right next door for shopping, eating, etc, which is open on the weekends. When we left on Monday morning, there was quite a bit of activity as business resumed. All in all, a good experience and for a discounted rate, I would stay again."

They now have automated check-in at a kiosk, which I found quite impersonal and unwelcoming.Our room was fine, yet they use paper cups in the baths and no other glasses are available in the room. On our second day, the maid threw away our papercups and did not replace them. Maybe she was mad because we had to call at 5pm since our room had not yet been cleaned.The towels are not the kind you would expect with this level of a hotel. No thick, plush stuff here, just serviceable K-Mart towels.We wanted to use the pool on Saturday, but all seats were filled. There was no shade anyway, so it wouldn't have mattered.Saturday night we had to wait a good 20 minutes for the valet line as they seemed quite understaffed. Valet parking is now $31 a night and self-parking is so inconvenient as not to be a choice.It's still a nice hotel, the rooms well-furnished except for the cups and towels.

The furnishings were well appointed and the bathroom was all marble, but the entire suite really needed a good cleaning and that doesn't include the housekeeper that just walked into the suite while I was undressing. I would have enjoyed this suite a little more if it hadn't been for the BED BUGS! Was really difficult to try and sleep. Also, you feel imprisoned on the property, it is difficult to just walk off the property the way it is situated and there is no self-park you must valet and that gets to be a little too much everytime you need to leave and have to wait for your car. I wish I could recommend this property, but I found it to be a real turn off!"

However they were hosting a huge wedding on the first day, and then closed the pool for a film crew on the second day. This didnt matter to us as we were going to Universal, and they did make arrangements for guests to use a nearby hotel. Actually we quite liked coming downstairs on our first morning and finding a film set! Concierge facilities were good, with complimentary breakfast, snacks, internet etc. Rooms were lovely - very comfortable beds, nice furnishings, LCD TVs. Location about 10 mins drive from Rodeo Drive, 20-25 mins from Chinese Theatre. Note that the sushi restaurant, Breeze, doesn't do sushi on a Sunday, which caught us out. However, when we complained (as the regular menu was far from satisfactory - food was over seasoned and tepid) they refunded our meal. This was appreciated! Also, the general manager was absolutely charming and very helpful."

"Review_11518","hotel_123","hotel_5878","Jan 25, 2008","Very Nice Mid-Century Styled Hotel The Century Plaza Hotel in the Century City area of L.A. is a landmark hotel that has been home to some of Hollywood's glitz and glamour for decades. The hotel's sweeping arc design has set it apart from other hotels in the area and made it an easily recognizable icon for some time. This hotel has been the choice of presidents, stars, and general business travelers and tourists alike for quite some time. So booking at this property, one should understand that it was designed and built in the 60s. Rooms are of a typical size from that era ... not very big. The bathrooms, too, are on the smallish side when compared to today's hotels. It kind of irks me when I read reviews where people moan and groan about this ... as if this was a hotel that had been built to today's standards. In all, I found my room to be superb. It wasn't huge, but it did have a lounge chair, a desk/table with two chairs, and a king size bed. The bathroom is compact, but nicely updated and clean. The room's patio was carpeted with all-weather carpeting and had two patio chairs with seat cushions. A widescreen LCD TV was provided, as was an iPod docking station.The room's decor was quite nice. It hearkened back to the mid-century roots of this hotel without being kitschy or over-done. The room appeared to be well maintained and clean ... and my standards for cleanliness are high. The staff at the hotel are well-trained in taking care of their guests. Valets were prompt and courteous (and they didn't change my radio station or move my driver's seat, thankfully). The housekeeping staff was pleasant and efficient. The front desk staff were always friendly and professional ... making good eye contact and resolving issues.The issues we had were minor. We put some items of our own into the room's mini-bar fridge ... and then saw a placard stating that if you do so, your folio will be automatically charged for the items removed. I'm not quite sure how this high-tech fridge does that ... but it does ... and the charges did show up right away. We reported that to the front desk staff on our way to dinner that night and it was taken care of promptly and even with an apology (even though it was our mistake). I was disappointed that the room didn't have a DVD player, but I phoned the hotel's concierge service and asked if one could be provided. Absolutely! We'll have it brought up right away. And it was ... within 5 minutes ... all hooked up and ready to use for our entire stay. That's service. You will read in other reviews about the location. Some will like it, others will say it isn't in the heart of anything. We enjoyed it and found the shopping and dining nearby to be just fine. There are a couple great choices in Century City ... this hotel definitely being one of them. Enjoy your trip!"

Researched the area for quite a while before booking it and im really glad that we chose this hotel. The room was fantastic, we had a view over the pool, the bed was comfy and the cleaners did a fantastic job. I loved the fact that there is a shopping center across the road which was great on a lunch time. It had Macys, bloomindales, victoria secrets and tiffanys to name a few. There is also a supermarket there which was ideal for buying magazines, water and snacks to have by the hotel pool. The pool area was nice and clean, although at the weekend they could have done with a few more sun chairs, on a week day there would only been a few people by the pool. I used the room phone once to call my mum and dad and tell them we had arrived ok and when we checked out i think they had charged us about thirty pounds for the pleaseure!!

We're from Illinois and the Fighting Illini were staying there for the Rose Bowl. You can't beat that when you're travelling with teen boys!2. The hotel has been redone, and it's really beautiful. The lobby, the grounds (were about to be finished when we were there), the rooms.3. Beds are great.4. Location is great if you want to be near Century City, or if you're driving all the time anyhow.5. I forgot to pack a pair of pants the day we left, and they were terrific about finding them and holding them until we returned later that day. This should be a matter of course for all hotels, but still their professionalism should be mentioned.6. The front desk help was generally very good.7. Free wi fi in the lobby.The bad:1. We foolishly had breakfast at the hotel, because we had a food and beverage credit as part of our rate. Service was beyond bad, and when we checked out about 1 hour later, they still hadn't charged the bill to our room. That took another hour of waiting, which made no sense at all.2. One of the rooms was boiling hot (it faced the setting sun, and when we checked in the drapes were open). Another room was freezing. Eventually this got straightened out, but it's not pleasant to check into a room that's unbearably warm.3. Location is lousy if you like to walk (other than to the mall or office buildings at Century City).4. No free wifi in the rooms."

It is also across the road from the Century Plaza mall owned by Westfield which had nice restaurants, foodcourt (upmarket), cinema, boutiques and department stores.The room:The rooms were old and tired, No coffee and tea making facilities were available.

My biggest complaints: - It took several calls and many hours to get the refrigerator we had requested in advance (it came at 1 am). - Housekeeping really shorted us on towels and toiletries and ignored our repeated requests to change the sheets. - Two different concierges were very condescending to me - Even though I did my Internet research and knew what I was talking about. - The valet service, which is really slow BTW, was at times so rude to us! Perhaps because our rental was a Ford minivan and not a BMW or Lexus. The noise from the construction site did not really bother me, but I certainly understand how it would disturb others and it did intrude on my peaceful lanai reading time. It looks like that building will be going up for a long while, FYI.Other than these problems, the rooms were very comfortable and the hotel decor is great. The location is fabulous, given the close proximity to Beverly Hills and the freeways. Also it's across the street from the fabulous Century City Westfield Mall, which has a really nice food court and great shops.

The hotel location is great as it is minutes from Beverly Hills and across the street from the Century City Shopping Center. The rooms have LCD TVs , the bed is comfortable and for the most part clean (sheets need to replaced, some are worn out). I had a room facing the back of the hotel with a view of the (very, very distant) ocean. I didn't rate this a 4 Star because the front desk staff is not very knowledgeable (didn't even know how to print out a folio!) and when you ask them for anything they just didn't know or had to always ask someone else for the answer. The Club room's continental breakfast is a joke (muffins and juice) so I wouldn't pay extra to include that in the stay and the staff is not very good about replinishing the food/drinks/plates/napkins. Often times I would go in the room to find only muffin crumbs and no plates. The bellmen and valet staff however were very efficient and consistent in providing good service. I think if they train the front staff and revamped the Club room the hotel would get higher marks."

The employee at the reception made a note of it, and told us that they have had a rodent problem in the past!! It might just be bad luck.

Bedroom block 1xx (ground)-2xx has no lift to upper floor. Did not assess block with rooms 3xx-5xx.

Check-in literally took less than 30 seconds, including when he asked if we wanted 1st or 2nd floor. The rooms are set up like they might be in warmer climates - instead of everything in one building, there were several groups of 2-story buildings with maybe 10 or so rooms in each group. There's parking on site (and it's FREE - a total luxury in Boston) and the whole time I felt safe, even parking my new car out there.The room was nothing special - not huge or anything, but it was absolutely spotless. Fridge, microwave, desk, wireless internet all right there. Even the bathroom didn't have one speck of mold or dirt. It's even environmentally friendly, with those signs you can leave out if you can handle using the towels and sheets more than once. We got directions to both walk to Fenway (it's about 1.5 miles) or take the train (T is about a 4 minute walk) and how to get back after a night of baseball and drinking. :) I would definitely stay at this hotel again, and recommend it to anyone who asked.

This place worked out great, and is fine if you are looking for a safe, clean, reasonably priced, no-frills option in Boston--which is hard to find!The room itself was larger and nicer than I expected--although the blaze orange bedspreads need to be updated.The price was fair--you could easily pay double the amount in downtown Boston.The location is in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood, just west of Kenmore Square and Fenway Park. This is great is you are visiting BU or BC, but not if you want to be right in the middle of the City center.The Green line trains are steps away, and it is about a half hour ride into the city proper--or less if you are headed to a Red Sox game or BC game.An ok breakfast was included: juice, coffee, cereal, bagels, toast, etc. Nothing unusual..The room was quiet, but I would suggest you ask to be on the inside, away from the street if possible. The staff was helpful and accomodating. All in all, not great, but not bad."

We picked it because it was the cheapest and permitted four students in one room and free parking without extra charges. The positive: one block walk to the T subway system on the Boston College line. Very nice continental breakfast with fresh bagels, muffins, hard boiled egges etc and made to order waffles. The rooms are being renovated and all three of ours were renovated. I have to say the pillows and mattresses were new comfortable and the rooms completely quiet -- I hate traffic sounds. The neighborhood behind it is up and coming, decent for a walk. Near to Newton and Boston College. Small efficiency kitchen with a fridge, microwave and dishes was handy. The desk staff were extremely helpful. Free wireless access and a free PC in the lobby for internet access. Negative: given that I was not expecting a resort, I really have nothing negative other than we were awoken at 8am on Monday morning by the rehab of a nearby room. My call to the front desk brought an apology and I was told they were not expecting the workers until 9:30am and had already asked them to stop...which they did. The other negative is that the property is a little out of the way for the main Boston sights, about a 30 minute subway ride to government center (a major depot for all lines) and about 50-60 minutes from the airport. For Harvard, the desk staff advised that we take the T four stops and switch to the 66 busline which took us right into Harvard Square.. a half hour in total. Otherwise, the T alone would have taken about an hour. I highly recommend the mulit-day passes. Our 7 day pass (covers trains and buses) for $15.00 was a good buy, considering the one way tickets on the T are $2.00. Use it to commute all over the city and to the airport. Cannot be bought at the airport but take the free shuttle to the subway and bye it there from the ticket machines."

"Review_11536","hotel_124","hotel_4721","Jan 25, 2008","Awful We found this hotel through a college website. It was listed as a hotel in the vicinity of Boston College and close to downtown Boston. We were planning a trip to see the some of the colleges in Boston and didn't want to spend a fortune...so we booked it. BIG MISTAKE. I knew we were in trouble when we saw it was practically in the parking lot of a gas station...it's just behind the Gulf station. The check in was fine, people were friendly and helpful but when I saw the room I nearly cried. It looked dirty. The room was dingy and old...really fairly run down. The bathroom had a frosted window...no curtain...that looked out on the parking lot. If you opened the bathroom window...anyone outside had a full view in.We all felt so uncomfortable that we cut our stay down from 2 nights to 1. We just couldn't sleep there.It's location is closest to Boston College but it was a bit of a trip to Boston U and NorthEastern U. What the Best Western considers a shuttle service is actually the Boston Subway system. This hotel is located on the very outskirts of Boston. It is in a rather seedy area and we really didn't feel safe waiting for the subway or walking back to the hotel at night. It took about 35 - 45 minutes by subway to get into downtown Boston. It was not a pleasant ride.We loved Boston itself , it is a great place to visit. My advice is to spend a bit more for a clean bed/bathroom and get closer to downtown."

"Review_11539","hotel_125","hotel_10250","Nov 27, 2008","Pleasant Downtown LA hotel I've had trouble finding hotels in Downtown LA which are both pleasant and reasonable. The Kyoto Grand, while hardly grand, fit that bill--I got a rate of $107. The hotel is located in (really at the edge of) Little Tokyo, probably the liveliest area of Downtown LA--one that has restaurants and stores open in the evening. At the same time it's only a few blocks from Union Station and from the Downtown core. It's a good location for a car-free traveler, which I was on this trip. It's near the Red Line subway, the Gold Line light rail, and numerous Metro and DASH buses.The hotel's location and its height are its best assets in my view. Asking for a high floor, I was given a 10th floor room, which had an unobstructed view facing south (other directions taller buildings might have blocked it).The room was acceptable, arguably Japanese abstract art on the walls. The bed was comfortable enough and there was good natural light in the daytime and darkness at night. I didn't have any noise problems. There was a decent radio--something you don't always get.As people said the bathroom is small--particularly annoying was a short bathtub with what felt like a sharp edge at the back when I tried to stretch out in it. The bathtub seemed chintzy next to a fairly generous room. Hotels should have adequate length bathtubs or none at all.I didn't try the hotel's restaurants--I went to Weller Court--a 3 story shopping court with multiple restaurants which was literally the next building over. The garden didn't really send me, but I can see where some people would like it.I might stay here again or I might go elsewhere in Downtown LA if I could get a deal, even if those areas are less lively."
"Review_11540","hotel_125","hotel_6921","Nov 27, 2008","nickel and dime The hotel itself was Nice. The room was ok. Upon entering you got the slight smell of mustiness, the carpet had small snags in it, and there were no RCA connections on the TV to hook up a DVD player. There were 2 bottles of water on the table with a $5 price tag on each which would be billed to your room if you drank them which I thought was a joke! The Shower was missing some Caulking around the tub and I think they stopped making that pink shower tile back in the 80鈥檚. The electronic keys I had for the room only worked after trying each of them numerous times. Paying $9.95 for internet service per day was ridiculous when you can get it free at all Starbucks and Best Westerns. And the daily self Parking fee of $24 dollars was a joke, even though it is quoted at $22 in the black guest book in the room. And to top everything off upon checking out I assumed the price I was quoted and booked online included all fees, but I was informed it did not include the daily $13 hotel tax which I had to pay. It seems that this hotel is more worried about getting you in the door at a reasonable room rate so they can nickel and dime you into getting a second job not unlike Home depot. In my opinion if they took as much time paying attention to there guests as they do charging you for any and everything, this hotel would be a nicer place to stay. Not a sermon just a thought."

They refused to honor our reservations, claiming the hotel was oversold. Instead they sent us to the Wilshire Hotel which would not have been our choice. As a result we do not have a good opinion of the Hotel, and cannot comment on the accommodations because there were none.

We took a shuttle bus to the hotel from LAX and it cost us $US15 each - very reasonable. When we arrived the front desk staff checked us in very quickly and couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Every time we passed the desk on the way in or out we were always greeted with a smile and a hello. Our room was very nice. We were on the 12th floor, overlooking the Federal Building looking towards the mountains, with a kingsize bed and beautiful towels. Our room was spotlessly clean and very quiet. When we first arrived in our room, we found the airconditioner was a little noisy, so we rang the front desk and asked if someone could look at it. Within minutes two very friendly maintenance men came and repaired the problem - fabulous service and problem solved. The location of the Kyoto (Downtown) is within walking distance of places like El Pueblo, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and Union Station. Transport is very close by if you need to go by bus or train. The gardens in the hotel are beautiful. Breakfast is not included in the price. We would recommend the Kyoto to friends and would stay there if we were to visit LA again."

We only stayed one night, but have to say that it was a very pleasant stay.We arrived and were very promptly and professionally greeted. We were also given ome lovely iced green tea as a refreshment as we checked in. We had just come up on the train and were not looking our best - we were dressed VERY casually and I was carrying a large backpack - so we almost looked like a couple of drifters, but we were greeted like honored guests just the same. Bravo!The room was small - yet comfortable and clean. What more can you ask for? The bathroom was very clean - this is one of our most important points as no one likes a nasty bathroom.We walked through the hotel - the gardens are lovely - and it is quite impressive that they have such a lush garden spot on the top of a portion of the hotel. We ate at the Thousand Cranes restaurant - this is a top notch Japanese restaurant. We sat at the sushi bar and had a superb eating experience.The Little Tokyo neighborhood is very nice. The area is clean and we were told it has been recently cleaned up and is an up and coming area. There are tons of neat little restaurant in the area and it is also an easy walk to the new home of the LA Philharmonic! Overall this was a great place to stay in Downtown LA - walking distance from the train station and walking distance to great food and events. It couldn't be easier!"

And meters only run until 6PM which is good enough when you come back from dinner or whatever you were doing.The room was comfortable but not as modern as advertised.

The New Otani had been a solid 3-Star hotel, but I had high expectations for this visit, perhaps because of the new name (Kyoto Grand Hotel). Maybe because of those high expectations, I was quite disappointed. The hotel lobby is not spectacular, but very nice. Our room, however, was at a 2-Star level. There were numerous stains on the carpet, and the bathroom, in particular, was quite rundown. Of course, it's all about price/value. In that regard, I feel that it was a good deal, based on the $127/night price I got through Orbitz. I would be very disappointed ath the regular price of $190 to $200/night."

The room was rather cramped with 2 double beds, and the walls were thin. The worst part was that because of its downtown location, there were many helicopters flying around that made it hard for me to sleep. The tea garden sounds nice, but in reality is rather small and not exactly a long romantic stroll.Not much in the area, and so like much of LA, you'll need a car to get around.

At registration the desk clerk handed me a cup of iced tea and a warm towel while I was signing in--a nice touch, and a sign of the thoughtful service that was to mark my stay throughout.The lobby's great, and the third-floor garden is a haven. The restaurant A Thousand Cranes is worth checking out. It's pricey, but the Sunday buffet is one of the best meals (and high-end bargains!) I've had in Los Angeles.The location, with a bail bond place practically next door, may be off-putting, but that's because a city detention center is nearby, as is City Hall. Thanks to one or two restaurants open as late as 3 a.m. I've wandered the streets in the area late at night without incident for more than 25 years. If you use public transit, there are many bus lines that go past it.

I looked for a hotel near the Metro station and Art Museum I was attending within walking distance. This place was a gem. Three blocks from the Metro station and two blocks from the Japanese American National Museum, right in the heart of LA's Little Tokyo. Formerly the New Otani Hotel, (It still has an Asian/Japanese theme) they have about a 20 story tower complete with everything you need. A lobby bar which also serves food, the weekend bartender Roberto G. makes the best mojito you could ever have and also is so personable he shold have a tv show.. Also a lobby level restaurant (Azealia) for mainly american food. A couple floors up are the main eateries, a fine food venue with a sushi and shashimi area, a place with a lot of beef and asian inspired influences and a mainly nighttime bar with every drink you want, including every type of sake, as well as food items. Hours vary depending on the day but there's always something, including room service if it's that late. Plus you're in the heart of little Tokyo. Yeah it might not feel great at 10 or 11 at night but it's safe! And there's a ton of other places to eat as well as the in-house Starbuck's, but they close early.For the hotel itself, easy and quick check-in and out, very competent staff, I never had a problem go unanswered. The room, I had a basic room, was everything you could expect, windows that open, variable A/C, bathroom toiletries, the tv even includes a few HBO channels.My favorite feature was the authentic Japanese Garden, located on a terrace on the third floor, it is a several acre oasis garden of foliage, streams and a waterfall. In one corner there is a full bar and grill where you can walk-up or order food to your table. Grilled ribs and a cool drink while admiring the LA skyline in the middle of a Japanese Garden, how cool!The hotel's staff was always there, not only for security but to make sure you had no problems. I never had one."

There was a large group (25+) of 18-21 year olds staying there on Saturday night who were extremely rude and beligerant; I felt unsafe with them around, but the staff seemed unconcerned about the profanity there were loudly speaking throughout the lobby and garage. I was traveling with my 15 y.o. niece on a road trip from San Jose area, and we ended up leaving a day early even though I had prepaid for the night.

I have not been a frequent visitor to LA, so I was surprised how uninteresting and deserted the downtown area is at night. There seemed to be very little in the immediate vicinity, though Little Tokyo is a few blocks walk away.The hotel itself, as you can guess from its name, has a Japanese theme, but my room showed no such influences. It was a standard, Western-style King-bed room. The amenities were OK, but the overall impression is bland and predictable. A few minor complaints - some of the lamps were not working and neither were the pay-per-view movies. The latter didn't bother me but the problems suggest that routine quality checks are not carried out.I didn't use room service or the in-house restaurants. There is a cocktail and sake bar called Genji, a sushi and tempura bar and a steak/seafood restaurant. They looked expensive and if Japanese food is your thing I suspect you can find a lot better and cheaper within a few blocks of the hotel.If you are staying here and don't have a car, try Pete's Cafe and Bar - about three blocks away and a great place."

It did overlook the gorgeous rooftop gardens. The location is close to the Disney concert hall, but be mindful that unlike many other large cities, there is not much happening in downtown Los Angeles after dark or on the weekends. If you are looking for family -friendly fast food places and activities, you'll have to drive a ways. That was not and issue for us, as you have to drive everywhere in LA anyways! The free parking (with unlimited in and out priveledges) was a real bonus! The restaurants in the hotel were extremely expensive and there did not seem to be too many kid's options, again, there was a Japanese theme to most of them. There is a Starbucks downstairs so that was our breakfast option. The beds and pillows were a little hard, but the toiletries were first rate, with a lovely mandarin orange scent.All in all, for a weekend getaway, it was a good deal for a nice hotel, if you don't mind driving to wherever you have to go."

The hotel has clearly improved. I didn't have any significant problems with it before, but it's clear that the rooms and the lobby have been renovated, and they have stayed faithful to the Japanese decor that makes the hotel and the area so unique. Don't be afraid to walk outside the hotel and around Little Tokyo. It's a nice little area with some good Japanese restaurants. In the room, the view was nice, and the Japanese sliding screens on the windows were a nice touch. Also, it's nice to have the mini-fridge. The bathroom was very clean, but still needs some updating. The tile around the bath tub is a gaudy pink color, and although I liked the handheld shower head, it wouldn't stay in the right position when I put it on the hook. The faucet at the sink was difficult to operate and get a good temperature. I will also insert my usual complaint about extra fees, including $24 for self-parking. However, overall, the hotel was a great place to stay, and another great deal ($80 winning bid on Priceline)."

We got a great deal online ($99) and were surprised to find that the price included parking (normally $24). Our room was a nice size, clean, and our favorite part was the Japanese screens on the windows. We had a great view of the garden and downtown LA. Our bed was not extremely comfortable, but not awful either. The gardens were beautiful."
"Review_11571","hotel_125","hotel_1260","May 18, 2008","What an Experience This review is a bit belated. We stayed one Saturday night at the Kyoto using a $79 internet rate which included free self-parking. It was our first visit to Los Angeles in over a decade and I really wish we were able to stay longer. At check in we were upgraded to a suite. We were given the choice between an American style or Japanese style. We chose a Japanese style suite that had a view of the roof garden (just lovely!). The room had a pretty traditional living room with a sofa and t.v., 1 1/2 bath (complete with a jacuzzi tub and Japanese foot bath), a balcony with small table and chairs, and a bedroom/dining room complete with tatami mats and Japanese sliding screens. During the day, the bedroom is to be used as a dining room which has a low lying table with cushions and armrests around it. We would have liked to have had dinner using room service in that setting, but we had scheduled a turn down that would have interrupted our dinner. Upon check in, we scheduled a turn down which consisted of housekeeping pushing aside our dining table and chairs and replacing it with a futon and blankets. We checked in after a day at the convention center, we were worn out, hungry, and a bit disheveled. We quickly went down to the restaurant floor in search of some dinner. We perused the menus quickly learning that we couldn't afford to eat at the hotel. The restaurants seemed rather upscale and the entrees appeared very pricey. We were there on a $79 rate after all. So it was time to venture out into the neighborhood. The neighborhood was filled with curry houses, bakeries, gift shops, and sushi joints. We found a market that had bento boxes and specialty items in a shopping area connected to one side of the hotel. We settled on an inexpensive sushi/bento joint and then wandered over to the infamous pnkberry which we brought back to our room to enjoy. As the evening became darker, a few beggars did start to come out, but overall the neighborhood was very well populated with groups of people hanging out and eating out.We may have just been extremely tired, but we had no problem with noise. We had a great night sleeping on a futon (who would have guessed). We woke up early the next morning and checked out around 7 am. We had a fantastic stay and would love the opportunity to do it again. The room was well appointed, beautiful, and very clean. One note about parking: the self parking garage was crazy! The hotel seemed at pretty high capacity that night-touring groups, a wedding, regular guests, etc. There were no more parking slots available so they had attendants who would park your car for you once you reached the bottom level of the structure. They handed you a ticket and took over the driving. They were parking cars anywhere there was space. Since it isn't valet, there isn't a valet stand or an organized way to get your keys and car back. Luckily, we found a parking attendant on his break who was very helpful and ran all over to find our car for us. In about 10 minutes or so, we were on our way."

I realize that downtown LA is not a hotspot by any means..that being said, we stayed on a Saturday for a friend's wedding and of the four places to eat in the hotel, only one was open and the menu was not very exciting. My noodle bowl was delicious but everything else was below average. Imagine my shock when for three people, the bill came to $100. That seems a bit pricey for two noodle bowls and a hamburger and some fries. We decided to get a drink before the wedding, but the bar wasn't open in the hotel until well into the evening. The rooms were average size, but the bathroom needed some upgrading. All the tiles in the shower were cracked / broken. This wasn't the worst hotel I stayed in but I wouldn't recommend it either."

We locked ourselves out of the room safe and they came within 30 minutes to help us out.The business center has free internet but only for 5 minutes. No problem, we went in a few times :) There is also a hotspot at the attached Starbucks (you have to go from outside)The area looked pretty safe though we didn't venture out much at night.

"Review_11578","hotel_125","hotel_9889","Mar 19, 2008","Good Value Was there one night with my son. Good value for the money. The lobby and personal service staff were better than expected. Prompt and professional valet, bell service, etc. Very clean and updated in common areas. Our room was a little dated, with older tub tile and some evidence of deferred maintenance. At the time of our booking they had an internet special which made it very well worth the money, but still at rack rates this is a safe and good place to stay. Access via expressways is easy and we even saw a movie being filmed on the street a few blocks from the hotel. I had read about street noise, which I did notice from the 16th floor, but what do you expect in downtown LA?"
"Review_11579","hotel_125","hotel_9631","Mar 2, 2008","Nice hotel but nothing special Although I cannot complain really as the hotel was booked as part of a prize package I won in the UK, I feel that some points are quite valid.The hotel is in downtown LA mainly in Chinatown and the business area. It is about 10 miles away from the touristy areas. I asked one of the staff where we should go to eat locally and he could not advise but did say to keep away from the missionary area which is not too far away from the hotel.I found that a car with a sat nav is a must to get around as I would have found it quite difficult to get around. Those of a nervous disposition on motorways should stay clear of the freeways as it is bedlam!As for the hotel, it is classified as a 3.5 star. I would give it a 3 star rating as I would have expected more from an american hotel. It primarily caters for Japanese tourists and business people.It is clean but was quite dated, the room was also fairly small. I would recommend you take some filter coffee and milk with you as we were only supplied one one sachet of coffee aday. Although when asked they did supply another one!We did not eat in any of the a la carte restaurants as it seemed fairly expensive. Instead opting for the restaurant on the ground floor where the food was adequate but still quite expensive."

There are so many condos, stores, and restaurans, so I can say it was safe area! For dinning, I tried a restaurant in the hotel AZALEA, their salad was really good, and they have healthy menu as well. My friend ate Lunch Buffet, it seemed nice, too. At night time, I went up to Garden Level, there was beautiful garden over there. I wish I could eat at Japanese restaurant in front of the garden next time. it will be nice view from the restaurant.Anyway, I had a good time at this hotel. The room was clean, staff was nice and friendly, they had fitness, museums are close... I think the hotel will be nice for most of people."

We are from Sweden and made a road trip and were about to spend the last couple of days of our trip here. We stayed at the hotel for five nights and we had some splendid days. Although we weren't at the hotel so often, we had an awesome time when we were there. The fruit and water table by the pool made our sunbathing experience much more luxe! Fantastic! The location was great, easy to find, just by the freeway. We didn't hear anything of the traffick to our room! The room was really modern and stylish! The aircondition was great! We want to give credit to the cleaning personnell who always cleaned our room so nicely!! It was a friendly gesture that they came to the rooms in the afternoon to ask wheather we wanted new towels. Have to recommend this hotel to everyone!"
"Review_11586","hotel_126","hotel_4219","Aug 22, 2008","Contemporary Classic I had a very enjoyable stay at the Luxe on Sunset. The staff know what they are doing, the rooms are large, the beds are extremely comfortable (never slept as well in a hotel), the pool is just large enough to do laps, the bathroom was pretty much as big as any I've seen in most 5 star hotels, and the decor is comtemporary classic, with earth tones and strong square shapes. The restaurant is good, but not excellent. I tend to judge on the classic caesar salad with chicken. The chicken was over cooked/dry. The service at the spa is very professional, and welcoming. The pool is salt water, which is becoming the norm. The conceirge was able to let me know about a local but competing restaurant for breakfast, which I did enjoy. I also sat in the bar one night for dinner, and the bartender was excellent.There was only on issue, which was the band that I've been told plays Tuesday and Thursday. I could clearly hear them in my room, and I was a distance from them. Luckily they only played until 10:30 PM. They were good, but it was distracting that I could hear them in my room. Also I could hear every word in the hall (they might want to consider sound proof doors). I would not recommend this hotel to light sleepers (this isn't one of my issues."
"Review_11587","hotel_126","hotel_3940","Aug 17, 2008","Luv the Luxe A sparkling gem of an oasis. The setting and location are perfect. The two hotel buildings are seperated by a hilly incline which is an easy walk or drive up the hill with the sparkling and beautifully appointed pool on the upper level. A few rooms overlook the freeway, but most overlook the pool and gorgeous surroundings. The room was very large, quiet, and extremely well appointed. The decor and furniture are definitely not IKEA, like some of the other reviewers seemed to think. The staff, valets, and waiters treated us superbly-with prices in line with any major US city-valet included at $21/day. The Luxe is far superior to most hotels in this price range anywhere. We arrived before check in and they allowed us to change in the gym and relax at the pool while waiting. Lunch was excellent and can be delivered poolside."
"Review_11588","hotel_126","hotel_3128","Aug 10, 2008","Treated like second class citizen I purchased a two night stay at the Luxe through Sky Auction for my wife's birthday. We checked out after the first night. I booked a king size room. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that no rooms were available at the time we arrive approximately 12 noon. however we were told to come back later and we would be taken care of. We returned about 6 pm and was assigned a room. We entered the large room that was pleasantly decorated. However it had two standard size beds. Both my wife and I have leg problems and it makes in nearly impossible to sleep in a standard size bed. When I called the front desk, I was told that I would be called back in 15 minutes with a resolution. After about 30 minutes I was called to be told there were no other rooms available and there wasn't anything we could do. I called housekeeping to get a few extra pillows to help brace our legs and was told they would be right up. After 30 minutes we called the front desk and their response was that we would be called in 10 minutes with the location of our requested pillows. 30 minutes pasted and no pillows arrived. We called the front desk again and a few minutes later pillows arrived. Unfortunately the pillows had wet pillow cases. My wife took the pillows to the front desk and asked if the clerk would like to sleep with wet pillows. About 20 minutes later new pillows with dry cases arrived about 90 minutes after the first request. The room had one robe in the closet (the robe was shabby with the lining all torn) we asked the representative how delivered the pillow if we could have a second robe and the response was no only suites can have two robes and if we wanted one we would need to call the front desk.The next morning after a very restless night of sleep we checked out. The clerk at the desk hardly acknowledged are presence and never asked why were checking out early or if we had a pleasant stay.I would urge people to avoid the Luxe."
"Review_11589","hotel_126","hotel_6078","Jul 21, 2008","The steepest hill in hotels! I last stayed in the Luxe in 2004 when I had a pleasant few days. After reading some reviews on this site, I was concerned that the place had gone downhill, however I took the chance as I wanted somewhere with a balcony (to smoke) along with a restaurant and bar.I shouldn't have worried. Unfortunately it seems that people are more likely to write a review after a negative stay - I feel that positive stays deserve a review also!Let's start with Customer Service. I could not fault it at all. Unfortunately (through no fault of the hotel, they got the wrong booking information) I was put into a standard room rather than the Jr Exec Suite that I booked. I mentioned this at the front desk and spoke to the desk manager to apologised profusely for the issue but mentioned that they were fully booked that evening. He promised to sort it the next day. It was sorted the next day without bother. I went out and when I returned I had a new room with all my cases moved over. The suite was great. Extremely spacious with additional seating, huge bed and desk to work upon. The bathroom was also large with a sunken bath and a shower that could take at least four in comfort if you are so inclined (I did want to try it out but couldn't find another three people to join me :)Unfortunately my AC stopped working on the first night in my new room, just as a wedding started outside my window. I had to open the window to get some air into the room but just as the wedding music was making me stir crazy, the maintainance man fixed my AC - again, great service - fixed within 30 mins.As for food, it is quite expensive (well for the US anyway), but it was okay. Some dishes were great, others less so but the guys in the restaurant were incredibly friendly and polite. Likewise all the staff!Parking is a pain. Valet parking is compulsory at $25 or so per day, but again the valet team were incredibly quick and efficient - less than five minutes to get the car from turning up at the front desk.So what was bad? Nothing really, only a few really picky grumbles. Firstly whilst their website and the general hotel sites such as travelocity and hotels.com state they have smoking rooms, all rooms are non smoking. Not a problem if you get a room with a patio or balcony, but I had neither. Mind you, the 20 yard walk outside was far better than the 10 minute hikes I have had in previous hotels!Another problem was with the events. Rooms in the lower complete that are odd will tend to overlook the party area. Not a problem if you don't go to bed until later as they tended to be over by 10:30, but for early sleepers it can get quite noisy.The hotel is also split with the lower complex with restaurant and event areas, and the upper area with spa and pool. Rooms are at both locations but they are split by the steepest hotel hill in the world. Seriously, this baby must by 1:4 and 30-40 yards long! You can get a ride up to the top, but having to tip someone just to get to your room can be frustrating.The location is a little out of the way however (given good LA traffic) you can get to Santa Monica, Hollywood etc.. in a few mins. The place is right on the corner of Sunset and 405 so you can get anywhere easily - just don't try it in the morning and always take the garage exit to get to the highway!So all in all, a very pleasant stay and I will definitely be back if only to enjoy the excellent, polite and friendly staff that the Luxe employs - thanks to you all!"

We had a wonderful and great stay. The staff was nice and helpful. Our room was large by all means and we got everything we asked for. Even when we considered switching to a (more expensive) room by the pool, they did not hesitate for a second and showed and offered us the rooms without extra charge. I stayed at numerous hotels in LA and the LUXE was one of the best ones I stayed at. You definitely get a very good price/value ratio. I will definitely stay there again. I might also try out the one on Rodeo. For families I recommend to get a room by the pool, all others stay in the main part."

The location is ideal, being on Sunset Boulevard, but we hadn't taken into account that it was directly overlooking the Freeway. It didn't bother us at all in fact, as we were in the rooms at the top of the hotel, the spa section, so it was reasonably quiet. The rooms are clean and spacious. I would suggest the pool side rooms with a balcony, as the quietest and prettiest views.The staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the excellent service and good food in the restaurant at breakfast and one evening when we dined in. The pool is great and our sons spent most of our stay in it. The valets were very obliging about taking us up the hill in their golf buggies, if the courtesy bus wasn't there.Overall, a happy experience in a friendly, well run hotel."
"Review_11595","hotel_126","hotel_9045","Apr 13, 2008","Mixed Bag at the Luxe We recently spent six nights at the Luxe, located off Sunset Blvd. and the 405 Freeway. As we frequently travel with our small dog on business we were pleased at their open dog policy and had no complaints about how we were treated. We booked a Junior Suite (a large room with a seating area - no doors in between). The room was comfortable and had an open sliding door to a grassy area outside - perfect for walking the dog and relaxing outdoors. Rooms and grounds appear well maintained. Service was enthusiastic and very polite, but somewhat spotty - our bags took about an hour to arrive from the main lobby. Wireless internet - there is no wired internet - is spotty and cannot totally be relied upon.There are two main problems with the hotel. The first is that it is located up a steep hill right off of Sunset Blvd. This means that joggers and dog-walkers will have a hard time. We drove about a half mile to a less trafficked area for exercise. The second problem is that the hotel is on two separate levels, separated by quite a bit of steep hill. The main lobby and some rooms are located in the lower level. Another set of rooms, including ours, and the spa are located at an upper level. The only connection between levels is walking up and down the hill on a road, waiting for a sporadic hotel shuttle ride or driving up and down and having the valets handle your car. As we had a lot of business to do at the lower level - we were interviewing prospective staff in the hotel bar and restaurant areas - we found this very inconvenient. On the positive side, location is excellent for driving. The hotel is one minute from the 405 freeway and quite near some excellent parks - including the little known but lovely Will Rogers State Park.We would return to this hotel again, if we could make sure we were given a room on the lower level"

Having read the rather mixed reviews here I was a little anxious, however, I was pleasantly surprised by both the hotel and the service. The room was extremely spacious and spotlessly clean.

The pool area was also very nice.I found that all staff (valets, front-desk staff, housekeeping, room service) were friendly and efficient. I never had to wait long for my car to be brought round and the valets recommended me some great routes to drive in the hills above LA. Housekeeping staff were also very good and my room appeared to be cleaned about 3 times a day.I did not eat at the hotel restaurant, however, I did order room service for breakfast and snacks. I found the food to be of a decent quality, good portions and also reasonably priced.Personally, I thought the location of the hotel was v convenient - particularly with the 405 freeway being so close-by.

"Review_11597","hotel_126","hotel_5556","Mar 30, 2008","The Luxe is great The Luxe on Sunset is a great hotel - the staff is friendly and helpful and the location is excellent. The rooms were large, a little sparsely furnished but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom large. We received a coupon for a complimentary glass of wine our first night which was appreciated. The food, as it is at most hotels was only okay and overpriced. Skip the toast and coffee breakfast for 12 bucks and walk the 10 minutes to Barrington Ave in Brentwood - a lovely walk along Sunset with beautiful houses to look at and have breakfast at one of the 2 bakeries or Starbucks - for a lot less money. The hotel offers a shuttle service, but to a very limited area - Brentwood, which is a very easy walk, the UCLA area and the Getty Center. The Luxe has a sister hotel on Rodeo drive and since most people want to go to that area, it would be nice if the shuttle ran between the hotels, but it does not - and it is only about a mile out of their three mile radius the shuttle travels. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would gladly stay there again.Kim from Indianapolis"

As I first walked down the dark hallways, the light fixtures were full of dead bugs!I complained and was offered to change rooms. After looking at the alternative, I chose to stay in my current room because I did not want to listen to the freeway noise all night. I asked for a housekeeper to come by. I explained the problems (fortunately I speed some Spanish) and tipped her in advance. After shopping I returned with some spot remover and applied it to the carpets, and most of the spots came out.

We spent some time in the sauna, right outside the spa and across from our sliding glass doors. The bathroom is huge, separate shower, and tub has jacuzzi jets. The jacuzzi tub was the highlight of our stay, simply awesome. Since we live nearby and just wanted to relax, we had dinner at the hotel, which was of course pricey but not more than what is expected. Room service was efficient and friendly.

"Review_11605","hotel_127","hotel_2319","Dec 18, 2008","LOVED The Millennium Biltmore! My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 days before heading off to Las Vegas. Was a little worried about staying at the hotel after reading some of the negative reviews, however I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. The hotel is amazing with a very grand feel. On other reviews people have said its old fashioned but I would say its more old style Hollywood glamour. It doesn't feel dated at all, gorgeous decor and the first floor reception and lobby are beautiful. I was shocked when we got to our room...it was HUGE and really lovely. It felt like a suite with a living area etc and a really big wardrobe. The bathroom was quite small but nice and clean. The hotel room had everything we needed, clean comfy beds, lots of info on LA, plenty of space and a big TV with lots of channels. I'm not sure if all the rooms at this hotel are the same but our room was massive.We ate at the Japanese restaurant on our first night as we was too tired to leave the building. Glad we did as it was delicious, really modern, quite pricy but definatly worth the money. Every member of staff at this hotel was lovely and helpful. Reception were extremely accommodating and couldn't do enough for you. The guy at the concierge was really helpful too. He helped us book loads of great things to do... tours etc and helped us save money whilst doing so..he also recommended good places to eat, and all that we tried were brilliant. We did a great tour of LA seeing the Hollywood houses, Chinese Theatre, Venice Beach, Santa Monica Pier, Rodeo Drive etc. Was Fab and we got to see so much of LA that on our other days we could then go back to the places we enjoyed the most. Venice beach is really nice, and has a cool vibe to the place. I love shopping and found the best shops on Melrose avenue, the shops are different and unique there and a lot cheaper than Rodeo Drive or Robertson Drive! We didn't hire a car but buses and trains are very cheap!We didn't pay a lot to stay at this hotel at all and it definatly exceeded our expectations. It is a very high standard hotel in a good location where u can feel safe at night too. I will definatly stay at this hotel again, I LOVED it!!"

The room was small but tastefully decorated and well equipped. Like many older hotels, noise from the hallway travels easily so ask for a room away from the elevators and other busy corridors. The staff was friendly and helpful but I did have a couple of problems. I had trouble getting the internet to work($10/day) and had to leave a message for the hotel's IT person who was eventually able to help. I also had $90 of international phone calls on my bill even though I didn't make any calls. Although the front desk took the phone charges off the bill when I checked out, my credit card was charged anyway. I eventually got everything straightened out, but it was a hassle. The nearby Water Grill serves incredible seafood, but expect to pay. Lunch averaged $60/person without alcohol."
"Review_11607","hotel_127","hotel_5304","Nov 29, 2008","Beautiful but... Astoundingly beautiful hotel in a mundane, rather drab part of the city. If you can get a deal on a room, take it, but don't order room service or drink at the residents bar, you'll end up re-mortgaging your house. Explore the area to find better, cheaper eating/drinking options. There's a lively Irish pub down the street.My main problem was having to pay $10 a day for what was grossly substandard internet access. They call it High Speed but it resembled high speed in 1995. Truly dreadful but don't bother complaining, the receptionist will give you that blank look.To sum up, great to sleep in (beds are deliciously comfortable) but check out the locale, it's cheaper outside the hotel. Staff were friendly if not a little detached."
"Review_11608","hotel_127","hotel_7357","Nov 23, 2008","Like a Fabulous trip back in time I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Biltmore and am almost tempted to give 5 stars, except for a few little niggles.To begin with the good - the ground floors are absolutely gorgeous with a great deal of restored original architecture/decor from the 1920's. My room was only a standard but quite spacious with a very comfortable bed, desk, full closet and comfy chair. My room was on the inside of the building, overlooking a quiet courtyard and I heard virtually no outside noise thanks to the white noise generated by the heat/AC. And the water pressure in the shower was fantastic. The workout equipment in the health club facilities were a little squished and I think I used the oldest still-working elliptical machine in North America. But the treadmills are all pretty new and most machines have a personal flat screen. However, that was completely made up for by the rest of the facilities - the pool, jacuzzi, sauna and spa look original and made me feel like some robber baron in the gilded age.The location is excellent for business in or near downtown and is right in the heart of the financial district. It could also be a good choice for tourists because it is so close to the 101, 110, 5 and 10 freeways, so you can pretty much get anywhere.Now for the bad things - all of which are relatively minor and would not stop me from booking here again. First, like many hotels, they charge for internet access, which I find a highly offensive practice. Also, valet is $40/night. This is not unusual in LA, but should be factored into your budget. The tub/shower had a curtain, rather than a door, which kept sticking to me because it didn't have magnets in the bottom. This was particularly gross since the housekeeping seemed hit or miss - I had 3 great days and 2 eh days. The TV in my room was an old, small CRT type and many of the channels buzzed or otherwise had bad reception. Finally, when I ordered room service breakfast, my receipt had the wrong name and room number on it. When I asked, the staff person told me You must have written the wrong number on your ticket, this is for you. That was completely unacceptable at this level hotel. Even if I actually had made the mistake, I should have received the customer is always right treatment. But, like I said, I would definitely stay here again, it's a great hotel."
"Review_11609","hotel_127","hotel_5217","Nov 17, 2008","Only if you need to be downtown and aren't hiring a car The front counter staff are extremely professional, but far from polite if you have an issue that's out of the ordinary. The concierge is impossible to get a hold of. Don't hire a car if your staying here, parking is $40 USD per night plus valet tips are expected.The hotel itself is well presented and clean. Don't expect a fridge let alone a mini-bar. The lower level staff (cleaners, chefs) barely speak english so be sure to be clear when giving instructions.Unless you have business in DOWNTOWN Los Angeles, this is not there place to stay. Most tourist spots are north-west of downtown (with the exception of Disneyland).Only stay here if you've won a prize or don't plan to leave your hotel room for the entire stay."

As long as you can keep in mind that it is an older property you will be pleased. The bedding was fabulous and the service I received was as well. They could use some new carpets and some cosmetics but other than that I would recommend staying there. My cell phone worked great (I saw another person had a problem)."

The guest rooms vary widely: mine had an extra 150 sq. ft. of space which was devoid of furniture while other rooms felt cramped, both the result of a quirky building. Furnishings are elegant -- some might feel out of place in such surroundings. Maintenance is decent but imperfect -- expect some slight problem with the room. Some rooms face an ugly inside courtyard, but with the pretty wooden shutters, one hardly notices (even so, consider asking for an outside room). Some minor service issues, but nothing unexpected given the size of the hotel.The hotel does significant business with the consolidator AlliedTPro; if you're willing to prepay for your room, cheap rates can often be found on no-name booking sites, particularly those geared to European travelers. kayak.com was successful at finding several of those for me.Parking at the hotel is far, far more expensive than other lots nearby. Park somewhere else."
"Review_11612","hotel_127","hotel_9174","Oct 14, 2008","Lots of Hollywood History here I stayed here for three nights in July while attending a meeting at the hotel. This a huge, grand, old place with an incredible history. If you go, take a look at all the photos of early Academy Award ceremonies that were held at the hotel. It's amazing. Anyway, the hotel itself is fine. The rooms are pretty basic - not too big and not too small with all the usual amenities. The bathrooms seem very outdated, though. The staff was pleasant and professional - this is a Millenium Hotel. The health club in the basement is adequate. The Japanese restaurant on-site was good, but INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. I think it was $180 for two of us and we each only had one drink, appetizers, and entrees!! The hotel is located in a business district, so the area gets quiet after 5:00. However, there are lots of great breakfast and lunch places (a wonderful diner around the corner) in the area. The Metro station is a block away and you can be in Hollywood in 20 minutes. I did like the hotel. With the craziness of LA, I thought it was a pleasant, quiet place to come back to at the end of the day/evening."

"Review_11614","hotel_127","hotel_3686","Sep 27, 2008","Good experience We stayed just one night at the Millennium Biltmore in LA mainly with a view to getting a good night's sleep after the 10 hour flight from London. And it proved just that. Very comfortable rooms, with excellent beds, clean bathrooms and a general airy and spacious feel throughout the hotel. The location is very business oriented and I'd probably choose to stay in a more Venice/Santa Monica area for leisure next time, but I'd defintely have no problem staying at the Biltmore again."

This was a beautiful hotel, the decor and ambiance was exactly what we were hoping for. The pool and hot tub area was amazing, although we had hardly any time to relax we were so busy touring LA. The staff was friendly and helpful. We also ran into some late night filming of CSI right outside the hotel which was a great experience."

I definitely believe I got my moneys worth. Again the staff were always helpful. I especially liked the bar for a chill out drink - the music was always very cool and the bartender was great!

"Review_11618","hotel_127","hotel_3743","Sep 10, 2008","Poor Customer Service (including General Manager) Simply put---the hotel lobby was nice, but the customer service was poor and I would not recomend staying here. I am an attorney and a frequent business traveler. I booked online with a friends card who wanted to pay for my hotel. When I arrived I was asked for a card for incidentals and I provided my personal card. At check out my personal card was charged and I was advised that the hotel could not charge the card that was provided during online booking. I spoke with Vincent Piro, the General Manager, and was not helpful. He explained that he has been in the hotel industry for years and they have never done that. I explained that I travel often and have never been challenged in this way. I advised him that I would not stay in this hotel again and would not recomend it to others.Further, my internet connection did not work during my entire stay. I need to work and had to leave my room and go to a Starbucks in order to work.Though cheap, this hotel is not worth the money. Please think twice before booking with them."

This hotel had a really nice look to the lobby and other various rooms, although the guest rooms are very dusty and old fashioned and i dont mean the style i just mean they need modernising......ALOT! The tv looked like the oldest model iv ever seen in a hotel and the hotel itself believes its a luxury one!!! Iv never seen such old electrical appliances. Staff were friendly and it has a nice historical feel, i think thats why it gets away with being a so called luxury hotel. Its very expensive, no mini bar in the room, bathroom was tiny! I had stayed in palm springs for 3 nights before arriving here and payed $100 per night for a 5 star real luxuruy hotel and there is such a big difference in the quality of the hotels. Parking is $40 per day which is nearly more than a room itself!!! The location is good if you want to be down town LA but its far from hollywood and santa monica. If id known then what i know now there is no way id stay there and its due to overpriced parking and interenet and last but not least the location. I would much rather be on the beach or a more relaxed area."

Really dissappointed with room, very small, dark and somewhat depressing. The bathroom was incredibly small and both the sink and bath tub had large cracks and dirt in them.The location wasn't great, apart from access to public transport. The hotel is in the financial district so is very quiet at night. There were alot of dodgy people hanging around the Metro station and when we wondered down to the fashion and jewellery districts a police officer advised it wasn't an area for tourists and suggested we leave immediately!We ventured over to West Hollywood, which is a much nicer (and safer) area.Did eat in the Sushi restuarant within the hotel which was nice - but expensive."

"Review_11624","hotel_127","hotel_4690","Aug 15, 2008","Elegant, old-time, historic beautifully restored The Biltmore is an elegant, beautifully restored old-time hotel. Service was excellent throughout from the valets, to bell captain, front desk, room service ... everyone was accomodating and eager to please. The gorgeous detailing on the ceilings, photos from Academy Awards in years past on the History wall, even the beautiful indoor pool all made my stay a special one. The only small issue that I had with room comfort was that the A/C had to stay on for there to be air circulating and the noise disturbed my sleep. Also the bathroom was rather small. I'm petite myself and my elbow always bumped the toilet paper dispenser; I'm pretty sure a tall person would find the tiny bathrooms impossible."
"Review_11625","hotel_127","hotel_7451","Aug 13, 2008","Disappointing I recently stayed at the Biltmore with family members for a weekand I was disappointed. I booked the reservation 3 months in advance. When we got to the hotel we had to wait several hoursbefore our room was ready. The lobby area is beautiful, but the rooms are another story. The inside of the bathtub was chipped. There was a problem flushing the toilet. The television was old and small. There was a buzzing sound on some of the stations. I understand this is a old hotel but surely some upgrades can be made to the rooms without the hotel losing its historic charm. The pool area was dark and dreary. I never saw anyone there .The gift shop was over priced and some of the staff was not so friendly. I also do not consider this to be a child friendly hotel. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. It's not likely that I would stay here again."

Their standard rooms are massive, clean and quietly elegant! The lobby and all common areas remind one of what you might imagine a Grande Hotel in the old European fashion to be (though really Europe rarely offers such space and elegance at this price!!The staff were friendly and helpful and my overall experience makes me want to return again and again anytime I'm passing through LA!The only draw back is Down Town LA it's self. Outside the hotel most restaurants and activities are non existent after 6pm and Down Town is rather far away from many of the cities tourist venues.

"Review_11628","hotel_127","hotel_6160","Jul 31, 2008","NOt what it seems I stayed at the Millenium Biltmore in Los Angeles for 7 days this past week. I enjoyed my stay in Los Angeles, but the hotel had some problems.First off, when we checked in they lied to us when they told us that they did not have any rooms available because the people don't check out until 2 pm. That was what the front desk girl said. It turns out that they check out at 12pm. She obviously was new, or so I thought. Then when she charged my credit card for the usual incidentals, I asked how much would be held. She stated no more than $300.00, what she failed to mention that in addition there would be an automatic $300.00 tacked on at the end of that same night for a total of $600.00 being held. I asked someone else the next day when I checked my balance and saw that it appeared to be an extra charge, when they told me that it was not extra, that is usual and customary. I felt that it was deceitful. Be up front.Second, the hotel bathroom toilet had problems flushing. The paint was chipping, and the TV was quite small. The area by the pool was so dark and desloate, it was univiting. The exterior of the hotel and the lobby is quite impressive, but it is a rip off.It is convenient to transportation which was our main concern, so that worked out, but food was not cheap in this hotel. It seemed over priced for the ammenities, which were none.I would only stay here if you have to do business in the downtown area."

The reception area is fantastic and the staff very friendly. You just feel that this hotel has a long lasting tradition and a lot of history. But that麓s as well the big problem: they did not upgrade the room facilities to todays traveler麓s expectation. The rooms are pretty old, the bath very old. The rooms are very loud as the windows do provide 0 sound protection. You think that the cars and just driving through your room. You better take some noise protection equipment with you. If the Hotel Management would upgrade the rooms I would go there again, without hesitation. Otherwise I rather suggest one of the many modern hotels around the Biltmore."

Upon arriving in Los Angeles, we had no idea of where to go and what to see. We decided to leave our fate in the hands of the concierge, James Russel. Mr. Russel not only gave us great recommendations and exact directions, he also provided us with the best hospitality around. Once Mr. Russel found out that my husband was in the army and was visiting from Iraq, he sent us a card signed by the hotel staff and basket of fruit to our room.

The front desk people were friendly, courteous, and let us check into our room immediately. The hotel's public areas are, of course, stunning, but I had read some negative comments about the rooms. So we were pleasantly surprised by our spacious, well appointed room. On the third floor, in a standard room, we had a view of Pershing Square. Our total bill for the night including tax and 4 long distance calls was $208. My only complaint was that they charged me $1 each for toll free calls, but I think this is fairly common in some luxury hotels.Anyone who thinks these rooms are small hasn't traveled much outside of the US.

"Review_11633","hotel_127","hotel_3315","Jul 19, 2008","Better than expected! After booking our incredibly reasonably priced reservation on Expedia, I was a little worried to see so many bad reviews here on TripAdvisor. All I can say is that while some of the comments are valid, the good outweighs the bad at the Biltmore.We were 4 people staying in two rooms for 4 nights. While both rooms were the same price, one of them was really spacious with seating area and a large walk in closet, while the other was more or less a standard sized room. The smaller room also had the inconvenience of sharing an entryway with a locked door with another room, so we couldn't just go knock on our companion's door because they wouldn't hear us.The rooms were clean, though obviously not modern, which two of us found charming and two of us weren't as excited by. The beds were great, the linens were nice and the TV was decent sized. My Mom and I used the pool and the jacuzzi which was really something to see, though not the most functional in that the hot tub couldn't seat more than two people. I would agree with travellers who would say that there is nothing around the hotel and this part of the city is pretty dead in the evenings, but as we had other plans most of the time, this wasn't a problem for us. There are only a few restaurants around, but we found one we really enjoyed and went there twice.There are two big downsides we found. The first was the noise. My home is towndown Montreal and even I found it to be a bit noisy at night and in the early morning. Thicker, more soundproof windows would make a great difference. The second was the price of the valet parking at $40 a day. Yes we could have gone to the parking garage around the corner but we were doing a lot of in and out and it just seemed more convenient. But for that price, we would have expected that when we called ahead to have our car brought round we wouldn't have to wait, which was always the case. A small downside was not having ice on every floor, but that was minor. That said, it really is something to be staying in a hotel with such dramatically beautiful public areas and at least average guest areas. We did get our money's worth."

On July 1st I checked in the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown LA. The hotel is very beautiful. A little too classy for me, but hey, that's not the hotel's fault, probably mine and mostly my travel agent's. The room was great and I really loved the bathroom and the shower. Long baths in the bathtub, great right?So, everything was perfect but then, in the last day before I had to leave I decided to go relax a bit in the pool and in the jacuzzi. What a disappointment! The pool area (wich they call the health club because there is also a gym) was awful. Not because is not great itself but it was literally abandoned by the hotel staff. Many towels in the floor, liter, and no life guards (but they do have a big sign saying hey, it's every man (and kid) for himself). But what was most upsetting was the cold jacuzzi that was not working. Not working?. Ok, let me get someone from the staff. Ops, where are they? No one is here. Let me try to find a phone. No, no phone either. Ok, finally a phone behind the bar. Can you please send someone here to see why the jacuzzi is not working. 10 minutes later a guy comes, says nothing (like is everyhing allright? or even good evening sir), turns the machine on and goes away (still not saying a thing). Does the jacuzzi gets any hot? No.Very disappointing. At the same time a weeding reception was happening in the hotel. Maybe they were kind of busy with that, I don't know. I end up forgetting to complain with the hotel, I regret that. Other then that, you should stay there. Not a very expensive hotel and very confortable."

"Review_11638","hotel_127","hotel_7705","Jul 1, 2008","Lovely hotel Myself and my girlfreind stayed at the Biltmore for four nights in June 2008, and were quite impressed by the appearance of the hotel and helpfulness of the staff. The location of the Biltmore is excellent, being just across the road from Pershing Square and its metro station. This means that prime tourist sites, such as Hollywood and Universal Studios are only about 20 minutes away. This was important for us because we didn't have a car to travel around. As for the hotel itself, the exterior but particularly the interior of the lobby is impressive. It strikes you as a quality hotel as soon as you walk through the door. The large pictures on the wall are reminiscent of the closing scene in The Shining; the corridor leading to the health centre has many photographs of the hotel's history- I thought this was a nice touch.The room we had was a little on the small side, but was otherwise fine.The health centre is an excellent amenity, featuring a swimming pool (which closes at 8 pm, which is a little early I thought), and a fitness centre (which remains open 24 hours). We ordered room service our final night, which was promptly delivered and was delicious. It was probably the best room service I've experienced in fact.The only negative I experienced during my stay was the shower in my room, which ceased to work on our final morning in the hotel, which meant I had to use one in the health centre. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. I got a good deal on hotels.com, and for what I payed my stay was excellent. The staff were courteous throughout and the facilities excellent. If I were to re-visit LA I would consider staying at the Biltmore again."
"Review_11639","hotel_127","hotel_8861","Jun 30, 2008","Great property. Could use some improvements. My wife and I stayed four nights here in late June. Prior to our stay, we stayed at the Disneyland Grand Californian property for three days. The Biltmore does not compare to the Grand Californian but it's also not as expensive. Like everybody has already said, the lobby and public spaces are gorgeous (my wife found everything a bit creepy however, as the old black and white photos and the hallways and corridors reminded her too much of The Shining -- she was half-expecting that I would be possessed by evil spirits when I returned to our room from getting some ice!) but the rooms are less than modern. Parking is also a hassle. So, all in all, here is my summary of the Biltmore:Disadvantages:- lots of street noise (bring earplugs!)- old old TV (c'mon, I understand the Biltmore is limited in some respect by the architecture of the building but certainly better and newer TVs cannot possibly be beyond their budget! Many luxury hotels -- including the Disney Grand Californian -- have already switched over to widescreen LCDs)- No mini-fridge. Really, how many luxury hotels can you think of that do not have fridges. Come on, Biltmore folks, they are not that expensive!- The valet parking is a hassle. Expensive ($40 per day) and also time-consuming if you need your car often. I also stopped tipping the valet after the first few times because I realized to tip a fiver everytime you need your car was going to get way too expensive. Like other reviewers have mentioned, there is parking across the street at Pershing Square but there are no in and out privileges and you have to be out of the parking lot before 9 AM or they will charge you more than the overnight flat rate. There are also some shady-looking characters hanging around that square late at night so Pershing Square is not a very good option if you need your car at all times of the day.Advantages:- Gorgeous property.- Within a short walk of some wonderful LA landmarks -- Disney Concert Hall, Angels Flight, The Bradbury and Grand Central Market. The Grand Central Market is a great GREAT place to get lunch. Plenty of wonderful food and unbelievably cheap. Best bang for the buck, in my opinion, of all the places we dined during our stay in LA/Anaheim.- Clean, spacious rooms. My wife loved the king-size bed in our room. Very comfy mattresses and comforters.- Friendly and helpful staff. The valets continued to be very polite and courteous even after I stopped tipping."

Seriously, the lobby, and most of the main floor is really beautiful, but the rooms, and I ended up staying in two, were NOT WORTH it and actually pretty lousy- needed repairs, not that clean etc. Both rooms were so noisy (in the first room, I could hear people talking and a baby crying, it seemed like they were in MY room; I got to hear the lovely sounds of buses, emergency vehicles and drunk people singing all night in the second room). I ended up moving rooms because when I turned on the shower, some-God- knows-what brown stuff came out of the faucet. When I called down to the Front Desk to let them know what was going on, the answer was Whaddya want me to do?. I requested another room was able to move, but received no help moving my bags and NO APOLOGY. It almost made me feel like maybe they're used to hearing about brown stuff coming out of their faucets... I received really good service from Housekeeping and from the people who work in the restaurant Smeraldi's, but not from the Front Desk.I would see if you could get a room at the Sheraton if you're going to visit downtown LA, and come and take pictures of the lobby at the Biltmore."
"Review_11641","hotel_127","hotel_7372","Jun 26, 2008","Wonderful Stay! I stayed at the Biltmore during a recent professional nursing convention with some trepidation. I read reviews that described the rooms as shabby  outdated, the staff as unfriendly, and the neighborhood as unsafe. Travelling across the country alone, I was very nervous about what I had gotten myself into. I could not have been happier with my stay  wonder what was going on with those who had a negative experience. To say that the lobby and the common areas of the hotel are stunning is an understatement. Everything speaks to the rich history of this landmark. I especially enjoyed learning about the hotel's role in the glory days of old Hollywood. The staff was friendly and helpful, directing me to the best ways to get around the city and the things to do. Cabs were very easy to come by, thanks to the staff of the hotel, but I chose to walk to and from the Convention Center each day. I did not ever feel unsafe walking alone downtown. I found the facilities to be more than adequate- the fitness center has a lot of equipment (more than I was expecting, based on one review) and was open around the clock. This was great for someone who was out of sorts with the time change and wide awake at 3 a.m. most days, ready to get going. Although I did not eat in the hotel much, I had a wonderful, if pricey, breakfast at Smeraldi's. For more value, there's a great little coffee shop around the corner on 6th, called the Yorkshire Grill, where I got a delicious breakfast for less than $10, including tip. My room was charming  comfortable. The mattresses have, indeed, been upgraded and the linens were crisp, clean, and of high quality. Yes, the TV was a little small, but who needs to spend much time watching TV when you're in LA? If I wanted to nitpick, I'd say that the bathtub could have been re-glazed. Other than that, my room was perfect. I met several other people staying at other local hotels for the convention who stated they would have rather been at the Biltmore."
"Review_11642","hotel_127","hotel_7565","Jun 21, 2008","Deceptive booking - do not trust I just checked in with a friend to stay one night in downtown LA to see a concert. I specifically booked the hotel because they told me that I could have a room with two double beds. First of all, the line to check in took 20 minutes. When I finally arrived in my room, it was a single king bed. Of course, the clerk that checked me in made no mention of this. I didn't have my reservation in hand when I called to front desk to complain and the clerk actually lied to me and told me that I had booked a room for a single adult. As soon as I logged into my computer, I found that my reservation was, as I had thought, for two adults and two twin beds.Needless to say, I am angry. I could have easily booked a room that I wanted at another hotel if this one wasn't deceptive. Basically, don't believe a word these people say. There are better hotels for the money in downtown LA."

Sure, the rooms may not be as modern as in other nearby big hotels, but this hotel has real character and an impressive history. The grand lobby is stunning, as is the ballroom that hosted some early Academy Award ceremonies. Afternoon tea in the Rendezvous Court was a great experience and not too be missed -- the service, food and setting were excellent.The room showed its age somewhat, but was clean, spacious and had a lovely ensuite bathroom. However, despite being located on a high floor, the room could be noisy at times from street noise. Still, as a business traveller, it was nice to stay at a large hotel that had a distinctive feel."

What a bunch of perfectionists. This hotel was great from check-in to check-out. The staff were without exception attentive, helpful  polite. The public spaces sparkled. Loved the Pool and the Bar. The Ballrooms were amazing. Our room was spacious with a view of the park  the outdoor ice-rink. It felt individual (not like a chain hotel)  was spotlessly clean. I cannot understand complaints from other reviewers about the fascilities. If you want to stay at a Hilton/Ramada etc etc then please feel free. Leave the Biltmore to those travellers who appreciate old world charm with great service. I would choose to ban the business travellers as they just spoil the ambience of places like this. I would stay in this hotel above pretty much any other I have visited in the States and I have stayed in many of the very best. Thank you to all who made this stay so memorable."
"Review_11646","hotel_127","hotel_2315","Jun 4, 2008","Grand old hotel, and it shows in spots We ended up at the Biltmore downtown as part of a group attending a convention nearby. This was my first trip to Los Angeles, and I was a little surprised to discover how little is actually going on downtown, especially after 5pm, when it turns into a bit of a ghost town. There is a Metro stop a couple blocks away, but the public transit system in LA leaves a lot to be desired.As for the hotel itself, most of the reviews that I've read on here are fairly accurate. The hotel is ancient by LA standards, and it shows in the rooms. The lobby and bar areas are very elegant and grand, and they set up your expectations of the rooms perhaps a little too high.When we got to the room we were quite underwhelmed. It was clean enough, but it's just very old. The door to the bathroom was heavy and creaked, the TV was laughable (I think it was 19, and it was very old), and the bed itself was just OK. The mattress was clearly past its prime, although we did see a bunch of new mattresses being loaded into the hotel one day. Apparently they are going to replace all the mattresses this summer.I did enjoy the pool, which is a great old Roman tile type pool, although it would be better if it was open later (closes at 8). The workout room was small but will suffice if you're just looking to jump on the treadmill for 30 mins.The worst part of our stay was getting stuck in an elevator. We were going from the 5th floor down to the lobby when the elevator just stopped. We got management on the phone and they were very concerned and responsive, but there's not much you can do to console people when they're stuck in an elevator. We were in there for about 5 minutes (felt like an hour) when the elevator suddenly sprang back into action, went down to the lobby and the doors opened. Management met us there and seemed very concerned for our well being, although they had no explanation for why the elevator malfunctioned. They offered us passes to the buffet breakfast, which was a nice token gesture but at that point we just wanted to get out of there and go for a walk.The Biltmore clearly is an LA landmark that has seen better days. Without major hotel-wide renovations I don't think we'd stay here again. Certainly don't stay here expecting modern amenities."
"Review_11647","hotel_127","hotel_5117","Jun 2, 2008","Millenium Biltmore - grand ole hotel fraying at the edges My DH and I stayed at the Millenium Biltmore as a part of a business trip for 2 nights in mid May. We chose it mostly because the price was right and the location was reasonable - good access to highways, and close by to some friends. The hotel is a historic property and there is ample evidence of old grandeur in the lobby, bar, and restaurants, which are really quite lovely. It certainly evokes a different era when you step through the doors into the hotel. Our room was suprisingly large with a view of downtown LA. We also had a very large walk in closet - the size of some kitchens in NYC. The bathroom was good sized and had a seperate tub and shower. The shower did not have any place to put anything other than a bar of soap which was a negative. The room has a box TV, desk, and chair.The biggest problem with the room is when you walk in, the first thing you see are very dated linens on the beds. The comforter is literally fraying at the edges and losing its color. The linens were of poor quality and need to be replaced. The carpet in the room was also coming up at the edges of the room and also was not high quality. Those are not things you would expect to encounter at a 4 star hotel. We also could have done without the prom on the Saturday evening of our stay. The lobby turned into an impromptu photo studio and those attending the prom spent a good deal of their time shuttling b/t the dance floor and various hotel rooms in a loud manner.Valet parking is $40 per day, and our car was always ready when we requested it. The hotel charges a fee for internet usage per day. Check in and check out were quick and painless. We did not eat at the restaurants or go to the bar in the hotel.Ultimately this hotel is a high end 3 star hotel, but the above mentioned problems keep it from attaining the 4 star status. Although we would stay at this hotel again if the price was right, we would not seek it out as a place to stay."
"Review_11648","hotel_127","hotel_8374","Jun 2, 2008","Not the best choice in downtown L.A. I really wanted to like this hotel, but can't say I could recommend it to anyone.First of all, I want to say the people that worked there were great. The front desk person checked me in really early and was about as nice as a person could get. The cleaning crew was always smiling and saying hi so I can't say anything but good things about them.The problems with this hotel are three things:1. The hotel building is old. Sure, it's beautiful at the lobby level (actually stunning), but that age also makes the rooms small. I'm sure it may have been sufficient in the 1930's, but it's not even remotely up to par for the 21st Century. The bathroom fixtures are old and they make a lot of noise.2. The room decoration was really cheap. The desk looked like something out of the Sears outdoor furniture collection and the TV.....a 13 incher. C'mon, I can accept the limitations of an old hotel, but a 13 inch TV obviously built in the late 70's or early 80s. I just couldn't believe my eyes. Motel 6's have better TV's than that.3. The street noise, just awful. I've read the management notes on other reviews regarding this and I understand their point, but half of the rooms face the outside streets. You could do better on the lower floors with better insulated windows.I've stayed at older hotels all over the country on business. I've seen how it could be done well. The Roosevelt in Hollywood, The Adolphus in Dallas, the Michelangelo in NYC and the Palace in San Francisco do it right. The Millenium needs to upgrade to be up to the standards of other classic hotels."

"Review_11650","hotel_127","hotel_4495","May 25, 2008","Really expected a lot more I was recently at the Biltmore for a business meeting. When I came to check in, despite the fact that we had made reservations weeks ahead, I was told there were no rooms left. A professional acquaintance of mine happened to arrive a little after I did and after we greeted each other, I was asked by the front desk if we would mind sharing a room!!! Despite not being happy about it, we acquiesced, given that there were no rooms left. Ultimately, after about 45 minutes, we were given a suite that had separate bedrooms, which was fine, but I had not intended to share a hotel room with someone I barely knew...The room was clean, but I must say I expected a little more in quality-the pillows (dense foam) were extremely uncomfortable and the polyester blankets were too hot. I also have to comment that I am extremely disappointed with the service. I had had a package shipped to the hotel in anticipation of a morning meeting the next day. By the time I got up to my hotel room after the check-in fiasco, it was already after 10:00 pm. I'd been told by the front desk that the package would be sent up to my room. At 10:45 pm it still was not there, so I called down to the front desk and informed them I was going to sleep and to please bring it in the morning before my 8:30 meeting. When it had not come in the morning before I had to go to the meeting, I went to the front desk, who sent me to the bell desk, who then called down to the shipping room to locate the package. They asked me to wait while they went downstairs to retrieve it rather than just bringing it to the meeting room. While the building is quite regal and ornate, the service leaves a lot to be desired."

But my compliments end there.I had a very bad experience during my stay which happened to be my wedding weekend. My sister called the Biltmore a few days later to complain and was treated so horribly by MANAGEMENT that I still can't get over it -- and it has been over six months!

To start the lobby is stunning, desk service is great, and the bar is breath taking. I stay at hotels every week for work of varying quality so I鈥檓 not a typical civilian when it comes to hotels. With this in mind I have to say this way the LOUDEST hotel I have ever stayed. Between the street traffic and the room doors slamming at all hours I got little to no sleep. Most hotels have loud AC systems that you can kick up to create a white noise buffer to mask the surrounding noise but this place has the quietest AC systems I have encountered. The windows are single pane which does nothing to keep the constant street noise out. My coworker slept with ear plugs and said that they made little difference. The rooms are pretty stark as well; no art work or head boards in the room I was given. I will not stay here again if I can help it."

FYI Valet parking at the hotel if you are leaving your car there over night for any length of time is $40.

But I am glad they have not applied liberal amounts of botox (unlike the rest of LA) . The age is part of the charm. The biggest problem is that my third floor room was too close to the smoking floor and the smoke filled the elevator area on the non-smoking level. Bad, very bad. Who still allows smoking anyway? If you hate smoke, you should ask how close you are to the smoking floor before accepting the room. The bar was nice. Greg, the bartender, has a fabulous drink called a French Kiss. If you like the girly, sweet martini, this is a must. The staff was pleasant and accomodating, the rates are reasonable. I'm not a big fan of LA in general, but if business calls me back again, I hope I can stay at the Biltmore."

I had to travel to L.A. for business and needed a hotel downtown. I was told that the Biltmore was a nice place with good services. Unfortunately, that could not be farther from the truth. Although the common areas of the hotel are beautiful, the roooms are badly outdated. The bed is extremely uncomfortable and the bathroom is tiny and grimy. The hotel gym is nothing more than a hallway with some old free weights and equally old cardio machines. The most disturbing thing about the hotel, however, is the utter lack of professionalism of its staff. Other than the concierge, the staff is unfriendly, not knowledgeable and generally unhelpful. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive which is not unusual, but it is untimely, often taking a day longer than promised, which is totally unacceptable when you are trying to do business. I recommend that anyone considering this hotel reconsider immediately. You will absolutely be disappointed in your choice. The Hilton Checkers is across the street and is a much nicer and professional establishment. I will never stay at the Millenium again."

The day we checked in, our room had 2 full beds. At the rate we were paying, we could've at least gotten the room we requested. We contacted the front desk and were told: There's nothing we can do, we're sold out. I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager was unavailable for the night!

The lobby areas are absolutely beautiful--felt like I was in a fine art museum. Even the ceilings are magnificent. I also liked the historical nature of the hotel--with pictures of the original Academy Awards banquets held here. The back lobby near the restaurants is a quiet and elegant place to have coffee or a light breakfast from the coffee bar located there.We were there on the weekend and found the area to be quiet, safe and clean. We walked to the MOMA and Disney Concert Hall easily and quickly.Now, the rooms are as described, although ours may have been better than some. It was very large and clean, but there was a large empty area near the doorway which could have benefited from a sofa or easy chairs. It was simply empty. Also, the towels in the bathroom were thin and hard--that would be easy enough to fix despite the historic nature of the hotel. There was a large stain on one bedspread and the desk was badly peeling paint with a piece of glass over it. A simple paint job would take care of that.I probably would stay there again due to location and beauty of the public areas, but would ask if there are any recently renovated rooms."

We were excited about staying at a 4 star property right in Downtown LA. I had HOPED for the Omni, but got the Biltmore, but was willing to give it a shot.I should of known from the get-go of $40/nt to park, that I was in for the unexpected! PS- park in Pershing Square for $14/nt(which is RIGHT across the street) The lobby was beautiful but the ladies at the check-in counter were not what I'd expect at a 4 star property--lazy looking and not friendly, very unprofessional and probably not that fluent in English. The hotel is old and I took that into consideration. Our room was on the 8th floor and we found it to be comparable to a 2 star hotel back home in CO. It had basic ammenities (ie. bath, beds, desk, tv). I've stayed at several hotels and this has to rate as one of the worst in this category--it's a Super 8 quality. I expected MUCH more! You had to pay to use the phone (even local calls), the internet, etc. The restaurants are overpriced. Watch out for the bar window in the tea area-- 2 whiskey and cokes = $30. The pool area needs updating. The ambience and the look of the tiles, made it feel run down and dirty--time to brighten up your basement oasis!! Unlike other reviewers, we didn't find noise to be a problem.Few tips for future guests:1) use your cell phones and go to the public library a block away for internet2) downtown LA closes on the weekends in PM including restaurants and Starbucks--I kid you NOT! Strangest phenomona I saw my whole trip!3)there's a Domino's pizza on the same block which we utitlized 2 times b/c there were no other choices on a Sunday night4)don't ask the staff to aid you in finding anything outside of the hotel. we asked where the closest food or McDs was and they sent us to Little Mexico --SCARY!5) don't expect the gentlemen in the suits by the entrance doors to open them for you--not sure what their job is but obviously not to interact w/ guests.After a 3 day stay--never again will I venture to the Biltmore, nor to downtown LA--it was a HUGE disappointment for a first time Cali trip!"

We got a great rate from Hotels.com and the stay exceeded both our expectations. The staff was outstanding from front desk to floor maids. The decor is just breathtaking! The pool area was a throwback to the art deco era. The rooms are tastefully decorated and comfortable. The lobby is a real stunner!Much has been written about the parking fees. The valet parking was a lifesaver after a long day of siteseeing, and also great to have the car brought out first thing as we started our day. Parking valets were AWESOME! They were courteous and friendly. I never felt like tipping was required, they were very personable and efficient. I was more than satisfied with the service.I would not hesitate to stay there again. Perfect for a girls weekend! Everyone from valet attendants to concierge were cheerful and helpful.HINT: if renting a car, bring or rent a GPS system. That saved our nerves and made the weekend stress-free as we traveled from LA, to Hollywood, to Venice, to Anaheim, to Beverly HIlls. No small feat for two Midwesterers!"
"Review_11671","hotel_127","hotel_7546","Jan 29, 2008","Old world grandeur Old world grandeur at this downtown hotel. Rooms are varied in size. Our smoking club floor room was very large; immaculate with a European decor flavor. The downside was the one person only bathroom with its ancient fixtures in really urgent need of upgrade. That is just a heads-up, not enough of a problem to keep you away.Staff was nice, courteous...almost. Their Sports Bar was very busy; the staff was unable to cope with the situation exemplified by the person answering the phone stating they were too busy to answer how long a wait there was for a table there. Fortunately, there are other choices in the hotel as well as nearby.If you are looking for a downtown hotel, the property is a good option. (Especially if you are into buying wholesale jewelry since the jewelry marts are close by.)"
"Review_11672","hotel_127","hotel_8739","Jan 24, 2008","Gentleman Club feeling Bang in the middle of downtown LA where there really is nothing to do. Around the corner was a Starbucks and few other small sandwich shops but nothing spectacular or interesting.It's close enough to all the freeways if you need to drive and in that sense it's very convenient. We hired a car and it took us maybe 30 mins to drive from the airport. They were charging US$40 a night for parking which you can take the car in and out as you please - usual tips to the drivers. There is parking a plenty around the hotel and prices were about US$20 but I never could be bothered to park and walk to the hotel.I think GRAND is the word you can use to describe the hotel. It's got a nice entrance, lobby, bar and restaurant. Very acceptable. The gym is quite old as is the equipment - feels like you're working out in an old turkish bath area.Rooms are OK... big and spacious but the beds are way too soft. It can get quite noisy being downtown (the occasional fire engine or police car screaming past). There's no kettle in the room so you have to use the coffee machine to boil your water.I paid about US$190 per night, staying for 2 nights. Not bad overall... but I'd prob want to try another hotel next time I'm in LA. Didn't do enough to convince me to stay again."
"Review_11673","hotel_127","hotel_3050","Jan 22, 2008","Beautiful Common Spaces, Rooms are Tired I stayed here for 5 nights in conjunction with a business-related symposium at the convention center. Common spaces are beautiful - very grand, elegant, and ornate.I would describe my room as tired and in need of some refurbishment and a good cleaning. There were no wash cloths the first night, an ice bucket liner was not provided, (and the self that holds the ice bucket in the ice machine was missing), my night stand was dirty, there was a black hair in one of the bathroom glasses, grout and spackle had not been cleaned off the tub enclosure and tiles, I found a black bobby pin on the floor, one of two safes in my room had been left locked (the bigger, more easily accessible one which could hold a lap top) and the handicap grab bar in my bathtub was broken. The repair man came to fix the grab bar while I was unpacking and I shooed him away until the next day. It was not fixed the next evening when I returned to my room. I did complain to the front desk about the grab bar and the safe. The grab bar was fixed.There are very limited dining options on Sunday evenings - both Sai Sai and the sports bar were closed (and there were two play-off games that evening!). An imported beer at the bar cost me $6.50 but you are given a bowl of mixed nuts (no peanuts) that is refilled. I thought the food at Esmereldi's was very good, but pricy ($12 for my glass of wine), however, subsequent dining in the downtown area at other restaurants revealed this to be in line with other nice dining options. The food at Sai Sai was also very good, but pricy."

We later added a New Year's package (including dinner, a party, and breakfast.) Upon arrival, the reception desk had lost our reservation, and offered us a significantly higher price. (A very professional marketing manager was helpful in making sure that they respected the original, printed price.) Our 11th-floor (smallish) room had a comfortable, king-sized bed. We arrived for dinner at 7:55 pm and left over 3 hours later, NOT because we were lingering over the meal, but because Smeraldi's had the worst service we have ever experienced, especially with a prix fixe menu! Everyone around us was either complaining to the Manager or simply leaving before completing their meal. The food was acceptable, but there were billing errors. The New Year's party following was fun, with Latino dance music and champagne at midnight. Happy 2008, but not to be repeated in 2009. By the way, downtown LA is a great place to walk around."

It's in a surprisingly great location. They have a shuttle service to Universal Studios, the metro is a very short walk ( or the same shuttle will drop you off there as well ) and it's only one stop to Hollywood Boulevard. We even received a Christmas present from hotel management. Unfortunately, Beverly Garland passed away just a few weeks earlier. We'd like to offer our condolences. We recommend this hotel if you're visiting Hollywood or Universal studios."
"Review_11684","hotel_128","hotel_9416","Dec 28, 2008","Handy for Universal Studios but that's all We stayed 3 nights at the Beverly Garlands Holiday Inn, it was easy to find as just off the freeway. It's really close to Universal Studios and they do lay on a shuttle bus to take you there, if you catch the time right that is as we found it sat on the car park most the time and it was quicker to walk, as this bus also drops at the metro station (or so we were told, we never actually caught it). Our room was of the bog-standard variety and did us for the 3 nights its a shame it's so far out of the way we had to catch the metro and buses everyday to do any sight seeing. But on the bright side the metro is very cheap and if your doing alot of travelling it's worth getting a day ticket. We did have breakfast one morning at the BG and the pancakes  maple syrup were great. Watch out for the guy standing outside the hotel who wants to sell you tours, he caught us the second we walked out of the hotel and before we knew it we where on a 4 hour tour of LA and $120 lighter. Rob who was our tour guide was great and there was only 2 other people on the trip so that was a bonus. There are lots of tour companies doing the same routes whether the cheaper ones are as good I just couldn't say."
"Review_11685","hotel_128","hotel_2424","Dec 27, 2008","Perfect find! We stayed at this Holiday Inn for five nights in the beginning of December at the start of a mini tour of the States. We stayed in this hotel to explore LA and can honestly say we were not dissapointed. I had emailed the hotel prior to our stay to advise that it was a surprise for my partner (this was his 40th birthday present!!) and when we checked in the receptionist wished Steve a happy birthday and advised that they had upgraded our room to a larger corner room with a fridge - fantastic!! We checked in to our room on the fifth floor and it was spacious and extremely clean. You can tell this isnt a brand new hotel but everything was in good working order and kept extremely clean and tidy. We had lots of storage space, a very comfy king size bed and a nice balcony overlooking the Hollywood hills and tennis courts. There was a function room below and we did experience some noise, but this finished reasonably early and I cannot say it bothered us. There are tennis courts, a gym, swimming pool and a small shop at the hotel. There is also a restaurant and bar, we only used the restaurant once for breakfast on the day we left. It was very nice but seemed very quiet in the evenings. Ironing board  Iron, TV (not flat screen), Hairdryer all in room. NO Safes. Parking was not a problem - charged $12 per night. Easily accessible to get to all the sights. Right off the interstate, so you could hear the traffic but nothing major. It was nice staying at this hotel, as you felt safe and it was in a nice residential area but close to all the attractions - would definately reccomend!"

It was clean and quiet with all the relevant amenities one would expect for a 3 star hotel. The hotel had a minibus to take their guests to Universal Studios every hour (which was v convenient and it only took only 5mins) and the Concierge was v helpful with giving directions and organising tours to downtown LA, the Chinese Theatre, Beverly Hills etc. Foodwise, the onsite restaurant is OK but a little bit pricey. For decent food head to CityWalk at the side of Universal Studios (although it's still pricey!). This hotel is not close to anything else except for Universal Studios  Warner Bros Studios.

I know there's no reported hauntings there or anything but in room 206 there was something like that going on. We were constantly hearing noises through the night coming from INSIDE OUR room. We didn't want to say anything not wanting to sound dumb, but after leaving my husband asked me if i heard anything at night and then we started comparing the things that we herd. We experienced things such as: faint knocking sounds on door and on table inside the room when no one was there or even awake, shuffling, items moving, window squeaking, and also shadows. This may sound strange, but that's what happened to us during our stay at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn. It's not a big deal or anything just thought we'd give future guests to room 206 a heads up.

We are a 5 person family from Norway, and had to have 2 rooms. We got connecting rooms, which we were very happy with. We were all together, and we had lots of space at the same time. We enjoyed the comfort of two bathrooms 2 TV's as which was fine, since the oldest and the younger children had different interests. We were very happy with: The rooms, the service of the staff, the possibility to bath in the pool, and the possibility to wash our clothes in the valet laundry.We also have to mension the fabulous service we got from Sonia at the Tula's Cafe. The breakfast was always. Our daughter Karianne was became very fond of her. All in all we don't have anything negtive to say about our stay. The only thing that keeps us from top score is that we never got any resonse to the e-mails we sent to the Hotel with a few questions before we arrived. If we get a chance, we will be back.

We ate in the on site Tula's restaurant on our first night. Menu was typical though plentiful and good quality. Service was very efficient too. Didn't try the bar area. Ate at Tula's for two breakfasts too. Again typical menu and albeit a buffet offered, we stuck to the menu as the buffet was simple.We stayed in one of the family rooms with one king and a bunk bed for our two children. Room was large and comfortable and more than adequate. Included was a mircowave that we did not use, non-stocked (but working fridge) plus LCD TV.The on-site pool looked great, though we did not use. Open from 08.00am to 10.00pm. Towels were available and always on the beds in the morning. Seemed the pool was *not* popular as there was always free beds. So if you were looking for a relaxing day by the pool, there's no need to awake at stupid o'clock to resreve a bed!Fantastic location, about 5 minutes drive from Universal City. There's a free shuttle to and from Universal every hour. We did not take this service as we wanted to use the hire car and be in control of our own timings. This was a professionally run accommodation and everyone was pleasant and happy to help. Would I recommend, yes!"

The beds are comfortable and the balconies are a nice feature. The front desk and gift shop personnel are very nice. The men who run the shuttle spend far too much time trying to sell tours. The hotel offers a shuttle to Universal and/or the metro. This sounds great, but is very limited. It does not run for about 3 hours during the day and the last shuttle pick up is 9:15pm even though the park is open until 9 and city walk is open until at least midnight. DO NOT EAT At TULA's, the hotel's only dining option. I can honestly say, I have never had food as bad as this place. After a day of flying from Mass to Calif, we went in for a quick bite. First, nothing happens quickly here. I watched 2 different parties leave after not being acknowledged. I ordered a hambuger, my son a reuben, and young son ordered a kids chicken meal. There is no way my hamburger was cooked that day!! It was old. Chicken meal was almost black, and reuben was on stale bread!

There's also a great gym, small pool which does pool-side drinks and food service. The shuttle buss runs hourly too and from Universal and is very prompt.

For a start this doesnt appear to be usual procedure for Holiday Inn despite what their website says, so I was happy with that. The room was on the 7th floor and was two rooms knocked into one, so was spacious. One side contained the bed and bathroom and the other side had a living area and another bathroom (so they could convert back into 2 rooms easily I guess).The 'rooms' were separated by a wooden lattice panel, giving the room a kind of Eastern feeling. The decor was nice, neutral tones and exposed, painted brickwork and we had a large plasma screen hanging from the wall on a swivel pole so we could turn it round and watch from either the bedroom or living space. The bed was super comfy !To be honest we didnt spend enough time at the hotel to check out any of the dining facilities or pool so I cant comment on them, but the room was great, the desk clerk was really welcoming and also gave us a bag of free stuff, water, chocolate etcWe spent our free afternoon at Universal city Walk, and theres a shuttle bus from the hotel that picks up and drops off every hour or so, so convenientWe've talked about holidaying in the Hollywood area again so would definitely look at staying here again"
"Review_11709","hotel_128","hotel_1763","Jul 18, 2008","Not As Bad As Everyone Thinks I stayed at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn starting on July 13th-16th 2008. I took the time and read the reviews regarding the hotel and took everything in. Some people stated on the reviews that the food was horrible and that the area wasn't safe. Here is an honest review that I hope helps everyone from a frequent hotel traveler. The hotel is outdated and is in need of a few face lifts including new carpeting in the hallways. The hallways could also use a bit more lighting but it isn't scary. The room was clean and came with a coffee maker, hairdryer, tons of towels (we had 4 adults in our room) and an iroining board etc. Our room was kept clean and we never had a problem. We stayed in the Eldorado building which if sitting outside on the small balcony (large enough for two people to sit) the sound of the freeway is noticeable. BUT, once you are inside the room with the airconditioning on, you can't even hear it. Our group didn't have any problem sleeping. When we arrived we were asked about taking tours and we simply said that we were there for business so we didn't have time-we weren't asked again and I never felt pressured or pushed to attend a tour. We took advantage of the coffee shop and I experienced an okay chai latte, but not a big deal. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning which costs $11.95. I personally felt that this was a bit steep considering what was offered and felt that if it was around $7.95 that would be better-but the food was good. The eggs were egg beaters but it wasn't terrible. The area surrounding the hotel is safe. We attended an event about three blocks up and was able to walk back to the hotel at 11:00pm without an issue. The only issue that I had was that we had to pay for parking. Now, I was only charged $11.00 a day vs the $13.00 I am hearing but I still think that this is ridiculous since I was staying at their hotel and already giving them money via the hotel room. This wouldn't make me not stay there again, but I would look for a place that maybe didn't charge as much. The location is not far from Universal Studios and there is a shuttle that is offered by the hotel to get you there. The shuttle does not pick up at the airport-please keep that in mind when making plans. I hope this helps.."
"Review_11710","hotel_128","hotel_8234","Jul 15, 2008","Good location We enjoyed out stay at the Beverly Garland.Location:The location of the Beverly Garland is good鈥搄ust off the freeway with easy access to Disney (took us about an hour but the traffic is crazy). There are a number of Hollywood/LA tours you can book right at the hotel. The bus stops at the hotel to pick you up and you really don鈥檛 have to travel far. The shuttle to Universal is great BUT when you鈥檙e returning home at night remember that a ton of other guests will be returning as well and there may not be room for you (which means you wait for the next shuttle). FYI: spend the extra $$$ and take the VIP Tour at Universal. Great value for money and if you don鈥檛 book it you will probably spend your day hating those (and yourself) with the VIP cards who go right past you in line and who get to get off their trams and explore the sets while you sit on your tram and simply drive by. While at the Beverly we spent a day at Universal, a day touring Hollywood and a day at Santa Monica Beach (not a bad drive at all considering it is LA).Rooms: No fridge but otherwise fine. Nice, simple accommodation. You probably don鈥檛 want a room on the ground floor since these rooms are actually 鈥榙ownstairs鈥?and really only have a view of the hill they鈥檙e built into. We started out on the second floor and had sewage back up in the tub (gross, but they moved us immediately, no problem) and ended up on the first floor right near the pool. Very convenient. There is laundry in one of the buildings.Pool: Small but nice. Always loads of loungers. Snack bar and towels. There鈥檚 a hot tub and sauna too but we didn鈥檛 use these.Food: I liked Tula鈥檚. The menu had loads of variety and the prices were reasonable. Concerns: My concerns are not so much about the hotel but have more to do with the fact that I booked this hotel because of its review in Frommer鈥檚. Frommer鈥檚 stated that kids under 12 eat free. That didn鈥檛 happen for us and I鈥檓 not sure why鈥揑 was just told that we didn鈥檛 have that package. Maybe Frommer鈥檚 should indicate you have to buy a special package to get this. Also, Frommer鈥檚 indicated Free Parking. That also did not happen鈥搘e paid $13 a day I believe. Minor things, I know, but these were two reasons I booked here so I was annoyed.This is a very pleasant family hotel and a good location from which to sightsee. There鈥檚 really not much around the hotel itself (very residential) but I would recommend it as a base from which to do Universal and see LA."
"Review_11711","hotel_128","hotel_9010","Jul 14, 2008","Disappointed by the beg bug We chose this hotel because it was close to universal studios,it was the cheapest in the area and it provided free shuttle service to universal studios. The staff was nice and friendly. No problem with the sevice at all. The food was good little pricey but okay. The rooms appeared to be clean. The first morning I got up went to my aunt's room . She and her granddaughter were still in bed. I noticed a red stain on the sheet of the bed the 9 year old was sleeping in. I approached the bed and then observed little bugs. I smashed the bug with a piece of paper and it stained the sheet, looked like a blood stain. Would you know it BED BUGS. We called immediately to the front desk, we were told the manager was not on site. They sent up the engineer he checked behind the headboard with a flashlight. An hour later someone else came to the room and he tried to tell us that these bugs came in sliding door because it was open and that they were not bed bugs. Not knowing that we had caught them in a plastic bag and showed him the evidence that these were in fact BED BUGS. He finally agreed to not charge us for that night. Moved them to another room. After that our stay was good."

The staff were very friendly and the room we had was big and spacious. It is only about a 20 min walk to Universal Studios which was great and the subway/metro is right near Universal. We had the buffet breakfast each morning which was quite nice although I wished they had more continental stuff to choose from! Our room was cleaned every day we were there - I have no complaints at all - it was actually the quietest hotel we stayed in throughout our 3 week holiday - which involved going onto Hawaii and San Francisco!!"

It was clean, the staff were friendly and I did not notice any noise from the motorway. The reason I chose this Hotel was its relatively close proximity to Hollywood. There is a five minute walk to the subway/rail station and then one stop and you walk out right at the Chinese theatre, this was perfect for us as we went out clubbing at the Tropicana and the Roosevelt Hotel.Overall this Hotel provides clean accomodation and serves perfectly as a base for those who wish to go out drinking in Hollywood."

We are two young italian sisters and we went to United States alone for the first time on Feb 2007 to see the Oscar event in real life. We decided to stay at Beverly Garland Holiday Inn and we had a very nice time there! It is not so close to Hollywood and you can't reach by walk the most important attraction of the town but with a short walk you can reach the subway that easily take you wherever you want in LA and surrounding area . The walk from-to the subway takes about 15 minutes. The staff is friendly and help you to do whatever in you, for example we had a problem to phone in Italy when we arrived and they helped us to show how to do it...they booked all the excurions for us and suggested which places to see. The rooms are big, with big beds for europen people, they were clean and nice. To enter in the rooms block you don't need to pass in front of the reception if you don't want, they have a separate access and you can enter only with your key-card. They have a swimming pool. They also have a restaurant very close to it, you can reach it in a very short walk. they offer breakfast and dinner ( the only thing is that the menu was always the same, but that's it ). Beside this restaurant there are not very close places to eat or to shop. Anyway, they also have free shuttle to and from the Universal Studios. Anyway, we suggest this hotel to people with a car because is very close to the freeway but we had no problems even if we did not have a car, so if you don't mind walking from and to the subway, it is a nice hotel. And then, you are in LA, close to the hotel there are typical houses, there is Starbucks ( not too close) and Los Angeles is simply amazing!!!"

We visited Universal Studios, Hollywood, and Burbank, and found the hotel to be centrally located. The highlight of my experience of this hotel was the comfortable bed. Although I chose not to take advantage of it, the hotel offered a pillow menu giving us the opportunity to change the type of pillows we had depending on whether we slept on our back, side, etc. The staff was extremely friendly right down the the security guard. The room was a little small, but clean. The grounds were clean, and there were a lot of trees around the hotel. The only real disadvantage I could find to our room was the level of freeway traffic noise. The hotel is located right next to a major freeway, and I had a little difficulty getting to sleep the first night we stayed. I purchased ear plugs for our second night, but didn't end up using them because I fell asleep pretty quickly after sinking into our comfy bed. We ate at Tulas on our second evening. The food was pretty good, but a little overpriced for what we got. Overall, I considered our stay at this hotel a positive experience."

"Review_11736","hotel_129","hotel_4450","Aug 26, 2008","Clean, comfortable and well priced Stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge for work for 3 nights. The hotel feels somewhat like it has been stuck in 1962, complete with kitschy astroturf ringing the pool. The room that I had was on the 3rd floor and faced the pool. This only presents a problem if you want to get to sleep early as the pool is frequented until about 11pm. Room and furnishings appear to have been updated within the last few years and were quite clean and well kept. Hallways and lobby are beginning to show their age but are quite clean. The hotel restaurant was under renovation during my stay so a temporary dining room had been set up in one of the hotel's conference rooms. The wait staff still appeared to be ironing out the details of this change. As I only had breakfast (cereal and fruit) at the hotel I can't comment on the quality of the food though the selection looked decent for all meals. Staff at reception were quite friendly and happily made taxi reservations to the airport, etc. Overall the hotel is comfortable, clean and offers a decent value for LA area."
"Review_11737","hotel_129","hotel_9450","Aug 26, 2008","Good hotel except for the flies On arrival our room was not ready as we were early however the Receptionist was very helpful, booking a trip for the next day for us. We had asked for a 'city view' room thinking we would be able to see downtown but we just had a view of a grassy wooded area in which there must have been some stagnant water. We opened the patio to have a look round when we first got into the room  noticed the fly screen but didn't pay much attention to it. (we've never used one). Unfortunately we left the door open which was enough time for a few flies to join us. Daft as it may seem I couldn't sleep that night although my husband had got rid of all the flies we could see at the time, and he got rid of a couple more when we came in later on - I just felt like there were things crawling on me all night. (There weren't!). It would have been better if there had been a note on the doors warning you to keep the fly screen closed at all times. I was absolutely shattered the next day when we were doing most of our sightseeing. Other than this the room was spacious and the beds very comfortable. A coffee maker was provided plus a fridge and there was a hairdrier and an iron and ironing board. There was no safe in the room and when we asked for one of the safety deposit boxes at Reception there were none left. One of the Receptionists said he would let us know if one became available but one didn't. We had a problem with the sink not draining when we arrived (would have thought the maid would have spotted that when she cleaned the room prior to our arrival?) We reported it and someone came to fix it quite quickly. The toilet also sometimes needed to be flushed twice but that was not a major problem. The room had a connecting door which was a bit disconcerting when the people next door sounded like they were trying to come through. The dividing railings between all the balconies are also quite low, and there are warnings to keep doors locked at all times. There was a fixed head shower in the bathroom and the wardrobe had 10 hangars. There was a laundry facilty at the hotel which can be quite useful if you are travelling around a lot. The pool area was nice and used by lots of people, towels were provided . There was a bar at one end. One morning we were going out very early and ordered a room service breakfast, eggs  sausage  toast. Don't bother - it was all at varying stages between lukewarm and cold. The next day we went down to the cafe which was better although we waited a while to be served.Internet access was available just off the lobby by using cash or credit card. The location is convenient for road access but there is not a lot nearby if you are wanting to explore on foot. We got a taxi up to Studio City in the evening but not as much to do there as we had hoped.Wouldn't stay there again but probably OK if you are driving everywhere and you get a room with a pool view."

The room was comfortable for 3 of us with plenty of space and it was clean. The service at the front desk was generally very good. We used the free shuttle service to Universal Studios and they also booked us tickets.From the bedroom we had a view of the pool and the hills beyond which I would recommend asking for. The pool was big and warm. At night they put candles around the pool which made it look very attractive. When we were there they were just about to host their annual cowboy gathering ( real ones and film ones!) and so there was some nice singing around the pool by men in stetsons! We also got chating to a guy who claimed he was a TV director- real LA!! Breakfast was served in the restaurant and you could order food around the pool.

"Review_11740","hotel_129","hotel_10213","Jun 25, 2008","Great place to stay! I have stayed here two times with my family and we couldn't have been more satisfied with the place. I'll admit that it is outdated, for the most part, although some rooms were renovated a couple of years ago but the rooms remain very clean and spacious. The hotel has two restaurants, one casual and the other white tablecloth, and both offer excellent food at reasonable prices. The Olympic-size pool is wonderful for serious swimmers and frolickers alike, and a cute tiki bar offers every favorite libation. The grounds around the hotel could use some sprucing up, though. Some staff members seemed a little indifferent to the needs of guests but most were nice enough.The neighborhood is safe and walkable with many restaurants and shops located up and down Ventura Blvd., including a Ralph's grocery store just across the street that is open 24 hours. The location, itself, is very convenient to any other area attractions that beckon tourists.I highly recommend staying here if you don't mind a laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere. The rates are reasonable and the parking is free, which normally isn't the case in the LA area. I would definitely stay here again and again."

The wireless service was spotty, especially in the mornings. I wouldn't have minded paying for it if it had worked properly. Will I stay again? Not sure. Great deal for tourists but not necessarily for business folks.One additional note. I saw some of the other reviews where guests complained about the decor, the food, etc. Come on, folks, what are you expecting for prices like this? You want five-star hotel services, book a room at $300/night hotel. This is a decent, relatively inexpensive place to stay."

When one is expected, we tend not to give one.We entered our room and were pleasantly surprised by the size and nice appointments. It was an alcove room, which was an upgrade.The far wall was all windows. The view was incredible.The only time I heard another guest was from our restroom. The bedroom was extrememely quiet and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the linens were just as amazing.Check out was a breeze.My only complaints were the distance we had to walk from the elevator and that the water pressure in the shower was very low.

My initial impression of the hotel was favorable, as the staff were very courteous, the room was spacious and I received a complimentary fruit basket on my first night there. However, upon waking up the first morning, I found bed bugs in my bed. This was a horrifying and unwelcome surprise at 5:30 AM. I immediately called the front desk and was put on hold for 10 minutes, after which I explained the situation to the night supervisor and requested to be given another room immediately. During this conversation with the night supervisor, at no time did she apologize, although she did agree to provide another room by 6:30 AM. Upon moving to my new room, I inspected the bed carefully and found that while the sheets appeared to be clean, under the mattress, on the dust ruffle and around the headboard there was a great deal of dirt, dust and human hair. It was obvious the full bedding had not been changed or cleaned in some time. I did try to reach the hotel manager, and he did try to contact me during my stay, but we missed each other as I was in meetings most of the time there. I will follow up with a letter to him about the situation and give him a chance to respond, but as of right now, no discount was given to me on my bill and the only apology I received was from the front desk clerk when I went down to exchange room keys. My recommendation is that if you stay at this hotel, you should carefully check the bedding before going to sleep."

The air was not on in the room and our thermostat read 90 degrees, it took hours for it to cool down. My bf sat on the bed and the bead was broken, the box spring was split in half. we called the front desk and they said they could put us on another floor which we did not want to do b/c we were already unpacked and had booked our rooms next to one another. They said they would send someone up to exchange it, never happend. So we just slept on it. One of guests went to get into the bed and a nasty bottle of lotion was in the sheets- obviosly the sheets were not changed. she requested her sheets to be changed and someone came up and gave her the sheets but he said I dont do sheets she had to change them herself.

Seriously, there is nothing special about this place, except that it is a short stroll from Universal Studios.The place is quite dated, the type of hotel lobby that was nice in the 80s, but needs an upgrade.It's OK- well equipt, but seriously nothing special. Stay only if necessary, otherwise, keep looking!PS really bad location if you are wanting to see other sights in LA. So far from everything."
"Review_11758","hotel_130","hotel_9322","Oct 27, 2008","Fantastic hotel - couldn't have asked for more!!! My husband and I and our 3 children just recently stayed at the Hilton in Universal City whilst we were visiting the US. The hotel was fantastic!!! Best location for visiting Universal studios and for seeing the sights of LA (we did have a car though). Universal studios was across the road so we had no worries about trying to get through the LA traffic to get there on time. Universal City was next door and that was fantastic for dinners, lots of child friendly restaurants and shops and we felt very safe strolling through the area at night. There was a free shuttle back to the hotel if we wanted to use it rather than walking, we did take advantage of that on a few nights after we had been walking all day!! The room itself was great - large, clean and great views! We were worried as we had two rooms and wanted interconnecting but that was no problem which was a great relief. We stayed on the executive level which included a free continental breakfast each day which was fantastic! Nice and healthy - fresh fruit, cereal, coffee, toast, yoghurt etc..Great start to the day.I was really happy that we stayed at this hotel it was the first hotel we stayed at on our holiday and we returned to it on our last night before leaving the US. Would highly recommend it to anyone!!!!"

Don't book with HILTON !!!I booked this hotel because I needed to run the LA Marathon.The LA Marathon moved the date two weeks earlier.I called and emailed Hilton to see if I could change my reservaton. Multiple calls and emails later, they still said No, sorry, can't modify or cancel your reservation even though it was a month ahead of time!Beware! If you are staying in this caliber of hotel anyway, book with another chain, and avoid the Hilton chain and its affiliate hotels. In the past I have had great cusomer service with Hyatt Regency. In fact this is the worst service I have ever encountered even with less expensive hotels."
"Review_11760","hotel_130","hotel_6981","Oct 16, 2008","Couldn't have been more accomodating Decided to attend my High School reunion being held at the Sheraton, but liked the Hilton better, so decided to stay there for that night. I needed a double-bed room, as I needed to bring my disabled mother (whom I care for) and we need to have our own beds.The hotel was very busy that Saturday, and when we checked in, the desk clerk said they only had a room with a king bed...NO WAY! I had reserved a double bed room!, I explained, as I pointed to my mother waiting at the side in her wheelchair.The desk clerk got my drift, and was very understanding. She began punching in buttons on her computer and making calls, and wha-lah, a recently vacated room popped up. Yeah!The only complaint is that the air conditioning did not seem to work...could not adjust cooler or more fan circulation. The bellhop said he could try to get us a fan (accomodating and extremely nice man), but apparently, none was to be found.I ordered room service for Mom and then talked with the desk. They said that if I left them my cell number, they would call me if Mom needed me, and that they would alert security that there was a disabled person in our room (in case of emergency). So nice! After I left to attend the reunion, Mom's dinner was delivered (that person was helpful with getting her to the table and helping with her food preparation), and they later did a physical check-in with her, with a complimentary fruit basket in hand, just to be sure she was O.K. That was above and beyond the call of duty!!! I was so gratefull for their attentiveness to our needs, and that because of that, I was allowed to have a carefree night out (which is seldom, when you are a full-time caregiver!). Everyone, including the bellman who kept Mom company while I retreived our car upon leaving, was exceptionally kind, friendly, professional and accomodating!Thank you, Hilton Hotel!!!KB EdwardsPorter Ranch, CA"
"Review_11761","hotel_130","hotel_1981","Oct 14, 2008","Very nice hotel, but get a car! I stayed at the Universal City Hilton from Oct 1- 5 for a conference and was pleased overall with the hotel itself. I didn't eat at the hotel but the food (especially the seafood buffet) looked absolutely delicious! We had some issues in our room with the phone and the air conditioning but other than that, our view was fantastic and the room VERY spacious. The staff was EXCELLENT. All were extremely helpful and friendly except one lady at the front desk who was not very interested in our complaints concerning the phone/air. Too bad I can't remember her name. Anyway, Billy the bartender was the absolute best! It still ticks me off when I stay in hotels of this caliber but still have to pay for wireless internet. It's either $9.95 per day in room, or $3.00 a minute in the business center.The walk to the metro is close by although down a steep hill so if you have knee problems or are disabled, this will be a little difficult. We took a L.A. tour that picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel. That was convenient. Other than CitiWalk/Universal Studios, there isn't anything else within walking distance of the hotel, unfortunately. You would definitely need to rent a car or use the Metro because the cabs are really expensive due to the never ending L.A. traffic!Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, however, the next time I am in L.A., I prefer to stay in a hotel that is downtown."
"Review_11762","hotel_130","hotel_7999","Oct 10, 2008","Fantastic We had booked an executive room  were upgraded to an Alcove Executive Room upon arrival. Check In was over in less than 5 mins  we were shown to our room on floor 21!! As soon as i entered the room  got to the huge windows I was gobsmacked the views were amazing.We stayed here for a week  went to Universal Studios which was next to the hotel (there is a free shuttleservice every 15 mins from outside the hotel as its located on top af a steep hill). Went to City Walk every night for dining  shopping (again using the shuttle).Went we spoke to the conciege about other site seeing they asked us to hire a car but me  my husband were not confident driving in the USA. Instead we saw many sites by using the LA subway (Metro). Went to Santa Monica Beach - Long Beach - Downtown - Walk Of Fame all using public transport  was very easy!! So do not listen to the conciege when they insist on hiring a car as it can all be done by the metro  bus. Wouls have gone to Venice Beach if we had time as well.We had access to continental breakfast  Drinks  Snacks between 5-7pm every evening on the executive floor which was handy.The rest of the time was spent in the Pool  Hot Tub. As we went when there was a heatwave the temp of the pool was not so bad but i can imagine is being cold if the weather is!! But the hot tub at the end of the day was amazing after a day of site seeing!!Overall a very enjoyable stay  I will highly reccomend this hotel, book executive room if you can!!TIPSCan go to walk of fame  see Hollywood Sign by subway (metro) only one metro stop (hollywood  Highland) from Universal City. Also Long Beach by Metro (can take 45 minutes) but you only have to change Metro once at 7th Street to Long Beach (Blue Line)Santo Monica we got off at 7th Street (Macy's)  got the Big Blue Bus to Santa Monica beach which took just under 1 hour."

This is the only place to stay if you're visiting Universal City and Hollywood and make sure you get the Executive rooms as the lounge with breakfast and afternoon snacks is great. Everything about this hotel is good - food/room/pool/bar/parking etc.We ate at the bar on two nights and it was great and very reasonable with excellent service.Buses to Universal are regular and convenient and we did a hollywood tour by bus from the hotel as well.This really is 5 star with value for money. Oh except for the phone calls - don't use the room phones as international cell phones are cheaper!!"

"Review_11765","hotel_130","hotel_4971","Sep 27, 2008","Great Hotel An excellent hotel especially for visiting universal studios. Great interior to hotel, very nice rooms with very interesting views of LA including lots of mansions on the hills. Attentive staff and excellent breakfast. Nice pool. Takes two minutes to walk to universal and city walk. There's lots of resturants to choose from at city walk. Can't think what its called but we ate at an American steak house type resturant (closest to the hotel when walking to the studios) it was very nice (and cheap of course). Oh and the SImpsons ride was really fantastic at universal!"
"Review_11766","hotel_130","hotel_3127","Sep 25, 2008","Fabulous Hilton Great hotel. Perfect location for Universal studios - five minute walk. Room was huge. Very clean and the bed linen is lovely. Welcome basket of fruit, water, cheese and biscuits was indeed very welcome.We were on the Executive Floor and the continental breakfast and hor d'oeuvres were a real bonus.We ate at Cafe Sierra twice during our stay - delicious. We particularly liked the BBQ buffet - very good value for money. There is also a good choice of restaurants at Citywalk.Other than Universal though there is not a lot within easy walking distance. The Metro station is walking distance but it is down a very steep hill. Unless you are planning on only visiting Universal you really do need a car. The car parking was $17 a day. There were always plenty of parking spaces available.LA Zoo is well worth a visit - only $12 for adults - bargain.I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Hollywood."
"Review_11767","hotel_130","hotel_1794","Sep 19, 2008","Great location and spacious room Can't argue with the location (short walk to Universal Studios, short drive to Hollywood and downtown), or the room which was massive and comfortable with a great bathroom.Price for room was pretty good and they were able to extend our stay by a day (you will need time to explore LA). Only downside were the exorbitant charges for even short local phone calls and internet access. Everyone knows hotels love to charge for any extras, but their prices were outragous and we simply couldn't avoid them due to crcumstances. Breakfast was nice and reasonably priced (extra to cost of room) Overall, pretty good, just a shame they feel they have to rip off tourists who need to make urgent calls."
"Review_11768","hotel_130","hotel_2084","Sep 14, 2008","The Place to Stay This is definitely the place to stay at Universal City... as opposed to the Sheraton. We arrived late and left early, so I didn't really see much of the hotel. There is a $17 self-parking charge for the garage, as with many places.A couple of snafus during my stay: The remote control for the TV didn't work... maybe the batteries were dead? Normally this would be a big deal, but it was late and I was tired, so I just read e-mail and went to bed. Then during the night, staff slid a hotel receipt with no numbers under my door... then replaced it with a receipt with no letterhead. Turns out the night staff had printed out the receipts before doing the audit (according to the beleaguered morning clerk) and so we had to go to the desk to check out in the morning. Frankly, the morning clerk could have been a bit more personable and less grumpy.The room was fine... I'm sure I'll stay here again despite the quirks. It's nicer than the Sheraton."

"Review_11771","hotel_130","hotel_10587","Sep 10, 2008","Loved this fantastic hotel The hilton hotel was fantastic,myself and a friend stayed here in september 2007. We were met at check in by an amazing group of staff, who were friendly and very helpful. We had booked an executive floor room with two double beds. The room was great very big and clean. The bathroom was spotless and came with amenities, towels and bathrobes. Upon arrival the room contained a basket with numerous sweets, fruit etx, which was a nice touch. In the evening the hotel provides a turn down service for executive floor guests, which was pretty cool considering they leave little bags of MMs on your pillow :)Although the room itself was great, the hotel is showing its age, the lobby was a little dated as were the common areas. The lifts were really slow and took there time in getting us to the 23 floor. The executive lounge was great, we had breakfast there most mornings and they provide a wide selection of cereals, fruit, tea/coffee etc, as well as papers. The staff were great. We also enjoyed the free soda and cookies each evening :). Althought the lounge had amazing views of the surrounding area, it was very dated and had a used feeling. The room itself had clearly been a bed room previous and really could do with somoe updating. It was also pretty small, but all in all we loved it!One morning we had breakfast in the lobby restaurant, which was great but we found some of the cups to be dirty and once again it appeared to be a little dated. However, we had a great time and would definitly go back tomorrow."
"Review_11772","hotel_130","hotel_5085","Sep 5, 2008","Great stay at the Hilton! We stayed for a week at the Hilton Universal City the last week of August, 2008. The hotel staff was fantastic, from the pre-arrival dialog and accommodation scheduling to the stay itself. The hotel was busy, but we never had to wait for anything. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and accommodating, helping us with a minor room annoyance and a room upgrade. Try to stay in the executive towers floors 22-24 to take advantage of the lounge with complimentary breakfast, papers, snacks, etc. Concierge was very helpful, checking on locations, printing directions, and making reservations with a smile. Room was a real treat, very pampering and relaxing, cozy but roomy. Great restaurant with superb buffet...fantastic!! The pool and exercise room was great, clean, not crowded and well staffed.It is located a very short walk from Universal Citywalk and the Universal Studios Tour and Park-rides...VERY NICE!!! All of LA is a short drive away, the traffic can be bad so plan ahead. (The only bad part of our vacation to LA was the rental car...DO NOT rent from Dollar...esp the LAX site. Management was extremely poor and non-responsive, vehicle was not well maintained)"
"Review_11773","hotel_130","hotel_6597","Sep 2, 2008","Perfect hotel for LA This was an excellent hotel! We booked through their website for $161 per night (AAA rate) and opted to choose our room when we arrived. This was a great idea, as we ended up getting a MASSIVE room overlooking universal studios, with a seating area, and a very comfy king size bed! The hotel itself was great - the staff were extremely helpful, it had a good coffee bar for the morning, a large bar, and a restaurant with a big buffet breakfast (although we did not eat there). The hotel was in a great location - within walking distance to universal studios, and very close to the City Walk, which was fun at night! We drove to downtown LA (grauman's chinese theatre) in 10 minutes, and were at Rodeo Dr. within 15. This hotel is beautiful and is a great choice if you're looking for something a bit more reasonable priced in central LA. I highly recommend it! Parking wasn't too expensive (I think $17 per day), and the lot was easy to use! I highly recommend this hotel. I have stayed at the Sheraton Universal and this is just as good, if not better."
"Review_11774","hotel_130","hotel_9800","Sep 2, 2008","An Average Stay This hotel was not spectacular but it also was not horrible. For me it was just average. But here are a few things I want to mention regarding the hotel.First, if you are a smoker, I want to let you know that all smoking rooms are only on the 5th floor! Kind of sucks if you ask me. Also, you do get a very nice complimentary basket in your room that has water, fruit, cookies, and cheese  crackers.I felt that they were understaffed for a holiday weekend. It took forever for them to answer the front desk phone. And when we were changing rooms it took them forever to get someone up stairs to bring us the new keys, so we ended up leaving. The nice thing the hotel did was they never rushed us out of the previous room and held the other room for us until we got back later that evening. They were really nice just understaffed.I must say I was a bit baffled that we did not have a room service menu in our room. I had to call room service for them to bring me one and then when they did they first only brought me the breakfast menu that you hang on your door the night before. I had to tell them I already had that I need the binder with the full menu.The valet were extremely nice and helpful! They were always happy to help. We never had a problem asking them for directions to somewhere, they just printed them right out for us. They also suggested a wonderful local place that serves breakfast and lunch only. It's called Good Neighbor. I highly recommend eating there at least once while you are in town. Great food, not expensive at all, and the atmosphere is so friendly. As for the location of the hotel. You really do not have to wait for the Universal Studio shuttle! It's less than a 5 minute walk. You are litterally right across the street from it! Now as for the metro, it is a hike. You have to walk all the way down the hill and cross the intersection to get there. The walk down isn't bad but the walk up is not fun at all! That is a very very very step hill! Now there is a shuttle at the bottom of the hill that will bring you up (drops off at the Universal Studio entrance) and down the hill. I highly recommend taking the shuttle back up. Overall I was not impressed with the hotel, but the staff was friendly. Nothing spectacular just a clean nice place to stay while on vacation."

The only benifit was the free breakfast and soft drinks. But other guests were getting the free breakfast that were staying on the other floors so no idea how this worked?!!!In all we had a good stay in this hotel BUT....... there was a convention going on and the hotel was FULL of police, security people and loads of rude business people.

However, the carpet was very stained and dirty. Whole room needs an update. Bathroom was very roomy. We had access to the Executive Lounge (also needs an update). Do not waste your money on the upgrade. Cold cereal and sweet rolls for breakfast and 2 hot snacks at night with cheese and fruit. For the extra $30-$40 per night you can get a real breakfast. Also, the lounge was so packed while we were there we had to stand and eat.The hotel is very convenient to Universal Studios and City Walk. They have a shuttle they share with the Sheraton that comes every 10-15 minutes.Next time I would stay at the Sheraton which was just updated."
"Review_11778","hotel_130","hotel_7815","Aug 15, 2008","Friendliest staff! I went to the Hilton Universal City earlier this year for a few days away from England. I'm not a huge fan of the Universal City theme park scene myself, but chose the hotel because of a good price deal. I was a little dubious about the fact it was a Universal City hotel, and was a little worried it would be tacky. Not at all. Arriving at the hotel blearly eyed after the 11 hour flight I was greeted by friendly staff who got me to my room in no time! The hotel restaurant serves decently priced (and excellent) Mandarin cuisine, with the friendliest waiting staff I have come across in a long time. The highlight of the stay had to be the warmth of the valet parking staff - they knew me and my car, always greeted me and were very welcoming each time I returned to the hotel. I was actually pleasantly surprised by Universal City Walk too, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel (or a shuttle bus ride away). On top of the usual theme park shops, there are also a fair few decent places to shop (if you're into California-esque surfer type clothes...maybe not for designer labels). The hotel and its location is excellent for families. There are many kid-friendly places to eat in City Walk should young children not necessarily favour the Mandarin cuisine, plus the hotel is within easy reach of anywhere in LA really with a car.The room itself was spacious and clean.Overall I really enjoyed staying here. I easily settled into the Californian lifestyle within 5 days here with all the friendly, relaxed (but professional) staff. Didn't want to leave for the hustle bustle of London at all! Easily could have done another week."
"Review_11779","hotel_130","hotel_6054","Aug 14, 2008","Great hotel - brilliant location! Stayed at Hilton Universal as part of my honeymoon this year and would definitely recommend it. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was lovely. Our room was bigger than average, bright and spacious. Only ate breakfast at the hotel, but this was reasonably priced with plenty of choice for a buffet breakfast. The hotel is linked to Universal Studios, so there is a handy shuttle bus which runs every 15 minutes to Universal itself, which is a ten minute walk away. This is great, as Universal's City Walk is attatched to the park, where there's numerous shops and restaurants. This means that there's always somewhere to go in the evening, which is safe and is in walking distance of the hotel. The hotel is also a short work from the underground metro station and just off the main freeway if you are driving. Overall, a great hotel in a great location. Only downside is that the lifts can be extremely slow at busy times. Would totally recommend a stay here"

"Review_11781","hotel_130","hotel_9959","Aug 10, 2008","Great Hotel We had stayed here two years ago, and returned because of its' proximity to the Gibson Amphitheatre ( we had tickets to the Teen Choice Awards). They have recently added a small take-away coffee shop (breakfast pastries, coffee, fruit, ice-cream) that is a great addition to the hotel.  We found the hotel to be in an excellent position, whether driving (literally two minutes off the freeway ) or using the subway, which is at the bottom of the hill, to get around . Rooms are large. We overlooked the Studios and over to Burbank ,with the Mountains in the distance. The views with all the lights on at night, and then the sun coming up in the morning were fantastic. Beds were very comfy, with nice linens. Plenty of towels in the bathrooms. We also had two safes in the room - a small one with a turnkey and another larger one with a punch code. Huge range of restaurants to choose from at CityWalk, which can be reached by a 5 minute walk, or wait for a tram at the front door. There was a large convention going on while we were there, but we heard no noise from any rooms during our stay.  Lots of self-parking space, although valet is available is you want. All staff we met were friendly and courteous. So glad we decided to go back to the Hilton Universal City."

"Review_11783","hotel_130","hotel_1556","Jul 25, 2008","Loved the Hilton The Hilton in Universal City was a great choice for us. We travelled to LA in June as a young couple for sightseeing. The Hilton had everything and more you want in a hotel. The rooms were a good size and nice, with great amenities. The beds were comfortable and I have never had such good house keeping. The place was sooooo clean and refreshed everyday after house keeping. After being out for 10 hours at a time, it was so nice to come home to a clean room. The only negative was it was expensive in the business centre to use the internet.As for location, we found Universal City to be fine. We loved that we were close to the Citywalk which had a movie theatre, shops and restaurants everywhere. It was really easy after a long day out to go somewhere close by for dinner. As for getting around LA, the hotel is very close to a train station which is only one stop to Hollywood Boulevard. From there we used a tourist hop on hop off bus ($30each for a 24hr ticket - they will bargin) which took us to Beverly Hills, Melrose Ave and Farmers Market. Other than that we used public buses to get to Santa Monica/Venice Beach and West Hollywood. Buses are easy enough to use and are safe. AND yes it is up a big hill!!! I had read this on trip advisor before we went but really come on people lets not be lazy you can walk it and we did. But if you don't like walking there is a shuttle that takes you from the bottom of the hill the Citywalk.Overall I would have no hesitation staying here again."
"Review_11784","hotel_130","hotel_5367","Jul 22, 2008","Solid Hilton Property, Having stayed at Hilton properties worldwide I would say this one rates about average. That's not to say there is anything wrong with it, but it doesn't do anything to stand out from the Hilton crowd.The hotel is well equipped, has a good breakfast and buffet lunch/dinner throughout the day. The gym is small but perfectly adequate and the rooms themselves are nice.Where this hotel could improve is the staffing, every attempt to query or dispute something you are unhappy with is done unprofessinally and in cases makes you feel like you are a liar. For example, I stayed at this hotel twice, the first time I had a rate inclusive of parking, on subsequent stay the hotel tried to charge me for parking. When I raised a query, the manager had a 10 minute disagreement with me before finally picking up the phone to HHonors and finding out he was wrong. Although the problem was resolved, the attitude of the staff and several of the management staff left me unhappy.On a positive note, the concierge team in the Executive lounge are excellent."

There are two great things about this hotel - proximity to Universal Studios and their abundance of good food at their buffet dinners and breakfast on Sunday!The rooms look tired and need updated - including the tvs. The shower had very little pressure and was disappointing. The staff was luke warm with the worst being the check in desk. Room service was actually good with good service and good food.

"Review_11788","hotel_130","hotel_7450","Jul 13, 2008","Don't stay on the Executive Level We recently stayed at the Hilton to be close to Universal Studios. They have a shuttle service that picks up about every 10 minutes to take you to Universal Studios/City Walk which was very nice. The hotel has a nice lobby, but the rooms could just use a little bit of updating. Our first problem was the early check in at 3:00p.m. It did not happen-we had to sit around for 1 hour before our room was ready. This was hard with 3 kids. We were tired and just wanted to relax in our room. The front desk clerks never seemed happy-but the valets were always cheerful.The other problem we had was staying on the Executive Level. Our room and elevator keys never worked, leaving us to have to go to the front desk 6 times to have our room/elevator keys reactivated. Every time we went to the executive lounge, we couldn't get back to our room and would then have to take the elevator down to the lobby to reactivate the keys. Just ask for a room high up, but not executive level and bring your own snacks, muffins and drinks. On a plus side, there's a coffee shop in the lobby that brews Starbucks. Also there's a nice heated pool and jacuzzi outside. We would probably stay at the Hilton again, just not on the exec. level."

Our room faced Universal Studios and gave wonderful views of it day and night as well as a great view of the hills and nearby Burbank. We had a standard room that actually provided ample room, so it did not seem crowded. We had 2 double beds that were very comfortable with high thread count sheets and fluffy down pillows for luxurious sleeping. The entire room was very clean and pleasant. There was even a complimentary welcoming fruit and snack basket awaiting us! There was a nice desk, but we had not use for the high speed internet access, which by the way has a charge per day. There was also a small breakfast table that we utilized well. Our TV was a standard 25 inch, not an updated flat screen, but that was okay. It did its duty. The marble bathroom was spacious and clean with my favorite Crabtree  Evelyn bath and body toiletries. Housekeeping services were great. Room service was also grand and on point. We had no problems with the elevators during our stay and staff was always helpful. The parking charge was not that bad...I think it was like $17 per day. This hotel was everything a 4 star hotel should be. We will definitely stay here again on our next LA visit."

It is a 5 min walk from the hotel. Plus you have the City Walk for restaurants and shopping in the evening.The hotel however is in need of a refurb. The rooms are very big but not the cleanest I have ever seen. At breakfast, I went through 5 cups one morning until I found a reasonably clean one. The breakfast was good though.One thing I didn't like was the unfriendliness of the staff. Throughout our stay there, only one member of staff was friendly and welcoming.Also didn't like the fact that someone left a packet of what looked like an illegal substance in the safe. You'd think they would have checked the safe was empty when the last lot checked out. Just goes to prove that the cleaners weren't as diligent as they should have been.I have no reason to go back there again but guess for the convenience of Universal Studios I would recommend it."

We had an amazing view of Universal Studios and we were upgraded to the executive floor which included a free breakfast every morning for the four of us. The breakfast was great and the staff were excellent. Our room was very clean. We walked over to Universal Citywalk and the Studios all the time, even though we had a rental car. It's not really that far and sometimes we caught the free bus back to the hotel. This was the best hotel that we stayed at during our trip to America."
"Review_11793","hotel_130","hotel_1916","Jun 19, 2008","We like it... Overall, it was a good location esp if you are visiting Universal Studios. We could see the place from our room. And the bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept on! Also, there was a 24hrs Ralphs (supermarket) just 5min away, so that made us happy. Other than that, no complains about the room  the hotel except I do agree that the front desk was slow and not exactly helpful."
"Review_11794","hotel_130","hotel_6918","Jun 8, 2008","Not the best choice We were going to a concert Friday night and had previously stayed at the Sherton Universal and decided this time to try what we expected to be a nicer Hotel. This turned out to be a poor decision, from the beginning the check in process took too long due to the fact that only two employees were working at check in desk and the hotel was quite busy, the next problem was poor communication from the staff, we were initially told that we could take a complimentary shuttle over to the Universal lot , we walked out to take the shuttle and were give three different responses to where and when the shuttle would be there, after waiting for 20 minutes we asked the same person that had told us at check in about the shuttle status and he advised us to walk because he didnt think they where allowing the shuttle up due to amount of traffic; so with 15 minutes to spare we had to start walking down the dark pathway which only has a partial sidewalk so you are basically walking in the lane of traffic (the walk is only about 5 minutes but it is not pedestrian friendly); the television had a poor signal, the ice machine was not working on our executive floor and the elevators are extremely slow. I wont rate it as terrible because the room was nice and clean, however it was not as smooth of a stay as expected and based on the price we paid I think we will skip this Hotel next time around and would suggest the same to others."

"Review_11796","hotel_130","hotel_6400","Jun 5, 2008","Elevators Don't Work!!!! I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE if it was just about the service. The staff was professional to a tee, and really went above and beyond the call of duty.HOWEVER, the problem with this hotel is not the people, it is the absolutely ATROCIOUS standards of upkeep with the essentials of maintanence. During my weeklong stay, I would say there were at least 4 (FOUR!!) during which the elevators did not work properly. There were two days where the elevators did not seem to work at all. No amount of smiling or free breakfast vouchers can make up for the fact that I was late to important consultations with by business partners. It reflected poorly on myself and my reputation in my professional life. I was offered 50% off of my room rate for the last two nights of my stay, but declined. If the hotel did not feel non-working ELEVATORS a sufficient reason for a full comp, I felt it my duty to simply pay and never return again.I have heard from others that not only do the elevators have problems on a frequent basis, but there have been numerous problems with the hot water (OR LACK OF IT!!). I didn't experience any such problems, so I can only go on what I've heard from others who've stayed here in that case.The location is beautiful, the building is beautiful, and the staff are wonderful. But the bottom line remains: The Elevators don't work, and the maintenance staff seems ill-equipped to fix this problem anytime soon. Reserve at your own risk!!!"
"Review_11797","hotel_130","hotel_1300","May 31, 2008","Great location, you must visit! Forgive me if this review is a little long, this is my first time writing a review!Tip number 1!- For airport transfers hire a town car. It is a fixed price and very comfortable. it costs about $95, however the taxi can work out alot more on the meter, especially if you hit traffic!We stayed for 4 nights at the start of May. It was our first time in LA and I must say everything is so far apart, it takes alot of time [and money] to get around. However the location of the Hilton is perfect for Universal Studios (the shuttle picks up from right outside the hotel and drops off right outside city walk). Also Hollywood is quite close.Ok now the hotel is a good standard. When I arrived check in was very quick and there was no waiting around whatsoeverTip 2- It is well worth joining the HHonours reward scheme. You get lots of freebies including quick check in/out and a complementary paper delivered to your door.Our room was on the executive floor, which was about $33 extra per night. May I say it is well worth doing this in my opinion. First of all the executive floors are to the top of the hotel so you have a much nicer view. Secondly, your executive upgrade includes access to the executive lounge. This provides breakfast and afternoon snacks. Breakfast includes every type of cold food you can think of. Afternoon snacks include fruit and a choice of 2 hot snacks. There were things like potato croqets andspring rolls. Although not eneough for a big dinner it definately filled the gap and worth doing for an afternoon snack in between meals. Considering the breakfast downstairs is about $18 each per day it is worth upgrading. Also the people in the executive lounge were so helpful with any queeries we had, its like your own concierge desk.The room quality was good, I understand what people are saying about updating the rooms, they certainly wernt contemporary. However, the Hilton seems to get away with this, as it forms part of the identity of the hotel (just like going to a stately home for example). Bed was huge and view was very nice. Bathroom was well equipped and modern. Everything was very clean. Room service is very good (twice per day).The resturant buffet downstairs was disapointing. This wasnt because of the food. We went to the seafood and lobster buffet which was $38pp. The organisation was not very good at all. By that I mean there were crouds of people, maybee 20 or 30 crouding around the front of the resturant as you come in, not waiting to be seated, just standing around! This ment you are constantly walking round them when trying to get some food. It would have only taken the front of house to have a word with them for them to move, but they seemed happy to let them stay there for about half an hour, seemingly doing nothing! This ruined the dining experience for us and certainly wasnt worth the money. Food quality was good and lots of variety. Warning though, they automatically add 15% grats on to the bill, which I think is a bit cheaky, and I would be inclined to take it off if you have any problems, as you are already paying alot of money. The bill came to $96 and we didnt drink alcohol!General facilities were very good. What I noticed was that the pool area wasnt crouded at all, and seemed most of the time like an exclusive pool. The jaquzzi was very hot though! took me about 10 minutes to get in! There is a quiet area one floor up from the reception, business centre on the entrance to the pool area and gym. All facilities were to a good standard. There is a transport desk, which will help you with any queeries for trips and general transport.If you are visiting LA for the first time, or indeed America like we were it is worth booking this hotel. You'll definately tell the difference between this and a basic 'travelodge' type hotel. Definately book this over the Sharaton, which was $100 extra per night! and looked like a dump compared to the Hilton.Price wise the rooms were $249 per night including TAX for a king exclusive room. Some may think a little pricy, which it is, but worth it if its your first time as you get food included and lots of advice and support to plan your holiday.We had a couple of bad experiences with room service (coming in at 6am without knocking) and people being loud in the middle of the night (the room had a connecting door therefore not very well sound protected from the next room. Therefore we got some extra points added to our account.Any questions please ask!"

And the location is excellent. There is a shuttle bus that runs to City Walk at Universal (which is where the theme park is and then a strip where there are tons of bars, restaurants, cinema etc) very frequently which is complimentary.If you want to do the usual tourist things then a car is not needed if you are staying here as you can use the bus to Universal or the subway station is a short walk away (up and down a very steep hill though!) on which the walk of fame is just one stop away."

Its got a free shuttle bus to it but there is no need as its only a 5mins walk. Hotel is typical Hilton and the price reflects that. Its very big, rooms are clean and big but slightly dated and can be a bit cheesy. Staff are super friendly - from bellboys to reception to car park attendant. I asked the bellboy about prices for the theme park and not only did he go out of his way to find out but he also gave me vouchers for $8 discount off the ticket price. Requested a king bed but when we got up to the room it was 2 twins. Told the reception and they changed it within seconds with no hassle. Only thing to complain is that the parking is a bit expensive, $17 per day for self parking. They also have valet if u pay extra but there is no need as car park is right below hotel and very easy to access urself.Breakfast buffet is good but the expect to pay the usual hotel prices. Bar is good with drinks and big screens to watch sports. All in all enjoyed my stay. Would recommend."

"Review_11808","hotel_130","hotel_1442","Apr 9, 2008","Hilton Universal-Just a few small things.. I stayed at the Hilton on Sunday 3/30 for a single night. I arrived at 3 p.m. which was the check-in time I indicated on the website. The front desk clerk, Marion, was very nice  stated that the room I had reserved was not ready, so she upgraded me. However, looking at the photos on here, it appears that I got the same type of room and bath. I had a king non-smoking room, with a little entry foyer, bathroom with shower/tub combo  a little dressing area off to the side of the tub that was a dressing area with a coffeemaker.The room was very clean. I had a great view overlooking Universal, the freeway and the hills. It was very pretty at nite. I was on the floor with the executive center, and had a wonderful breakfast in the morning of fresh fruit  an english muffin. They also had pastries and cereals. The attendant there was very helpful in printing my Southwest boarding pass for me at no charge. There was also an abundance of soda and water that you could help yourself to.What missed for me was the fact that one of the toiletry bottles was 1/2 full-I think a previous traveler also mentioned running into this. The other thing that was inconvenient was that I had been hanging around the room in my robe, and there was only 1 robe in the closet. I realized I needed something in my car so threw on some clothes  went down to the garage. In that time when I returned to my room the maid had been in to turn down the bed  took my robe! I called down  it took them over a half hour to bring me a new one. The other thing that I did not notice until I went to bathe was that I only had 2 towels. No one had ever refilled the bottom shelf. I don't need a lot of towels, but if there had been 2 of us in the room that wouldn't have been good. I also found the air conditioner unit or blower unit whatever it was to be very noisy and constantly going on and off all nite. It was not condusive to sound sleeping. But, all in all, I thought this was an above average hotel and would definitely stay there again. Parking was pricey. I don't understand why you have to pay to park at a hotel you are staying at in California. There were plenty of empty spaces."

The king bed was so comfortable, even more comfortable than my own bed at home! Everything is clean and well kept. We received a complementary basket several times with fruit, water, and cookies. The bar staff at the pool were really cool and the whirlpool was much appreciated on my tired back. The only problem we encountered was at check-in, the first person we dealt with tried to overcharge me for the king room. We looked at the room first and when we returned to the front desk, we spoke to a different person who gave us the correct rate we booked at. We will be complaining to the hotel directly about that person."
"Review_11810","hotel_130","hotel_9832","Apr 2, 2008","Hit and Miss The Hotel was very close to the LA Metro which was very convinent. But, You have to walk up a HUGE hill to get to the hotel. The hotel offers a shuttle service that goes from the bottom of the hill, to the hotel, and to City Walk. It only runs until 10pm. Kind of a bust....Our A/C never worked. It was sooooo hott at night.

EVERY employee of this hotel that I encountered, including the bellhop, the front desk people, the housekeepers, and even the parking garage attendant had exceptional customer service skills. They must spend an incredible amount of energy educating their staff on how to interact with customers. On top of that, the bedding was very comfortable, the view was beautiful, and they had a very convenient shuttle to Universal Studios. We will definitely use this property the next time we visit."

I informed them I needed two beds and they changed it without complaint and allowed me to check in early. The room was nice and clean. Comfy beds.

"Review_11815","hotel_130","hotel_4809","Mar 10, 2008","Ok Stay My friend and I stayed at the Hilton 3/7 and 3/8 for its convenience to Universal Studios. This is a long one!Let me start off with the positive points:The staff (all that we encountered) were very helpful and friendly. We arrived late (about 12 AM) due to a delayed flight, so there wasn't anyone else checking in...no complaints there, the process was fast and easy. We had room 1767 which had a beautiful view of the mountains, valley and also overlooked Universal City Walk. Beds were comfortable, although the pillows were a bit too poofy for me, but it's all a matter of preference. The shuttle to Universal runs every 15 minutes like clockwork and we (luckily) never had to wait more than 5 minutes for it. Saturday night the 7:30 shuttle was packed (it picks up people at the Sheraton too), so some people had to stand, but it's only about a 5 minute ride (if that long) to the park. There was a 7:45 concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre that night, so I'm sure that had something to do with the full bus. The down side is that the shuttle stops at 10PM, but City Walk night clubs are open until 2 or 2:30 AM. There is a taxi stop at the front of City Walk. They charge $10.00 to go up the hill...pricey, but worth it if you're in heels and/or have had a few drinks!. Otherwise, the hotel is walkable. The negative points were:Bathtub/shower and sink had a very sluggish drain, not totally stopped up, just slow. I thought the plug was down, but it wasn't. The bathtub faucet constantly ran unless you used force to turn the water off. However, when doing that you notice that the fixture is loose (probably from everyone trying to shut off the water!)...was a bit disappointed in this as I'm sure housekeeping would be aware of this and report it. The bar had my liqueur (yay), but only one bottle!! When they ran out (I didn't drink it all...only had two drinks...really!!!), that was it. I would think they would have had another in reserve if the one they had was low. A minor issue though. After a day at Universal, we returned to our room at about 4pm to rest up and get ready for dinner and the concert, but our room was still not made up. We found the housekeeper and she explained that they had to clean the vacant rooms first. We said ok, told her she didn't need to make up our room and just asked for coffee supplies and fresh facecloths  hand towels. Another minor issue. The biggest gripe I have is with the restaurant there. We went downstairs for dinner a little before 6PM. Since there was a long line for the seafood buffet, we decided to dine off the menu. We (mistakenly) thought it would be faster since the buffet food was already prepared and the wait staff only had to do maintenance since everyone was serving themselves. We figured an hour +/- was sufficient to be done with dinner and get the shuttle to the concert (we weren't planning on eating a big meal).We were seated right away (by this time about 6:05) and we each ordered a drink. Then at about 6:10 another waitperson came over and we ordered two shrimp cocktail appetizers and two caesar salads (one chicken and one shrimp), thinking a salad could be prepared pretty quick. At about 6:20 the waitperson came back and that's when I found out there was no more of my liqueur, so I ordered a glass of wine. Drinks (one rum  coke  a glass of wine) arrived around 6:35. Appetizers arrived at about the same time as the salads, approximately 6:45. The chicken and the shrimp were very dry. All in all, extremely dissappointing for a bill that ended up being a little over $80.00!!! Sorry, but I have to continue...next morning before checkout we thought we would try the breakfast...again we avoided the buffet as we're not big eaters and the buffet was $18.00 per person. Ordering off the menu was a bit cheaper....so-o-o-o-o we ordered the 2 eggs with bacon, hasbrowns and toast (simple). I asked for eggs scrambled well. I received runny eggs and burned bacon. My friend received burned bacon and burnt toast. The waiter didn't come right back to see how things were, so we muddled through it, not really enjoying it, but too tired by this point to fuss (probably a mistake). When we ate just about all we could stomach, the waiter finally came back to serve a refill of our coffee and asked how everything was. I said not too good. He immediately said something like oh the bacon wasn't too good was it and that he would get some better bacon...I said don't bother, we're done...but off he ran...came back a little while later with bacon the way it should have been. What irked me is that he obviously seemed to know when he served us that the bacon wasn't acceptable. We didn't even want the new bacon, and didn't eat it. We just asked for the bill. The waiter credited us for the bacon. He was a very friendly person and seemed to want to help us, but maybe a bit overwhelmed?...I'm not sure. Sorry for the long story, but I'm not a picky person, and can tolerate some inconveniences. However, for the price we paid for the room (including tax approx $230.00 per night), and the rather inflated price of the meals, I would expect better quality. If I had to do it again though...I would probably stay there for the mere convenience of it. The hotel itself is very nice. I would just steer clear of the restaurant, and hope for a room with better plumbing!"

Linda was not only efficient and friendly, she came out from behind the counter and walked us towards the elevator, pointing out hotel highlights as we walked.We stayed in a corner room on the 22nd floor. Beautiful view! And the room was very large - I'd guess close to 500 square feet. The bed was a typical newer Hilton bed - very nice! While the furnishings appeared to be a few years old, everything was in great shape. And the fruit basket delivered to our room was nice touch.The concierge lounge is open weekends, which seems to be rare these days. Typical evening snacks and continental breakfast. But it's open all day for that cup of coffee or bottle of water.The location is perfect! Easy access to the freewway and all of L.A. And right next to Universal Studios and Citywalk. A short walk puts you in the middle of lots of shops, restaurants and movie theaters.This was one of the best hotel stays we've had lately. Every hotel employee we encountered greeted us and made us feel welcome. We highly recommend the Universal Hilton!"

Each day we received a welcome basket of fruit and other goodies. What a classy touch! Shuttles were convenient to take to the park and back. The room itself was spotless and quiet. This hotel was rated best by my family as we stayed in 5 different ones throughout our visit to CA."

Someone had been looking through my suitcase and happened to leave a used Hilton pillowcase behind. Complained to security and room manager and I have had no response as to the outcome of their investigation. Handy to Metro - if you stay there eat out and keep your luggage locked. Air con very noisy.Concierge Dora on executive floor was excellent. I wouldn't stay there again."

We were early but shown to a sparkling clean room even though they had been booked solid with a cancelled flight. Free internet service was a plus.We had a day left to tour but check-out was at noon. Our bags were stored in a locked room and even though we had checked out the shuttle brought us back to the airport at 5 PM. This is not a hotel that you would want to spend much time in since the location is industrial with some scary characters around. Between flights and overnight is great!"

It is close to the airport and they have a free shuttle. Check-in was fine. We got to our room and could definitely smell cigarette smoke. It's a Non-smoking hotel...The bedspread had several cigarette burns in it, too. The room was very, very worn and shabby. The bathroom had hair in the tub and sink. I called the front desk and told them and asked to have another room. She said I would need to come down and she would see what she could do. She did get me another room , but the only one was a deluxe room. She didn't charge me for the upgrade. She was very sorry for the problems with the room and would contact security about the smoking.The new room didn't smell like smoke, but did smell. It was a very large, corner room, hence deluxe. The bed was very hard and we could feel the springs. The sheets had holes in them. The room was cleaner, though, so we stayed there. We could not get our money back. Right on the motor way so very noisy.The restaurant was closed, but they would shuttle us to their sister hotel down the street, The Ohana. We decided to drive to a nearby mall and eat at the Ruby Tuesday.One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because the car rental return was within walking distance and it needed to be back early the next morning. We returned it after dinner, though, and that was a wise move.We decided that we should have stayed in a hotel farther away and just left really early! Won't be staying here ever again!"

I had no other choice, but to go to another hotel. I highly suggest you just skip this hotel. There are so many hotels in San Francisco. Why should you go through such a terrible experience."
"Review_11844","hotel_132","hotel_5162","Aug 10, 2008","Terrible Customer Service, Stay Away !!! We booked to stay 2 nights at the Herbert, however, our arrival seemed to prescent problems. When we went to check in for our opening night we were told by a very abrupt and rude girl behind the counter that because people from the previous night wanted to stay longer, that they had no room for us, and we has been tranfered to another hotel. This really not what you want to her after two days worth of driving up from L.A. After discussions with the management (who were also very un-helpfull and rude) we gave in due to tiredness and went to the hotel that they had arranged for us, the Spaulding Hotel on O'Farrell Street. We were transfered here under the arrangement that we had a discounted rate of $99. (later to discover that there actual room rate is under $80, swindled by both hotels !!). To be transfered to this hotel was un-aceptable enough, but trust me you never want to stay in this hotel, and it is an insult that we paid anything for this room (view Spaulding Hotel site for full review of this hotel). However, as we liked the pictures and comments left by previous visitors we thought we would give the Herbert another try and agreed to go back there for our second night in San Francisco. We were told that because we wanted to drop our bags off early in the morning, that the 24-hour receptionist would take our bags and store them for us. However, after waiting nearly 30 minutes at reception for someone to appear, what looked like the hotel manager eventually got fed up waiting for his staff and fianlly stored our bags for us. Once in the room we found it comfortable and clean, and very satisfactory for our stay. However, yet more terrible displays of customer service was to follow. I thought that asking for an iron and ironing board would be a simple request. After being told to come down to reception to collect the items, i was greated by yet another staff member who looked un-happy at the request, because he had to get up and search for the items (while constantly sighing as loud as he could). 10 minutes later he came back with the iron, but no board. When i asked him if i could have an ironing board he responded You want a board as well !!. Followed by another series of sighs, off he stormed to get a board. On the morning of checkout we were greated by another person behind reception who we explained the last two days events to, and as you may imagine, didn't care !!.My recomendation would be that if you are thinking of staying at this hotel, don't bother. There are plenty of hotels on Powell Street that seem better value and will provide miles better service. With both myself and fiancee working in the hotel industry we were shocked with the antics of this hotel, and due to the experience would not visit the city again."

"Review_11846","hotel_132","hotel_3378","Apr 30, 2008","Herbert Hotel - Nice affordable hotel If you're looking for the Ritz this isn't the place to go, but if you're looking for an affordable hotel in a great location then this is perfect. The rooms are small, but clean and cute. The bathroom is pretty tiny, but again it's clean and has everything you need. As people have stated in previous reviews, the front desk is literally just a desk, (and is situated inside a Mexican restaurant - you really have to see it to understand) and apart from checking you in you probably won't have much interaction with the staff. We didn't have any problems, so I can't comment on how other people have been treated when they had an issue. The only thing I would comment on is you have 2 options in as far as the rooms go - an outside facing window, but extremely noisy, or an inside facing window with little fresh air but peace and quiet. We opted for an outside facing window for the air and views, and had to wear ear plugs the street noise was so bad, but that is no fault of the hotel. Internet isn't wireless, but connection is good. The restaurant downstairs is quite good, and it got 100/100 rating from California Environmental Health Board. We had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend it to others."

The location of this hotel might suit some people who want to be in the centre of the city (its on a nosy main street around the corner from Union Square) but we found the noise at night really annoying and it kept us awake. We stayed on the eight floor and our room was tiny! The beds felt smaller than single beds and were not comfortable at all. The room was absolutely freezing and when we phoned the fromt desk to ask how to get the radiator to work we were told that it is on a main timer at the hotel and they could not turn it on for us! The radiator never worked at all for the course of our trip and we were absolutely frozen!

"Review_11855","hotel_133","hotel_7130","Nov 20, 2008","Stay Near The Square - In The Middle Of It All If you are contemplating a trip to see the Golden Gate and also seek basic accommodations with reasonable rates and a great Union Square location, then you need not search any further than the Stratford on the Square 鈥?though, not actually ON the square, it is a half block from it. However, the Stratford is in the middle of everything else: shops, Starbucks and eateries 鈥?oh, yes 鈥?the Powell Street Cable Car literally clangs right past the front door.Another bonus is its easy access to San Francisco鈥檚 wonderful Muni public transportation network (streetcars, underground trolley and bus) system as well as the area BART system, all of it operating from the Powell/Market Street station. The hotel is situated on the eastern side of Powell Street and a two-block uphill walk from the aforementioned station. There is a large sign with vertical lettering of the hotel name above the front entrance. The narrow lobby is non-descript; it consists of a small counter opposite a comfortable-looking sofa. On your left as you stand at the counter is the cramped and slooooow elevator 鈥?I found myself using the adjacent staircase more often than not. In the rear, behind the elevator is a lounge area with television and the requisite computer (for those weak souls unable to breathe without 24/7 internet access.) The Tea Room, where guests have their fill of a light complementary breakfast (bread, muffins, cereal, coffee and juice) can be found on the second floor. Actually, I though it to be a pleasant well-lit room. As you drink your coffee feel free to look down onto busy Powell Street and watch the cable car shuttle tourists up the steep incline towards the oh-so tacky Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf. If you are the type who needs a hearty breakfast to get you going, I don鈥檛 recommend it. (Instead, cross the street and head west a few blocks down Geary to the wonderful Olympic Flame diner, where hungry patrons can choose among 75 types of omelets.)The room, or at least mine, was all I needed for a week. The bathroom with toilet and closet-sized shower are separated by a sliding door; the sink was actually in the room opposite the bed. I won鈥檛 call it small; how about, I just call it comfortable? In any case, who goes to San Francisco to sit in a hotel room? Not I.If you seek glitz, marble, valet parking and a nightly mint, then seek elsewhere; otherwise, the Stratford Near the Square is an enjoyable and wholeheartedly recommended place to rest your head."
"Review_11856","hotel_133","hotel_1957","Nov 9, 2008","Looking forward to next time! I booked a room with a Queen bed and was assigned a 6th floor location upon check-in. It was away from busy Powell Street, much to my relief, and a few steps away from the hotel elevator  stairs - the latter, which I used a lot except when I had my luggage to lug. For this, I used the elevator.The room required a magnetic card for entry. I left it in my room one day so the front desk staff gave me a new one after I provided my ID. They deactivated my original room card, which I subsequently returned to them. I didn't have a room view, which was fine. The white painted wall outside my window actually provided for some privacy. There was light at that side of the building so my room at night wasn't completely dark especially with my curtains slightly drawn.There was no air conditioner but my room had a ceiling fan with light. I turned it (fan) on or off depending on my comfort level. There were two corner lampshade lights attached to the headboard which gave me plenty of light as needed.There was a small cabinet at the corner foot of the bed with hangers, an iron, a small ironing board, and extra blanket stowed at the bottom drawer. On top of the cabinet was the television. Although it had HBO, I mostly turned it on for news and sports.Against the wall was a table and chair. The drawers were useful to put in some of my things as well as the desktop space. There were bottled drinks available but I didn't open any ($4-$5 each if you tamper the seal). I bought bottled water from nearby Walgreens across the street and got ice from the ice machine in the lobby.My bed was nice and comfortable ,which was the centerpiece of the room. The room was small relative to the other SF boutique hotels with queen bed reservation that I've tried before and didn't have any microwave and refrigerator. However, what the room had was adequate for my needs and provided for some degree of coziness and comfort. It was clean and well-kept when I first arrived and whenever I returned at the end of the day.The bathroom had a sink, shower stall, and fresh towels supplied daily. It had a built-in hair dryer as well. There was a small plastic bucket to put in some of your toiletries, which was supplied by travel-size Rusk products (body wash, shampoo, lotion).The tea room (2nd floor) had plenty of sunshine and windows overlooking Powell Street. For breakfast, it had sliced bread, muffins, granola, milk, juice, coffee, hot water, and selection of tea bags. It opened at 7:30 am. During those times when I was up and needed breakfast earlier, I went outside - plenty of breakfast options.There was a lounge area behind the elevators in the lobby. There was the TV, computers with printer, and a rack with a variety of attraction/tourist brochures. I didn't need to use the computer and read that for those who needed to, it required a credit card and charged $5 for 20 min. of usage (I don't remember the extra charge after that time limit) and printing cost $0.25 per page. Note: A one-way cable car fare is $5 without a MUNI passport so where would you rather spend it? :-)Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay at this hotel. It was nice to have 24-hr desk service and its location was ideal for me (access to BART, cable cars, bus lines, Union Square and surrounding areas). Check-in and check-out were convenient and the cost was reasonable. I booked my reservation online and didn't encounter any problems. I will definitely stay in this hotel again in the future. :-)"
"Review_11857","hotel_133","hotel_8965","Oct 26, 2008","Loud Street Noise, No AC We were looking for a hotel in the Union Square area that we could easily reach by BART as we were flying out from the international terminal the next day. This hotel is very close to a BART station. After having had a bad experience at the Palace (very loud street noise, couldn't sleep), I looked for a Union Square hotel review that did not mention street noise. However, the street noise at the Stratford did turn out to be very loud. There was a band playing across the street until 11PM or so. There was no AC in the room and it does sometimes get hot in SF. So you have to open the window to cool down. The windows only open about 4 inches so it is very tough to cool down. The room was very small, but that is to be expected in SF. It was a remodel of a very old building and the age showed through in some places. There was a flat screen TV to make it look more modern, but it was a tiny one. Because of the low price, I did not feel as bad as I did after staying at the Palace. But I'd only recommend this hotel for night owls for nights when cold weather is predicted, or for college kids planning to stay out late, get drunk then pass out. If I stay in that area again, I'd probably stay at the Hilton two blocks away. I avoided that hotel because it was closer to the Tenderloin but there isn't much difference in two blocks, and there are panhandlers between the BART station and this hotel anyway."

We took the BART from the airport and hotel was less than five minute walk. We arrived early and were greeted by a very friendly and accomodating staff. Our bags were stowed until check in time and we headed out. Bus and MUNI are also only a few minute walk away and the trolley runs directly in front of the hotel. Had lunch and returned to hotel. Rooms are very small but comfortable and clean. Similar to accomodations throughout Europe. Walls however are a bit thin and can hear walking over head. We are not light sleepers so this was no problem for us. Would definitely stay at this hotel again. Cannot beat the price and location for downtown San Francisco."

There seemed to be A LOT of bad hotel reviews for San Fran.Reception desk staff very polite and keen to help. Lift very slow, but we were on the 7th floor so persevered with it!Had a twin bed room which was quite spacious although not much room for 2 large suitcases.We we at the front of the hotel so was quite noisy, if i stayed again, which i would, i'd request a room at the back. Slept well despite this.Bathroom spacious and clean. Had a big window which let in lots of light, shower over bath was right next to the large frosted window, bit strange, but on a high floor so wasn't too worried.Breakfast included which was convenient , nothing amazing, but definitely enough to keep you going until lunch.Location - don't think you could get more central. On Powell St in the heart of everything - shops, restaurants, trams etc... Noisy, but its a city. Would certainly recommend."
"Review_11860","hotel_133","hotel_3756","Sep 25, 2008","All I needed The other reviews have it right. The rooms are small and most have only one bed. Make sure you book a family suite if traveling with more than one other CLOSE friend. Most rooms have only a shower, no bathtub, which is fine with me, because I only take showers. My room was immaculate, and stayed that way throughout my stay. Furnishings are simple but the bed was comfortable and everything was in good condition. Only had one trouble - there was a circuit breaker for the bathroom and light over the sink that tended to trip. The front desk clerk told me how to reset it.Desk staff was friendly and helpful and checking in and out was fast and easy. There is an included continental breakfast in a nice tea room on the second floor, but it is minimal. There is bread and toasters, granola and yogurt. There is a nice selection of muffins. They have coffee, tea, milk and two types of fruit juice. I wish they had had fresh fruit. The room filled up fast when they opened at 7:30, but there was more seating by the time I left at a little after 8. If you want an American style breakfast, several restaurants in the area have it.Location was great, two blocks from the Powell St. transit stations, which meant that I got there from SFO on BART in less than 45 minutes for only $5.35. It is steps from Union Square, and less than four blocks from the Moscone Convention Center."

We were not disappointed on either. The hotel is just up the street a few minutes walk from the start of the cable car route to Fishermans Wharf and Union Square is about half a minute walk around the corner. We got BART from the airport ($5.35pp) and walked up Powell Street to the hotel. The young man at reception was most helpful and showed us on maps where the hotel was and pointed out areas to visit. He also said that if we wanted to know anything to come back and ask.The room we had was small as we expected but very clean with a reasonably comfortable bed, a sink in the room and a separate small room with shower and toilet. There was a hairdryer beside the sink and an iron/ironing board in the small wardrobe. Towels were replaced daily. After hiking around all day we didn't notice any noise at night!Continental breakfast was included in the room rate which is unusual for US. This was orange or cranberry juice, yogurt, cereal, toast, muffins and hot drinks and was adequate to keep us going until lunchtime.There were plenty of places to eat around the hotel - we had great Thai food just around the corner in Muang Thai and enjoyed Lori's Diner too. We also had dinner in Jazz Bistro Les Joulins which was lovely and very reasonable with the added extra of live music.The shopping around this area was great too - every type of shop from Gucci and Louis Vuitton to Ross and Marshalls!We would stay here again due to cleanliness, value for money and location, but don't go if you want 5 star luxury and plan to spend lots of time in your room."

"Review_11863","hotel_133","hotel_9708","Sep 5, 2008","Great for tourists... I stayed here for 4 nights during the labour day weekend (Aug - Sep 08). Firstly, the location!!! Perfect for any tourist wanting to be close to all the action and be able to get around town easily. We were able to catch the BART (subway) straight from SFO to Powell station and walk easily with our suitcases to the hotel. In addition, the cable car turnaround on literally 100m away - so it was easily to get to all those tourist attractions (i.e. Fishermans Wharf, Lombard st etc)Although we were initially surprised by the tiny room...we soon made ourselves comfortable. As mentioned by other reviewes..there isnt much floor space for your suitcases however the bedroom and beds were clean - which is important when you just want a place to sleep in at the end of an exhausting day.The complimentary breakfast was a plus. Definitely saved times in the morning wondering around deciding where to eat (and whether anything had opened yet). Although it was quite simple...it was enough to get your day started with toast, muffins, coffee and juice.The only hotel improvements I would recommend are:1) Improve the lift service (it was excruciatingly slow)2) Install air conditioners in the rooms (although our room was quite cool and we never thought twice about needing it)3) Have the sink inside the bathroom as opposed to next to the bed4) Consider having a clearer shower curtain so that you can have some light whilst showering (there were no windows in our bathroom and the only light was in the center of the room)All in all...happy with our stay!"

But when I got the bill it was 159.00 for each night! When I talked to them about it, they laught at me! When I told them I wanted to talk to the mangier, they wouldn鈥檛 let me!Don鈥檛 let this happen to you! But if that doesn鈥檛 sound like a bad price to you, here is the rest.

The lift was very slow and is probably easier to take the stairs. The rooms ARE very small, not much room for your suitcases but as we didn't spend too much time in our room, it wasn't much of a concern. we had a room facing away from the street but could still hear the bells from the street cars. Nothing to keep you awake though. reception was helpful and the cleaning was great. bathroom also very tiny, Breakfast was simple and as most american food full of sugar. stay away from the cereal and stick to the toast. juice also was full of sugar. mufffins were good to take for mid morning snack!We ate at Cafe Mason for dinner, simple pasta and quick service. Also Lori's across the road was a great place for lunch. their chicken noodle salad was good as were their waffles. good value for right in the middle of the city, at the door you can!! take a street car straight to Fishermans Wharf"

"Review_11868","hotel_133","hotel_2162","Jul 16, 2008","Where you want to be As with any location in downtown SF size will be an issue when it comes to accomodations. However, most people don't come here to rough it out in thier hotel room and if they are then they probably shouldn't want to stay in downtown SF. As everyone has reviewed the location can't be beat, you are in the MIX of everything, barely a block away from Union Square. If you want shopping this is it!!! That was the reason for my trip I wanted to do all my X-mas shopping in the city. I think this will become a yearly tradition.I had a room with 2 twin beds so my bf and I just pushed them together to make a semi-full sized bed. There was a little vanity area and closet sufficient for all my shopping bags. It really would not be condusive for more than 2 adults though. Check-in and out was a breeze and they do have computers in the lobby that you can rent if you need to check emails. We parked in one of the many garages in the area, they may have valet but everything is so close you really wouldn't need your car till you leave so a garage will do just fine."
"Review_11869","hotel_133","hotel_3166","Jul 6, 2008","Great location, hard bed, small room Overall the staff and services were pretty good. Expect valet to take about 20 minutes. Also, dont open the door too quickly, you might knock the shower head off the wall. It is really small. My room had a double bed that was really hard. I have to say though it was really clean. The location is great, so pick your poison I guess. Not recommended for children, but for a quick getaway it is good."

The cable car stops right outside the door, there is a great deli just across the street and union square is just around the corner.The hotel itself is just what you need when you are on a break in a city like San Francisco. It is a budget hotel but the rooms are clean and perfectly roomy, breakfast is included in your rate and the front desk is available 24/7. If you want 5 star luxury in a city like San Francisco then you must be planning to spend a lot of time in your room.We were looking for a pleasant hotel to use as a base for our family holiday and thats exactly what we got.We would recommend the hotel to anyone wanting the same and as for the noise of the cable cars, they stop at midnight. And if you want to get some sleep any earlier earplugs are provided. My two teenagers slept in the street facing bedroom and had no problems with noise and they thought the earplugs were just another wacky american notion (thats irish teenagers for you.)"

I loved where the breakfast was served because it is located on the street-side of the hotel with plenty of windows. From a few floors up you can have a great view of the street coming to life in the morning. After you've had your fill you can take a nice cup of coffee along with you out onto the street and walk just a few yards away right into Union Square, where there is always something going on. San Francisco was an awesome experience all around."
"Review_11873","hotel_133","hotel_7771","May 29, 2008","Not so great.. This is an affordable hotel in a wonderful spot. Really right in the center of everything. Unfortunately the hotel itself was not pleasant to stay in. On the first night I was placed near the street where one can hear the constant noise of the trolley car and rambunctious street band. I was then moved to the back of the hotel into a room that smelled like fresh paint. It was nauseating. In addition to the smell the room was freezing. I asked the front desk about the heat situation and they kept telling me it took awhile to heat up. But it never heated up. Usually I feel like I am a flexible person or easy going where it comes to where I sleep but this was not enjoyable. I recommend this for people who will really only use the room for sleeping. I guess in this situation you get what you pay for."

"Review_11877","hotel_133","hotel_6085","Apr 30, 2008","Sufficient and convenient There were three of us in a queen/club queen room for one night last week. My bed was farily comfortable, but seemed a bit narrower than my queen at home. For us three adults, it was a wee bit crowded, but then again, we didn't go to SF to stay in the room. Though very basic, the hotel/room was clean, updated and more than sufficient for a brief stay. The breakfast, which was included, was very basic: mini-muffins, white bread, granola, coffee, milk, tea, and juice. I didn't care for the very slow single lift, which seemed to always re-open the doors at least once after you've already selected your floor or pressed close doors. With our room being on the seventh floor, I definitely got my exercise on the stairs! The location was, to me, the hotel's best feature. Powell St was close to everything (except the water), and the cable cars passed right in front of the hotel, though you had to walk a wee bit to the stop (no problem there). The staff was pleasant and helpful, and we could store our baggage in the backroom for free before we checked in and after we checked out. One more thing-there is absolutely NO AC/central air of any kind, so opening windows was the only way to go because it was absolutely stifling in our room. The bathroom window opened downwards, and even with our room being located on a high floor and with the shower curtain closed, it was still a bit weird to have such an open view into an extremely private room! Powell St was extremely busy and noisy until about 22h, esp with the windows open, but none of us had any trouble falling asleep, probably b/c we were so exhausted from our day's activities. Overall, a pleasant stay at the Stratford."

The room was a bit small but clean and well equipped. Nice shower, a surprising 32鈥?LCD TV, and wireless internet ($30/month or $10/day).Breakfast was ok to get my day going with juice, coffee, bread and muffins.

It is the perfect location since it's very close to MUNI, BART, and cable car stops. There's no denying that the rooms are small, but that's what you're going to get in a smaller, lower-priced hotel in any city. The room was fine for us, though, and the bed was comfortable. The staff was always friendly and helpful, and we had no problem storing our luggage prior to check-in. The continental breakfast was fine, too, but don't expect an extravagant meal. We would absolutely stay here again. If I had one complaint, it would be that the single elevator in the building is extremely slow. If you're in a hurry, be ready to take the stairs."

Read the reviews prior and thus expected a small room. Room was clean. Bathroom almost a big as the room. Bed was comfortable. Location was PRIME! Transportation right outside your door. Plus, if you fly into SF or Oakland airport, you can take the BART to the Powell St station, which is only 2 blocks away for only about $7 round trip and save the money on valeting your car. Staff was very courteous. If you are in town just to shop and party, this is the place for you. If you have kids, you may want to reconsider. Breakfast is a little lacking if you are a morning food person. But, there's a Walgreens a block away and you can buy food there to supplement the bread, muffins, granola, and yogurt. Overall, great price for a great location. A bit small, but not a problem if all you need is a place to crash and shower in the heart of SF."

"Review_11884","hotel_133","hotel_8567","Feb 25, 2008","Very Pleasantly Surprised with Feb 22-24 2008 Stay I needed a moderately priced hotel to stay at while traveling on business and decided to try this one. After reading the reviews (yes, the room was really that small), I was prepared for an average stay. Instead, I was VERY pleasantly surprised. The front desk staff was gracious when I arrived late and was able to accomodate my request for a roll-a-way bed without a problem - and they didn't charge me for it. And while the room had no real view to speak of, it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room was neither too hot (there is a radiator wtih an automatic turn-on valve) or too cold (ceiling fan), and while the cable cars make noise, the noise is not that bad (unless you are staying on the streetfront part of the hotel). The continental breakfast was good for those who are not big breakfast eaters, and there is a Starbuck's across the street from the hotel if you need Starbucks. The hotel is within easy walking distance to Union Square as well as Market Street and the transportation kiosk where you can purchase a 3-day cable car/street car/muni bus pass for $18 - this is a great value as you can take the cable and street cars just about anywhere you want to go. There are a number of very interesting restaurants, shops and jazz clubs in the area, again all within a pleasant walking distance. All in all, my colleague and I were very pleased and enjoyed our stay. I will most definately return again with my husband and child for a weekend stay! And I will make sure to return for the Chinese New Year's parade, as the hotel is 50 paces away from where the parade passes by."

It's clean, no frills, and comfortable, yet pretty close to being run down and outdated (looks like it was built in the 60s or early 70s and was was remodeled in the early 90s). Pros: central location, affordable (we booked a package on Travelocity and the hotel was essentially free, but I wouldn't pay more than $50 a night) quiet, and staff was friendly and helpful. We asked the front desk if they could store our laptops for the day while we went sight-seeing (no safe in the room) which they did and were very accommodating. At the same time, the decor and fixtures are pretty dated and, as others have said, no frills. There is also a charge for internet and parking. (A parking fee I can understand--it's San Francisco, but not offering free internet is usually a deal-breaker for me). All in all I don't feel ripped off but I wouldn't stay here again. I am honestly really surprised by previous reviews that described it as nice. Okay is pretty dead on. Not bad, but nothing special. If you're just looking for an expensive place to crash, you probably won't be disappointed but expect nothing more."

Other than housekeeping, we found the staff to be a bit aloof and not overly willing to ensure we had a pleasant stay. Beware of the Breakfast buffet downstairs where the food is mediocre at best, nothing special. Cost is $15 plus the hostess adds in an automatic 15% tip on the bill (we had a party of 4, not a large group). We didn't realize this as we didn't get the bill until we went up to the front to pay, and already had left her a tip at the table. There's a 24 hr sandwich/donut shop across the street with good coffee. No fridge in the rooms, older t.v. and beddings. The price was good and the room served its purpose for us. A good no frills hotel with a touch of arrogance."

I was skeptical about it because of the reviews on here but to my surprise I found most of them to be wrong. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS HOTEL. We stayed in one of the one bedroom suites, which had an amazing view and tons of room. The carpet looked like it was new and the room was really clean. The suite had two bathrooms in it which was a nice surprise and they looked like they had been remodeled recently. The seating area had a pull out double bed, which was really comfortable for my guests. The room had a very elegant feel to it, with wrap around windows to create an amazing view of the city. The hotel staff was very accommodating. I went down and asked for two more blankets and they brought them back up to the room for me. In the morning I asked if we could have a later check out and they gave us two more hours, without chargeThe lobby of the hotel was really nice and check in and out was a breeze. Parking is extra but only $20 which is amazing for this city. The location of the hotel is really nice also. It is walking distance to Union Square, a $7 cab ride to the Marina. My only complaint is that the walls are thin and you can hear people in other rooms but that is typical of a lot of hotels and something that you just deal with when staying in a hotel. All in all I really enjoy this hotel and it is a steal of a deal when you look at the prices of other hotels around the area. I will without a doubt be staying at this hotel again"

Lots of noise from the hallway and street, even on the eighth floor. The beds were hard and the pillows were hard and flat; I did not sleep well at all. The conference rooms were also in disrepair, but the catered food was good. For the price that I paid ($129.00/night) plus parking, I do not feel that our large conference group got our money鈥檚 worth. I will not be staying at the Cathedral Hill Hotel again unless it is after a major and complete renovation of all of the rooms鈥攊t was a huge disappointment to say the least."
"Review_11911","hotel_134","hotel_6275","Nov 4, 2008","Overall Nice Hotel We needed a room at the last minute, I booked the room, then read the reviews, I was a bit worried, but pleasantly surprised upon arrival. For the price of the room, free parking and a free buffet breakfast for everyone, not just a continental breakfast, a nice bacon, eggs, sausage, potatoes, french toast, danish, cereal, juices, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and more, it ended up being an extremely reasonable rate. The room was not beautifully decorated or freshly painted, but it was clean, big, and had computer access, showtime and a very clean bathroom. We needed help with the heater, a maintenance person was there within minutes to help. Service was excellent and staff was friendly. Basically if you are looking for a nice place to stay for a reasonable rate, this is a nice and clean place stay. The room smelled a little of smoke, but they have asked that no one smoke in the rooms, either they are still trying to get the smell out from past smoking rooms or people smoke in the room anyway. I dont think they want to decorate, paint and put a lot of money into it if they are just going to replace it with a hospital someday, that is what we were told is going to happen."

From check in to housekeeping to gift shop, etc., all employees were courteous, friendly, and helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. Hotel security paid close attention to the safety of its guests, and the help desk quickly and accurately mapped out routes to places I wanted to go.This was my second visit to the hotel. The only down side to my visit was learning Cathedral Hill was going to be replaced by a medical facility sometime next year.While the hotel is my first choice of a place to stay in San Francisco and the people there are nice, not everyone outside it is like that. Just be street smart and you should be fine."

The Lobby looks good with a nice restaurant, salon, gift shop  more  the employees were nice. When you actually enter your room it looks like a damaged dirty motel room that should be located off in the middle of nowhere. The bathroom toilet is the same as a park toilet. The wallpaper was peeling, The room was dirty  even had bug issues. The parking garage had a sewage leak from the hotel  smelled horrible! Do not let the website fool you. Do not stay at this Hotel!"

The hotel is good value for the money, but it is an older hotel that probably needs a renovation. The walls are a bit thing, the furniture, beds, and linens are clean but again a little outdated. There was no free internet and I had to spend $5 for 20 minutes of internet use.The location is good and you are not too far from where you would want to go in SF. There are also many reasonably priced restaurants near-by. Overall, I saved money on an above average hotel stay (7 out of 10)."
"Review_11916","hotel_134","hotel_6696","Oct 25, 2008","Fred Flintstone has a softer bed Very disappointed with the room. First thing I noticed were the three huge stains on the carpet, next wal paper peeling from walls, then torn curtin in the room, and finally the mildew around windows in restaurant (great if you are trying to diet, guaranteed to curb your appetite), The elevator seemed to have a problem stopping on the 3rd floor. Had to wait over 5 minutes for one of the three elevators to stop on the third floor so I could board. I could see it going past the floor without stopping. Was beginning to wonder if I would ever be able to get on the elevator. Not good for disabled people who can't use stairs as a backujp.I have never slept on a bed so hard, my coworker described the bed as a Fred Flintstone bed, only Fred's bed is probably softer. Unfortunately I was there for a day business trip and spent non work related hours in the room. The room lacked adequate furnishings. The only chair in the room was an office chair, not very comfortable for watching the tiny television. Only good thing about the chair is that it could easily be moved close to the small television to see it better. Lack of an adequate chair to relax in forced me to spend 12 to 14 hours on the rock hard bed. The room was stuffy, it had an air conditioning unit, but even with my hand over the vent I could barely feel the air movement. Did not feel safe leaving the window open while I slept as it would have been too easy for anyone to walk along the roof and enter the room through the open window.Even though I was willing to pay for Internet access, the wireless access was not configured as a router, so I was unable to obtain an IP address to get onto the Internet. Hotel staff were unable to help with the situation. This was a critical feature for me as I needed to stay in contact with students enrolled in my online classes. The room service was quick and friendly and the food was good. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was good and reasonably priced, although plan to spend $4.50 for a class of orange juice, service was prompt and friendly."

At that time we were treated very nice and was very understanding. The person at the desk asked that we stay at Cathedral Hill the next time. And because we were treated so kindly and with understanding we were. We arrived at a family member's house and told them what happened. They loaned us the money until we could work things out. Immediately I called Cathedral Hill back. They kindly rebooked the room and stated we could pay cash. On our arrival the next day, we were treated like some one from the tenderloins and asked to stand aside while they help other customers. After we paid cash we were given a room with the wallpaer peeling off, kept awake by our toilets as well as the neighbor's because they sounded like torpeedoes being deployed and there was mold in the shower as well as all over the curtain. We shall never go back and will pay the extra to stay at The Opal as we previously did."

The place is a little dated and appeared to be undergoing a bit of a makeover. No free parking in the large underground car park but it was something like $12 a day which is not that bad in SF and when there is a group of people chipping in.The hotel room was fairly dull and had a bit of a strange smell, sorely in need of decoration and new carpets etc but not dirty. The bathroom was also very dated but bearable. Sliding doors didn't seem to lock properly either. I think some rooms had been refurbed, maybe if you complain they'll upgrade you but we are all fairly laid back and were eager to see the city rather than argue with hotel staff.The pool looked OK but the sun didn't seem to shine out there too often so we didn't bother. Cathedral Hill is a big hotel but only has a small bar/restaurant in the lobby and a small shop and coffee shop.Right across the street is 'Tommys Joynt' which is a good bar/carvery/diner. Open til very late, friendly staff and good value food if you don't want to search for a restaurant plus loads of beers. Opposite is a 50's style diner. Much nicer than IHOP. Hotel is probably about 3 miles from the Fisherman's Wharf area and 15min walk from city centre shopping etc, you can walk (long) or use public transport if not driving.We often walked through the area late at night and although there are some shady characters in the area they gave us no problems at all. I felt safer here than walking past drunk chavs in UK town centres but still, be alert and don't go down any dark alleys...I think Cathedral Hill is a little pricey and you should shop around before staying here. Staff on the whole were ok, not the happiest I've met but they weren't miserable either.If you're not too fussy and not a clean freak you'll probably be ok here, otherwise dig deeper and pay for something better."
"Review_11919","hotel_134","hotel_2500","Sep 30, 2008","Great service, Fair price, Tired rooms. The Cathedral Hill Hotel was significantly less expensive than other hotels in the same area. The service was outstanding, with friendly, efficient staff and a reminder email when our reservation date was near. Online booking was easy and there were no problems with the reservation.We ended up staying in two different rooms because of a very loud pool party that was going on directly below the first room we were given. Management was extremely accommodating about changing our room and even let us check out the new room to be sure it was quiet. The lobby and restaurant areas are very nice, but the rest of the hotel is showing its age, though everything was clean. The floor indicator lights in the elevators didn't work. The first room we were given was in desparate need of at least a new coat of paint to cover all of the scuff marks. The second room looked as though it had been painted more recently, but both rooms had stained carpet, old-looking electrical outlets, and outdated tile and fixtures. The rooms also do not come standard with refrigerators. Rooms with refrigerators are available at an extra charge.While priced about $100 less than the Holiday Inn down the street, the Cathedral Hill was still below expectations for its $124 per night price tag. With some rennovation, it would be a great value. Of course, then they would probably have to charge more, so it may be this is what a reasonably priced motel in downtown San Francisco looks like."

The hotel itself is just an average hotel. No frills or anything. But it was pretty clean which is really the only thing I cared about. Very basic room.Some nice things about this hotel:There is a restaurant, a little shop where you can get basic toiletries and stuff, and a little coffee shop with good coffee and baked goods right inside the hotel, which was very convenient. The staff was helpful and polite.Some not so nice things about this hotel:While it's situated just a short cab ride/bus ride away (or about a 30 min to 1 hour walk) to most of the attractions, the hotel is not in a great neighborhood. There are a ton a homeless people, drug dealers/users in the area. While this didn't really bother me during the day, I didn't feel very safe at night.All in all, pretty good hotel."

We started our holiday in San Francisco and stayed at the Cathedral Hotel located on Van Ness Ave. We found the best deal for San Francisco hotels on LastMinute.com.au. The hotel was clean and comfortable, the staff courteous and friendly. The noise however from busy Van Ness Ave was incessant and intrusive, so if you need something a little more quieter, then you should consider somewhere else or a room towards the back of the property. We were offered such a room on checkin for an extra US$50 a night, which we declined.The Cathedral Hotel is reasonably located, especially if you want to be near Union Square. It was an easy bus ride (or cable car if you wish to walk the 6-7 blocks) down to the Pier 39 and Fishermans wharf area.The hotel has a pool and a fitness area, but there is so much to do and see in San Francisco that we didnt have time to make use of these facilities and we got plenty of exercise walking around. One lesson that we learnt booking our accommodation on the internet and not knowing our way around American airports, is to enquire about shuttle services from the airport to the hotel, before you travel. We made this mistake and consequently spent a lot on taxis, on arriving at each destination. Once at the hotel we were able to organise a shuttle back, a much cheaper option."

Had some concerns about neighborhood from previous customer reviews, but we were out on street as late as 2AM and plenty of people, well lit and eateries available.

They NEVER told us ahead of time that there was a daily fee for parking. Only until the second day did I realize it because not being from a huge city I had no idea they charged 20$ per day for my car including the last day we were there and we checked out at 10am. I mean the parking is in the hotel garage. In the Morning the maids were so loud I was absolutely shocked. The 7th floor ice machine never worked and we had to go to the 6th floor to get ice, The elevator was scary and closed on my fingers at one point and it took so long I mean so long to go up or down. And sometimes it would stop on a random floor and open and then sit there no matter what button you pushed. The pool was FILTHY. And I met 4 different people that had snuck in to use it cause it was a well knownplace to sneak in and swim. I cancelled a movie and was still charged. At one point I called the front and the phone rang and rang and rang. I called back and finally someone answered and she offered NO apology for how long it took. I am so dissapointed. I will never stay there again and neither should you. I say this because months prior we stayed at a dive and I mean dive in the Tenderloin Dist. and it was about the same service and 50$ per night and they did not charge a parking fee for parking in the garage."

Worst points are the lifts (elevators) - rubbish and really slow and wi-fi is not included in rate.The location was ok, we didn't mind walking but there are plenty taxis sitting outside of the hotel.The concierge service was helpful for booking tours.One tip if you do use this hotel: the shuttle service to the airport was really good, the concierge service organised it for us $26 dollars for two which was reasonable and quick,"

I chose the property because it was one of the only choices (combining air  hotel) that had a room with 2 double beds as an option for a good price. Front desk staff were very efficient. We arrived in the early morning and they had us in our room by 11:00am. Our room, on the 5th floor, was just fine. A little dated perhaps, but clean with comfortable mattresses and pillows. No problem with the location as we purchased 3 day MUNI passes and the hotel is on the corner of 2 busy streets (Van Ness and Geary). We took the BART from the airport to the Civic Center and walked the rest of the way (about 13 blocks). The beginning of the California cable car line is close and easy to get on without waiting. We walked to Union Square the first day. Had one dinner at the hotel and it was nicer than expected. Staff throughout this hotel were pleasant and helpful (front desk, bell boy, cleaning staff, waiters) and our checkout took seconds. Took the shuttle back to the airport as it was reasonable. Cathedral Hill Hotel delivered as a good budget choice. (I have stayed in the tiny rooms around Union Square on previous trips.) Shopping in SF is fabulous and I would rather spend my money that way!

We spent the whole day away from the hotel, and after a wonderful meal at Scomer's on Fisherman's Wharf, when we got back we decided to end the evening with an Irish coffee. It was 10:45pm and the first thing we were told was to hurry up with our order because they were closing at 11pm. The Irish coffe was bitter, cold, and I'm certain they forgot the liqor. The night was punctuated with noise, and at one point at around 4 am some errant person was shouting profanities right outside our door, leading my wife not being able to sleep for the rest of the night.

The rooms are clean and extremely spacious. Our room had 2 queens, plus a living room area. It was overly large for a hotel room. Linens, etc... all great. The location is good, about a 15 minute walk to Union Square. We booked 2 rooms, 1 for us, and one our 2 kids, ages 20 and 22. If you're looking for 5 star, this is not the place for you. But don't let that deter you. Overall, we were actually surprised how satisfied we were, since the price was quite low. The rooms exceded our expectations. Can't go wrong with this hotel ! We definately recommend it."
"Review_11947","hotel_134","hotel_1445","Aug 1, 2008","Truly Awful Experience Had been looking forward to my time in San Francisco following 4 weeks in New Zealand. Sadly my expectations were severely let down. Following a 25 hour trip from my hotel in Christchurch (NZ) to Cathedral Hill I was greeted by a surly receptionist. I may have blinked when he smiled, certainly an unwelcoming check in experience.On entry to my room i was greeted with a bottle of wine from a friend who'd contacted the hotel prior to my arrival, a very nice thought, however was slightly tarnished when the bottle which was chilled on ice with glasses had not been privided with a corkscrew!!My room, like the rest of the building felt out of place for 2008, run down and shabby. An old a/c unit that could be hard to switch on for those guests who may have problems with gripping things. The shower had no proper mixing ability so it was hit or miss whether you had a scalding or freezing shower. There was no form of sound proofing and the room was loud 24 hrs a day, not condusive for relaxing. The concierge's inabillity to help or actually organise anything is truly astounding. Everything I learnt came through experiencing it for myself or through taxi drivers and local bar or restarauntuers. One prime example was being bundled into a limo to a shopping centre a couple of blocks short from Fermans Wharf. This journey was assured to be the same price as a taxi, yet was $17 as apposed to the $12 it costs from the hotel to the wharf.The ability of the staff is not the highest, a prime example occured when trying to change some sterling travellers cheques, the receptionist did not understand until i explained that sterling is Great British Pounds and therefore required an exchange rate. They were only able to offer an exhange rate that was over a week old. Another example was when enquiring about wireless internet I was advised the process. when i pointed out that giving your credit card details over an unsecure network was ridiculous and risky i was greeted with a blaze attitude. Since my return to the UK I have seen other reviews of this hotel that draw attention to my biggest concern, the location of the hotel. Cathedral Hill is on the corner of Van Ness  Geary. The location felt intimidating and seedy, several adult shops and massage parlours within an extremely short walk from the front door. There are also a large ammount of beggars in the area some of whom are agressive or intoxicated. I did not sample the bar or restaraunt because i felt less than inclined to give this hotel any more of the money I'd already paid to stay there, however was glad of the hotel's proximity to Mel's diner, a true american diner with great food  service.I would not recomend this hotel in the slightest and would expect more for the price and rating. Highly dissapointing experience and not a great way to sample San Francisco"

We just thought we should write to let others know that we enjoyed our stay more than any time in recent memory thanks to the outstanding service we received.The professionalism that staff posed from the first day was beyond excellent customer service. The first contact was with the gentlemen that assisted with the luggage. These gentlemen were very helpful with maps and directions around the city throughout our stay. The lobby was clean and very receiving. The rooms were clean and housekeeping was very adaptable to our needs. The pool and Japan area was immaculate and inviting. We had the opportunity to enjoy your dining area of the Jack Tar Restaurant. We arrived 15 minutes prior to closing and ther staff treated us with the upmost courtesy. We did not feel rushed they were very courteous and professional. The food was excellent. We ordered the clam chowder which was the most delicious that we have ever tasted. We must recommend it to anyone who visits the area. The presentation of the soup was wonderful we really enjoyed the Laughlin soup bowl. As we write we would like to know where to purchase them. We have been searching on the internet since my arrival. The hotel was in walking distance of many of the cities attractions. There was a bus stop located in front of the Cathedral Hotel that would take you to the warf and North BeachOur stay was the most pleasant and we will let our friends and family know of how well we were treated while staying at your establishment. I would like to commend the management for choosing such a wonderful staff to employee. Thank you for providing us with a wonderful experience. Rest assured, we will be back again."

In fact, we spent our son's 4 year birthday at the Cathedral Hill because he loves it so much. Check-in is quick and painless. Balconies are hard to get but other requests are usually granted without problem. The rooms can be spacious and are reasonably priced. The beds have always been firm and comfortable. The bathrooms are clean and the towels are plush. The location is great because you are right in the middle of everything and can get to many of the tourist attractions by bus or even just walking. The pool and patio are excellent. The pool is heated and a great size for anyone with small children. The patio is spacious and has lots of places to sit from picnic tables to grass and all the lounge chairs in between. The room service is very nice. The menu is not large but so far everything we have ordered is delicious and delivered timely and at the correct temperature. We love this hotel and consider it our home away from home (especially with gas prices going through the roof)."

"Review_11957","hotel_134","hotel_3668","Jul 1, 2008","Pricey and could be better Just returned from San Francisco where we spent (4 of us) 5 nts at the Cathedral Hill Hotel. I had read some negative reviews before leaving and was very nervous about staying here. As previously pointed out it is a very large hotel and the area is most definitely awful, the only complaints we really had in our family room was that there were only ever enough towels left out for 2 people. Also we were unable to open the window. On the plus side the beds were very comfortable and the room was big enough for us. We had also stayed in LA the week previously and compared to that we found CHH overpriced for what we got. The pool area was nice, though we didn't actually get to use it which was another bone of contention, as we arrived back early on our final full day in order to have a swim and relax only to find there was a private pool party and we could not be admitted. I do feel guests should have been advised of this in advance. Not the sort of hotel you would pick if you want a quiet hotel either as it was very noisy, there was something going on every evening but we didn't mind that, there's plenty to look at, you may even bump into Elton John!! As someone previously recommended, 'Tommys Joynt' across the street was a big hit , not everybodys cup of tea but it definitely worked for us."
"Review_11958","hotel_134","hotel_5042","Jun 30, 2008","Best deal in town! After reading other reviews I was concerned when I booked 5 days at Cathedral Hill Hotel. The main reasons I booked there was the incredible low price, which included free parking and a great free breakfast buffet. Also, the hotel was close to all major attractions. Upon arriving I thought I'd see Cecil B Demile filming an old movie. The lobby was right out of old Hollywood, and I took a 'Gloria Swanson' picture of my wife cascading down the huge staircase, ready for her 'closeup'. It was a lot of fun. I believe the rooms have been recently updated because ours was very nice and showed no signs of wear and tear at all. The shower was awesome with great water pressure and unlimited hot water. The room also had wireless internet available. The help was amazingly friendly. Overall. a terrific experience and if I ever go to San Franciso again I will most definitely stay there."

Overall it was ok but its position is not ideal as some of the streets surrounding are rather suspect and you wouldn't want to walk round the area after dark. The main problem we had was with the barman. Despite the information in our room, the hotel bar does not open after 11pm. We rate this as fairly pathetic for hotel guests and complained to reception the following day (in room info quotes 1am). We were told that the bar closes if no customers are there. However as there was a tour group of about 20 people it should have stayed open. The following evening (our last) we wanted a farewell drink with our fellow travellers but again the barman refused to serve us after 10.45. His arrogant reply was that our name was not on his pay check! Excuse me, as the customer I expect I am his employer! They obviously don't understand the saying that 'customer is always correct' in the US. Obviously we didn't leave any tips and we would advise anyone in a similar situation to buy your own bottles and sit on the patio  serve yourself...Also the reception ladies toilets are fairly grotty!"

There were not really sufficient towels and the flush on the loo was *very* suspect!The computer gave 60 mins for $8 and it loaded quickly which was good.The pool was lovely and tranquil, set in nice gardens but no-one from the hotel around.I like a swim every day and when I went I felt intimidated with a large group of young people doing somersaults, back flips etc and taking over the whole pool.Their language was dreadful and they spent much time loudly discussing which drugs to take to the evening's party!Whilst this is not obviously the fault of the hotel I felt that a person seen to be about might have made it nicer for others.Once this group moved on then it was fine and everyone else felt able to return to the pool.There's not really enough sun loungers and the pool towels are small and rather threadbare.This hotel is a long walk from anywhere particular and the cable cars etc are also not nearby.I would definitely avoid it if I went back to SF and would most definitely stay on the Wharf.Mel's Diner over the road was quite nice, we daren't walk too far in this area looking for an alternative!"

We saw several negative reviews of the hotel before our trip and were greatly relieved to have a good experience at the hotel. From the moment we checked in until we checked out we found every staff member to be friendly and helpful, something that isn't always the case at much more expensive places. We had a king room which was clean and comfortable. The carpets could stand to be updated but the bed was brand new. At such a low rate, the hotel can't be beat. Some tips if you're going to San Francisco--there is a bus stop in front of the hotel and we bought a 7-day bus pass in the hotel gift shop. Staff was very helpful with directions and suggestions. The concierge arranged tours for us and suggested restaurants within walking distance. There's a great place, Mel's Drive-in across from the hotel which is fun and offers good food. Also a good Japanese restaurant a block away. The hotel has an ATM in the lobby and a restaurant plus a take-out coffee shop."

"Review_11965","hotel_134","hotel_8255","May 9, 2008","Cheap rack rates, spacious, stingey, does the job The rack rates (about $119) are as good as discounted hotwire or similar rates in other hotels in SF. You can stay at a lot nicer places for the same money if you use a discount booker like hotwire. BUT - that's not always an option, plus it's nice to know in advance where you are staying. So their rates are pretty fine for SF if you don't have the time or inclination to go searching hard.The rooms are spacious and fine. Nothing special. The usual - TV, bathroom with tub, desk, large - VERY firm bed.The location is superb - better than in the main shopping/cable car area in my opinion. We stayed off Taylor / O'Farrel the previous few days, and whilst it's near the cable cars, Van Ness in our opinion is far better located (the cable cars are next to useless - too long a wait). Van Ness runs right down to the Fisherman's Wharf and there are cheap ($1.5) busses running all the time. It;s not a bad walk either - especially the downhill direction :-) - It;s also a 10 minute walk back to the main shopping district on Market St.Also a short bus or walk to the Cow Hollow area for superb restaurants and shopping - very upscale.My major gripe with the Cathedral Hill Hotel is their mean / stingey streak. They really need to get up to date with charges. The extras they charge for and should not do:$12 a day for Internet access (no free hotspots in range) - this should be FREE everywhere now, and mainly is.Room service - Mandetory 15% tip plus $2 extra. This wouldn't be so bad if their menu was not so mean. For example - if you order their burger you pay Extra for onions!!! Extra for cheeese, Extra for pepper - Extra for anything. I mean, come on, paying for onions on a burger.This just reinforces the old reputation hotels had for stitching you up the moment you stepped foot inside. Needless to say we have paid for nothing - ordering food in from outside etc.A small but important thing they need to change. Make the guests feel welcome and inclined to spend money, don't force every cent out of them"

Breakfast was included and the buffet was a complete American breakfast. The room was quiet. Although the room wasn't the largest we have had it was more than adequate in size.In addition the hotel is within easy walking distance of a number of interesting and excellent restaurants, from Persian to steak.You can pay many times more for a room in San Francisco and not have anything comparable.

"Review_11974","hotel_134","hotel_6300","Feb 11, 2008","Never again My family and I stayed at this hotel which is owned by California Pacific Medical Center and the American Cancer Society when a relative had a kidney transplant. The reservations agent was less than hospitable when I booked, but that could be overlooked if the guest room wasn't shockingly filthy. The first room we were assigned had food reminents and dirt on the walls and the bathroom floor is one I would never walk on without shoes and would rather not walk on with shoes. We asked to switch rooms. The second room had less dirt on the walls but there was scummy dirt on the hair dryer and once again a frightening floor in the bathroom. The website says the rooms have been renovated but a new bed spread, chair, and cutains is not the place to start. The carpet needed to be replaced, there was a brown mystery substance on one of the curtains, an exposed electric socket, the wallpaper is hanging and there was rust all over the bathroom-including a rusted mirror that is bolted to the counter and has seen God knows what in terms of use. I would not recommend this hotel until they actually renovate it. The location was good and the package rate ($89 which included parking, and breakfast buffet) would have been good if I wasn't waiting to catch something from the room. It's appalling to me that a hospital and a nonprofit could allow such filth. I also noticed that comments have been left about the ac units not working back in October 2007-there still not fixed! Stay somewhere else even if it costs more. One more thing-the shuttle to Cal Pacific does not run on weekends and nobody informed the family of this. In fact, the reservations person gave me the times for it and didn't bother to mention that it doesn' t run on the weekends. A couple of family members were waiting for it to come Sat morning. It's @ $7 cab ride to the hospital."

Hotel needs a few little tweaks (carpets a little dirty, toilet flusher malfunctioned frequently) but the service more than compensates for these few inconveniences.

This is a wonderful hotel in a great location. We had a lovely room, a bit small, but extremely comfortable with all of the amenities....even l'Occitane products in the bathroom. Nice comfy bed with crisp white down duvet.....very much appreciated after cross-country flight, then lots of walking in fun San Francisco. We faced the courtyard so the room was very quiet. Even the hallways, elevators,  public spaces were spotlessly clean  everything smelled so fresh. (After all, it is in a city!) Only negative was the snooty restaurant, but there are lots of dining options nearby....Mel's Diner for breakfast and Annabelle's for late nite dinner. And if you can't find something to eat in foodie heaven (aka San Francisco) there's something wrong with you! The parking was expensive  we agreed that you really don't need a car there. Definitely would return. And the price was the best part......$195 a night. Most city hotels there are double that!"

A meal in the resaurant is a must and the breakfasts are good, but expensive. Lovely quiet room at the back, no view to speak of but didn't need it as the hotels central location means that more time is spent outside the room than inside! Could not fault this hotel, a perfect place to start a holiday in California."
"Review_11986","hotel_135","hotel_3642","Sep 30, 2008","a great spot We got a great deal via Expedia and had a suite up on the 9th floor. The rooms were lovely and spacious and the bathroom (especially the bath/tub) was really nice.Minutes away from all the shopping and central sites we will definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in San Fran. The staff at the desk were always pleasant and helpful and advised us on tours and helped with the bookings, and the doorman always had a smile and greeted you like an old friend."
"Review_11987","hotel_135","hotel_8243","Sep 20, 2008","Nice Hotel, Good Location My partner and I stayed at the Palomar over a long weekend while visiting friends in SF. I had never stayed there before, but knew of the hotel from previously living in SF. I received a great package deal price that included parking. (Booked through Kimpton's website directly.) For the level of hotel, it was the least expensive parking package I could find at comparable hotels in the city. It was a good deal.The staff was very friendly, helpful, and the accommodations very nice. I would recommend this hotel. Be sure to request a high floor, because of street noise. We were on the 8th floor and this was not an issue. The staff at checkout had some issues with our bill and charged an incorrect amount. Be sure to check your bill. However, this was just a mistake by a new staff person. It happens. Given the price and location, I would stay here again and recommend the Palomar. You have easy access to MUNI, BART, and Union Square."

Bathrooms are small, like very small. They provide scrace L'Occitane shampoo and soap. Strangely, shower gel is NOT available. As I asked, I learnt that they did not have shower gel.Bar is a joke. The restaurant is turned into a bar, and you sit around tables.Breakfast is not very good and pricey.Concierge is more like students, whereas 2 years ago they turned up with really good suggestions. They have no SF insights. One morning, I asked for the best steakhouse in town. Back in the evening, no news, so I called, and they had obviously forgotten all about my request. After a while, they gave me an adress, where I had absolutely no reservation whatsoever. Harris' on Van Ness dealt with the issue in the most professionnal way. Another request was met with blank stares.Valet parking is still available. They do not bring your car up any more. You must go down to the garage, and wait for the guy to bring your car. Sometime the attendant is there. Sometime he is not, and you must call the font desk to get the attendant. Most inconvenient.It is still very conveniently located, and we like the room. Other than that, well, look for packages !"
"Review_11989","hotel_135","hotel_3420","Aug 26, 2008","Would stay here again! I enjoyed staying at the Hotel Palomar, and thought the location was great for the touristy part of SF. Half a block to the BART and Muni, which made travel to other neighborhoods and the airport easy, and short walk to Union Sqaure, Yerba Buena gardens, lots of shopping, etc. Staff at check-in were helpful, and the room was nicely decorated, very clean, and quiet as it was on the top floor overlooking the courtyard. Bathroom was nice, though the sliding door was a little weird (as opposed to a normal door leading to a bathroom), and I LOVED the l'Occitane bath products. As others have mentioned, it's a nice touch to have the wine tasting daily from 5-6, though we also never made it because we were out all day. I really enjoyed the Palomar, and would definitely stay there again if I got a decent rate."
"Review_11990","hotel_135","hotel_8698","Aug 25, 2008","Hotel Palomar - Absolutely Awesome! We stayed here for a short weekend trip, and would definately stay here again for a longer trip next time. It was our first time staying at the Hotel Palomar or at any Kimpton Hotel. We decided on this hotel because it was pet friendly and we had our two dogs with us for the weekend. We booked our room through the hotel's reservations directly because they were able to give us a better deal than all the other travel websites. Would highly recommend that you contact the hotel and see what their best available prices are before you book your rooms via Expedia or Orbitz, etc. The minute we pulled up to the front, we were instantly greeted and helped out. They also greeted our puppies which made us felt very welcomed. When we were checking in, the people at the front desk even gave our pups doggie treats. We had heard great things of a Thai restaurant but we couldn't remember the name exactly so we asked the gentlemen that was helping us with the check-in. He instantly looked up the name of the restaurant for us, and even helped us make reservations for the night! The location of the hotel makes going everywhere super convenient too....it's right in the heart of downtown, Union Square. We had a car with us so we had it valeted for the weekend. The hotel parks the car in their indoor parking lot located downstairs of the hotel, which is great because we didn't have to worry about the car being in an outdoor lot. Oh, and did I mention the complimentary wine hour!?!! The hotel hosts a complimentary wine hour where they introduce a red wine and white wine for their guests to try! Our overall experience was just absolutely awesome. The hotel is super accommodating, the staff were all very professional, and friendly. LOVED IT! Highly recommend it, hands down."

The big problem we had here was the michelin star restaurant, located on the 5th floor. The food was lovely but our table was situated near the air conditioning vent and it was absolutely freezing. Three times we asked for the air conditioning to be turned down before the manager eventually came to our table and told us they were aware of the problem but they were unable to do anything about it. I pointed out to him that three people in the table behind us were actually wearing their jackets and he agreed it was not a satisfactory situation. Our tea and coffee was on the house but considering we had paid $500 for the meal I felt this the least that could have been done."
"Review_11993","hotel_135","hotel_7929","Jul 29, 2008","Lovely - Great value - Some communication issues Great rate on Travelzoo.com - $139.00 for two doubles. Nick-Dal thought room was small, but perhaps has never stayed in a NYC 85 sf shoebox boutique hotel for $350 ... our Palomar room was HUGE! Well appointed, comfortable (except for the pillows; I dislike down, and the foam pillows that were brought up were hard as rocks). Staff was very friendly, but it took forever for them to bring our bags to the room. (Three calls to the desk and one personal trip to look for them; apparently there was one bellman on duty and couldn't deal with several people checking in at once ... we were late for an appointment because of that. When he finally did deliver the bags he said there would be a bottle of wine delivered to our room for our trouble, but the wine never materialized.) Towels were not changed daily, which didn't bother me, but it did bother my travel companion (there was no note in the bathroom indicating that towels would not be changed, as I've seen in other hotels). Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, so can't comment on that. Annabelle's Bistro just down the block had one of the best Ceasar Salads that I've ever tasted. Hotel offers a free wine tasting daily from 5-6, which is a lovely idea, but we were out sightseeing all day, and never in our hotel at that hour. Would have been a nice end to the day at 9 pm or so. Overall, good experience at the Palomar. Very clean, comfortable, friendly and quiet."
"Review_11994","hotel_135","hotel_10337","Jul 28, 2008","No closet, no service On busy Market Street, the hotel sits above an Old Navy retail store. The layout is a little odd with the main hotel starting on the 5th floor. The restaurant and bar offer very limited hours, and otherwise are dead space off the elevator. The room was on the small side as expected in San Francisco. But for the price I did not expect no closet (no hooks, no rod, no alcove, nothing ... NO closet). Service was non existant. Our request for towels not only resulted in no towels, but resulted in an unpleasant attitude from the front desk staff. I travel a great deal for work and spend about 200 nights a year in hotels. This was by far the worst ever."
"Review_11995","hotel_135","hotel_1286","Jul 25, 2008","Excellent Hotel and Location This Hotel is situated at the perfect location right in the heart of downtown San Francisco. You are 2 blocks to Union Square, 1/2 a block to BART, 6 blocks to China Town, 2 blocks to the famous Cable Cars.The hotel is decorated nicely, very clean and the service is quick and efficient. Our check in took about 2 minutes and we were upgraded to a huge room overlooking market street. We were concerned about the street noise, but it was very quiet and a great place to people watch out the windows.The room had a large, King bed with bench in front, a seating area with table to the side and another seating area by the bedside. It had a huge flatscreen tv on the wall with DVD player and pay movies. It also had HBO.The bathroom was very spacious with lots of granite counter space and was very clean. There was a large closet in the room with ironing board and plenty of storage.We used the fitness room in the hotel, which was very small and a bit crowded when 2 other people came into it. It was convenient though, because most hotels in the area make you go to outside locations to excercise, which is really a hassle.My only small complaint was the lack of comfort from the pillows. They were very soft and mushy and made sleeping a bit difficult. After mentioning this in an online survey from Kimpton Hotels, the manager replied right away and apologized for the pillows and said to contact him next time I was coming to town and he'd upgrade my room. I thought that was excellent service."

The room has a desk, bed, flat screen t.v. and an updated bathroom. I did not use the restaurant, or fitness center so I can not comment on those. There was free wireless internet, which was a great perk. I slept well and did not hear any street noise. I would stay here again if I was in the area. Of of course I was here for business and received a rate of $199/night, which was less than half of what they normally charge. But I think $400 is the going rate for 4 stars in the area."

The Hotel Palomar is a gem in the heart of San Francisco's downtown district, boasting a level of service that blew us away. They took care of our every need, even printing out our airline boarding passes for us upon our check-out. The hotel is spotless, and the Fifth Floor restaurant was an excellent choice for breakfast. Truly, it's hard to come up with superlatives that adequately express how impressed I am with the Palomar. I'll definitely be seeking out other Kimpton hotels in the future."
"Review_12006","hotel_135","hotel_7969","Jun 8, 2008","Super Spot I stayed here for 5 nights on business. The location was absolutely superb. I took the BART in from the airport and it was barely 5 mins walk which is easy these days with with suitcase you can pull behind you. I also took the BART back when i left. Its so easy and just $5. The room was furnished in traditional old style but was warm and welcoming. There was plenty of space and a good desk which was important for me. The internet access was excellent and free. The bathroom was a little dated but it worked fine and the L'occitane products never fail to help.They didn't have tea making facilities and it took 3 goes to get a kettle up to the room. I guess my Spanish is useless. Other than that the room was great. No noise to speak of even though its in a busy location. The breakfast was in a meeting room as they were refurbishing the main hotel restaurant and bar which was a shame. it was average but they had fresh fruit which is always great. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel had a general impression of being tailored for business/tourists. The location was great for getting around. The Apple store was just across the road and Union Square a stones throw. I didn't have any room service but there is a great little french bistro 5 doors down on the right which i recommend highly. i ate there twice on my own and really enjoyed the food. also another block down on the right is a good cafe serving breakfast and nice juices for a quick start.I'd stay there again as was good value, good location and overall a tidy place."
"Review_12007","hotel_135","hotel_4343","Jun 8, 2008","Just o.k. We are frequent guests of Kimptom hotels. We were a little disappointed in this one. I guess we are spoiled because this was the first one which did not upgrade our room. Perhaps there was no availability. The room was fine but we had requested a quiet room on a higher floor. We got a room next to the ice machine on a lower floor. Unfortunately, we did not notice the ice maker until we were unpacked and too tired to move. That was a big mistake because there was a party down the hall at 10 p.m. and there were many visits to the ice machine! Since we belong to their club, we were greatly disappointed and will not stay at this Kimpton again.I have to give Lauren at the front desk kudos, though. She went out of her way to make last-minute dinner reservations for us."

I definitely plan to return someday!"

We had booked one of the inward facing rooms as we wanted to be sure of a quiet room but on reaching the room we found we had been put into a disabled room which actually overlooked the Apple store. We returned to reception and we were moved without any issues to a room on floor 8 which overlooked the zen garden.The room was lovely - we did have robes hanging in the wardrobe as well as some underwear that you could buy (which I thought was a bit odd). We appreciated the free glass of wine in reception and although the check out time was 12noon, we asked for a later 1pm check-out and this was no problem at all.I was very impressed with this hotel - the location, price and comfort of the room certainly made it the best we have stayed at during any of our trips to San Francisco."

Hotel staff goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Our room was an executive king on the 9th floor; which was a comfortable size. The property was always quiet, thus making it ideal for uninterupted slumber. Every evening we returned to find our bed turned down and soft jazz playing on the radio. This made for a great prelude to winding down from a busy day sightseeing. As a previous guest stated...the hotel left nothing to be desired. Would most definately stay at the Palomar again.

We paid $233 per night excluding taxes and parking, which ultimately put us at $300 per night. The rooms were fine, except for the tiny bathrooms that had you brushing up against the toilet to enter the tub. The biggest complaints I have are that continental breakfast isn't included and the lobby is so small that their wine tasting from 5-6 lacks any type of atmosphere to make it worth the while. If you could get a much cheaper room than what we paid, it's probably worth it. But at this price, skip it."
"Review_12017","hotel_135","hotel_9554","Mar 23, 2008","Excellent choice I had to come to San Francisco for a conference at the Marriott downtown. Because I prefer to stay in smaller hotels, I booked the Palomar which is right across the street from the Marriott. I couldn't have been happier with the experience. The staff was welcoming and very helpful, the room was spacious and comfortable. My first night they sent a plate of fresh fruit to my room. And the price was only $10 more than what I would have paid at the Marriott. The hotel is just two blocks from the SF MOMA and at a public transportation nexus (BART, tram, cable cars).My only complaint is that eating in the hotel is quite expensive ($6 Rice Crispies). So I ate out the entire time. For cheap eats to go, I recommend the Alexandria Cafe or the Coffee Bean around the corner one way on Market. Or the Westfield Mall food court around the corner on Market the other way. It sounds cheesy to eat in a mall food court, but this is a very upscale mall and the food was excellent and a full meal could be had for around $10. The King of Thai Noodles on the opposite side of the block from the hotel is also excellent and reasonably priced.I will stay here every time I come to San Francisco from now on."

Amazing, beautiful, and very comfortable. We had a free upgrade to an executive suite which was great. The staff was super friendly. You order towels; housekeeping would be there in 3 minutes. You also have a dvd\cd player in the room which was very convenient if you want to lie back in your room and watch your favorite movie.

"Review_12020","hotel_135","hotel_6593","Jan 3, 2008","Wonderful stay We stayed at the Hotel Palomar, with our two dogs, for one week. The hotel is decorated in an art deco style with modern touches. It isn't fancy or super luxurious, but it is very stylish and nicely appointed.The best part of our stay here and why we choose Kimpton Hotels when possible is because of the staff. Kimpton has the best trained, most friendly and accomodating staff with service on par or better than the some of the finest hotels in the world. From the doormen, valets, housekeepers to the check-in staff, everyone was incredibly gracious. My sister pre-arranged a transfer to the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental Hotel (we were in town for a family wedding there) and she said they wished they could move back to The Palomar.My only complaint was that getting to the hotel through the traffic and huge throngs of pedestrians made our ingress and egress challenging, however, the hotel is located in a very popular, vibrant location, so I guess it should be expected. Also, my sister had an interior room and I would suggest requesting an exterior room so you have a view."
"Review_12021","hotel_136","hotel_6484","Dec 16, 2008","A great little gem for a fantastic price. Every December I meet friends for a girls' weekend in San Francisco. We usually get rooms on Priceline, but this year decided that location took precedence and looked for a good rate on a hotel near Union Square. We found a wonderful rate through hotels.com for the Serrano Hotel, which is a Kimpton property. Knowing Kimpton's reputation and noting the fantastic location we decided to give the hotel a try and are we glad we did!Some reviews here suggest that the area is too criminal or threatening, esp. for women traveling by themselves, but we came and went after dark and never once felt threatened or afraid. We weren't even nervous. The Hilton and Nikko hotel are right around the corner and walking to and from Union Square along O'farrell is absolutely fine. Yes, you might be asked for change by someone along the way, but that can happen on almost any street downtown.The hotel itself was an easy walk from the BART station on Powell. The lobby is very cute and the decor for Christmas cheery. At the front desk, play a hand of blackjack with the clerk and if you win, you pick from a list of daily prizes (we got a bottle of wine delivered to the room). If you lose, donate to their animal charity. Check-in was fast. The elevators are tiny and on the slow side, but not annoyingly so. We had rooms with two doubles. The rooms are very small, but nicely decorated. Love the ipod docking alarm clock/radio, the down comforters and comfy beds. The flat panel TV was a nice touch also. The closet had ample room with iron/ironing board, plenty of hangers and cheetah-print robes for guest use. The bathroom again, was very tiny but well-stocked with Aveda bath amenities (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and two kinds of soap). I love not having to pack extra toiletries, so having nice products is a big plus. There is no counter space to speak of, but there is a narrow shelf running the length of the mirror. Enough room for toothbrushes, etc. The shower is really high on the wall, perfect for tall people. The water pressure is fine. The biggest surprise for us was the absence of street noise. Our room faced O'Farrell St. and we expected it to be loud, but we remarked every morning how quiet it had been the night before. I think we're used to putting up with noisy SF streets, so it was an unexpected surprise to have such quiet nights.We did not eat at the restaurant but did attend the wine reception one afternoon. For 1 hour each afternoon, there is a wine reception in the lobby with a choice of house red or white wine. Check out a board game from the many choices at the front desk and relax. It's a lot of fun and a good time to meet other guests. There is also coffee and tea available every morning.The staff was always friendly and helpful. Everytime we walked in the doors, there was a welcome back. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Serrano and would go back in an instant. The location can't be beat, the staff friendly and the beds comfy."

Visited San Fran in August '08 then husband and I returned to Serrano for anniversary getaway during Thanksgiving weekend. Can't wait to visit again!Love most everything about this boutique-style hotel. Friendly, accommodating, convenient, great rooms. Walking distance from main tourist attractions and popular restaurants. Love the comfortable bed and clean, quiet rooms. If you can, book an Executive King suite. Bathrooms are huge! I counted 7 shower heads in our shower and it even had a TV! Spacious room, 2 TV's, bed separated from living area by curtain, large sofa pullout in living area. Internet available in hotel room and lobby.Coffee and tea available free in lobby in morning. Wine hour late afternoon. Doorman great with directions. Play a quick game of blackjack when you check in and you might get a free continental breakfast. Pet friendly, restaurant on site but lots of restaurants within walking distance not to be missed.They include Taylor Street Cafe and Doris' for breakfast. Trust me. They're good and reasonable. Expect about a 45 min wait at Doris', worth it.Try Max's for dinner. Also Daily Grill is close. Lots of sushi and Indian eateries nearby. Didn't try them, maybe next trip. A few things I think could be improved. Although they offer coffee in lobby, would like a small pot in room, just to get you off the dime while you're waking up. They need a brand of soap that lasts longer. Parking is expensive, valet service about $45 a day. You don't need a car plus there's nowhere to park in city.About the area, yes, there are a lot of homeless. There are also a lot of tourists. This hotel is on fringe of Tenderloin district but just use common sense and you should be fine. It's also extremely close to one of the main cable car stations, Union Square, shopping, food, the Westfield Mall (love the food court there). And no big hills to negotiate. Serrano is just across from the Hilton so there are always plenty of taxis nearby.Overall, where we stay is a big part of the success of our trips. In this case, the Serrano is our first choice. Good value, walking distance to the main sites, quiet and clean rooms and friendly staff. Although it doesn't have the fancy amenities of luxury hotels it has everything you need in this great city. Check rates on Travelzoo and the hotel website.Happy Travels!"
"Review_12023","hotel_136","hotel_3825","Nov 17, 2008","Serrano - a convenient haven. The Serrano in San Francisco is a superb hotel - we stayed 4 nights from 8th Nov 2008 and loved it. The location is very convenient for all the tourist things - Union Sq, cable car, Golden Gate(by bus from outside the hotel), China town. Also the drop off point for car rentals is just opposite. The Tenderloin is nearby and I was concerned about that but no worries we did not feel at all threatened. The staff were very friendly and helpful - when we checked in we were given a small room - perfectly adequate and comfortable except that we had been travelling for 3 weeks and had 4 large pieces of luggage. When I spoke to the receptionist about this he immediately got us a bigger room and an upgrade and threw in a complimentary breakfast- excellent service. The beds are the most comfortable ever but I would agree with a past review that the shower over the bath is dangerous - last year in a Spanish hotel in the same cicumstances my husband slipped and broke 2 ribs!! There is a free wine reception each night and this is a wonderful idea as it gives an opportunity for socialising with other guests. My only other criticism is that there is no coffee maker in the room. We arrived about noon having been driving for 4 hours and were gasping for a coffee but had to go out to find a coffee shop. Coffee is available in the lobby in the morning up until about 10 0'clock but not thereafter. In conclusion I would compliment the hotel on the friendliness of all the staff and their willingness to offer assistance and advice."

I booked a normal king room and was AMAZED at the room we got. It was on one of the top floors, had an AMAZING view, huge widowns that let in so much light. and the bed... OH MY GOSH!! I came home and ordered Frette linens and am trying to find the same bed (for cheaper then you can buy it from them.)A couple of downsides.. all of the staff seemed like they could have cared less if you were there or not. We were hoping for al least some smiles and pleasant conversation when we checked in. You also have no coffeemake in the room and have to go downstairs in the morning for a cup (not a pot). I wanted some tea late at night and was told I couldn't get any. Also the tub/shower combo... the tub is slpoed on both sides towards the middle, making it VERY difficult to stand in taking a shower without falling.. a little dangerous if you ask me. We had a great time otherwise and plan to return again just for the room. The hotel is in a great area and we found amazing restaurants within a block of it."

Everyone on the staff was courteous and helpful and the hotel itself was charming and well-cared-for.The complimentary wine reception was a great opportunity to relax and socialize between a day of walking and exploring and an evening of great dining.The location was perfect, we dropped off our rental car the first day and walked everywhere. At no time did we feel uncomfortable in the area surrounding the hotel, even walking to and from local restaurants each evening.We would highly recommend the Serrano as a great place to stay while visiting San Francisco."

After reading the reviews on the Serrano I have to say i was a little scared of its location and what I might find!That said San Francisco is rife with homeless, they are everywhere and you cant avoid them and for an Australian like me its hard to digest and hard to ignore and its scary.... but its such a great city you shouldnt let this deter you!The Serrano however was in a great location and so close to Union Sq and the Cable Cars and anything you might want! The staff with courteous, friendly and quick to assist (they have a great doorman!), the rooms were clean, well equipped el;egant and with character (stylish character not worn out charm!)... wine tasting is a great touch, they stock the bathroom with Aveda (my fav!) and the beds are delicious!Dont worry about the location issues others may have mentioned as i mentioned above the homeless are everywhere and there is no way you can avoid them. A sad and sorry sight but otherwise a fabulous city and hotel!"
"Review_12028","hotel_136","hotel_2557","Oct 6, 2008","Wonderful, more than I even expected, experience at the Serrano I recently returned from a 6 day stay at the Serrano and I have nothing but kind words for the entire staff. The doormen were a pleasant welcome coming back from a long day of traveling the city and the front desk staff and concierge were full of helpful dinner/city tips. Complimentary wine fit the experience and gave a great reason to mingle in the cozy lobby.The location of the hotel really couldn't have been better in my opinion. Taking the front desk's advice, take an EASY walk toward Market and you've got everything you need from shopping/transportation/restaurants at your disposal.As far as the rooms, we had to check in early due to the fact we were coming from another hotel (the Serrano didn't have availability our first night). The hotel manager, Antonio was more then accomodating and we were welcomed to a ready-room that was sparkling clean every night when we returned.I would highly recommend this hotel, have absolutely no complaints, and look forward to staying here again."

I booked the Serrano as part of a trip as a present to my Mother for her 65th birthday.She was a bit nervous at first as this was her first visit to the USA, but within minutes of arriving she felt right at home.All the staff we came across were friendly and welcoming, and the service we received from the doormen, check-in staff and restaurant staff was excellent from start to finish.We stayed in on of the 'Luxury Suites' on the 14th floor. The rooms were big and clean with a 32 flat screen in the bedroom and living room. The 'Honor Bar' was well stocked and the bathroom was a tidy size. The nighty wine reception in the lobby from 5 to 6 was also a great bonus. Don't let the comments about the location worry you, it's only a couple of minutes walk to Union Square and we never felt threatened around the hotel once.I would have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone and would definetally stay here again if I was lucky enough to visit San Francisco again.Thanks once again to Mr Flores and his staff for a great stay."

"Review_12032","hotel_136","hotel_9212","Sep 5, 2008","Everything our little family needed at Serrano We stayed five days at the Serrano making it a long labor day weekend. The hotel was very busy but operations were smooth. It is an excellent place to bring a little child - the crib was brought in no time to the room and we had a high-chair in the room for the entire duration of our stay. The room was very quiet, we were lucky to be on the 15th floor where we almost couldn't hear the traffic down there.It's true that the standard room we had was on the small side but it was OK for the three of us. The restaurant (Ponzu) where breakfast is served is OK but not so much my style and rather expensive. San Fran has better places if you go out there! Also be aware of the minibar: it's full of goodies but no free lunch!Location is very convenient with easy access to the city (we walked to Fisherman's on the first day) and public transport on Market Street and the shops. If you take Powell Street to go to Market St you can avoid the Tenderloin area which I'd advise"
"Review_12033","hotel_136","hotel_9643","Aug 31, 2008","Luke Warm About Serrano First let me start by saying that the staff at the Serrano was wonderful! The door man greeted us each day by name and the concierge was most helpful in giving us information regarding city. The hotel is centrally located to Union square which makes catching the trolley to all other sites (i.e. China town, Fisherman's Wharf) easy, however, if you go 1 block down and to the east of the hotel you will be overcome by Homeless people. This made me feel extremely uncomfortable and is definetely something I'm not accustomed to seeing while on vacation. The rooms are really small. As my husband said, I can't even change my mind in this room let alone my clothes. And the closet smelled bad. We stayed 3 nights and I have to confess that I was excited to move on to our next hotel. I wish I would have listened to my husband, gone for modern, and stayed in the Financial District instead of being sucked into the charm of a bygone era."
"Review_12034","hotel_136","hotel_9699","Aug 25, 2008","Close to Cable Car and Shopping This hotel is ok to stay at when visiting San Francisco. It is only 5 minutes away from the Powell cable car station (by foot) and also very close to Union Square (great shopping, Saks, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, plenty of well-known brands). 5 Starbucks in walking distance. The rooms, at least the one I stayed in, was fairly small, with a very modern TV. The room was ok, nothing outstanding. Donwside: You cannot open the window, the air is quite stuffy and the windows are steamed up from the outside, not possible to get a great view over San Francisco. They do wine-tastings in the entrance hall. The staff was helpful but not over-friendly. The waiters in the breakfast room struggled with English. For breakfast I expected more, no buffet or anything. The bagel I had was rather plain. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice though, Asian-style cuisine with very friendly and polite staff. The food was good. The staff made the dining worthwhile, you felt very welcome. The doorman said not to walk to the direction away from the Hilton (you can see the Hilton from the serrano Hotel), apparently not a nice area. If you can afford more, I would still recommend to stay elsewhere."
"Review_12035","hotel_136","hotel_6953","Aug 22, 2008","Great Hotel! Aug 9-10 My husband and I decided to get a jump start on our 5 year wedding anniversary, (08-16-03), by staying at SF for one night. We are SPG members and enjoy staying at Le Meridien and Westin Hotels. This was our first time at a Kimpton Hotel and the Serrano made a lasting impression. From the doorman to reception personnel, it seems as though everyone just returned from a weekend long customer service training. Smiles, how are you doing, and may I help you? from everyone. After reading many positive reviews, I found the Asst GM, Antonio Flores. I decided to confirm our stay by emailing him directly and informing him of our special occassion. The only expectation I had was for a king size bed and perhaps some chocolate on the pillows. Boy, was I surprised. Upon opening the door, we saw a small platter of strawberries and chilled champagne. The room was very nice and spacious with a jacuzzi (executive king room). Our plans were to go shopping in Union, eat at a nice restaurant (Ana Mandara) and enjoy the night life of SF. We only completed the first two and enjoy the room instead of night life. We would stay at this hotel again, not because of Mr. Flores recognized our special occassion and went the extra mile, but the overall service from staff. The hotel itself was very nice, of course, cozy and elegant. For future SF getaways, we would stay here versus our usual hotels. Location was great, two blocks from Union Square. Safety was not an issue. Lots of people enjoying the weekend night life. We parked adjacent to hotel for $30 total per night. Thank you again to Serrano Staff and Mr. Flores."
"Review_12036","hotel_136","hotel_6558","Aug 20, 2008","Incredible Stay I'm usually very cynical about hotels and don't typically write to praise a hotel. This hotel breaks the mold and has impressed me to the point of writing a positive review.The staff was incredibly friendly and professional: from the concierge acknowledgment to us as we walked in to the bellman remembering our names throughout the entire stay...we truly felt important. The rooms were very clean with plenty of room and plenty of amenities. The staff was incredibly helpful with great food recommendations that were both affordable and close. They also were helpful in general San Francisco information.This hotel bumps up against the tenderloin area, but I would never have guessed that there was ever any danger. My wife and i never once felt that we were in a threatening or uncomfortable situation concerning our safety.My only complaint with the hotel is minor in that the toilet seat would not stay up as I tried to use the restroom...my wife found this trick useful :).The Serrano Hotel was so good that my wife and I decided to call and book another Kimpton hotel when we return to San Francisco...We booked the Prescott Hotel. Nothing but the highest praises for the Serrano Hotel, the staff, and the Kimpton properties."
"Review_12037","hotel_136","hotel_8847","Aug 19, 2008","Very Cool I was a little nervous since my husband was convinced the Hotel would be in the Tenderloin and I was trying to point out that it was close to Union Square. When we pulled up in the taxi the Doorman grabbed our suitcase - asked us our name and escorted us to the front desk. The service was delightful and we were 2 little blocks from Union Square - Ha Ha! So it is a perfect location. It has a very European feel to it and the guests were mostly European. They have a game theme - there are games to play in the lobby + a check-in game which I missed. And they have toys to play with in the room -- cute. We were very satisfied with our stay and we would stay there again."
"Review_12038","hotel_136","hotel_3840","Aug 17, 2008","Excellent hotel On our recent visit to the Bay area, we decided to try a different hotel every night. I'm partially glad we did this but also wish we had our complete stay at this excellent hotel.We stayed at The Fairmont and upgraded to a Tower Signature Suite, we had a King Executive Room at the Hotel Rex and an upgraded room at Serrano. By far, we enjoyed the Serrano the most. Mr. Antonio Flores and the rest of the excellent staff made our stay much nicer with his personalized service.Our arrival was early, nonetheless, our room was thankfully available. All requested amenities were honored, such as an upper floor with a view, feather pillows, etc. Mr. Flores made sure that there was a personalized welcome item, based on a discussion I'd had with him via email. Nobody else givers that level of service!The hotel is on the cusp of the Tenderloin district but we had no issues and quickly learned to avoid walking in that direction. I felt completely safe in the immediate area around and within the hotel and in the direction of Union Square. The hotel is an easy walk to excellent shopping and transportation (giving easy access to the entire city). I was a bit surprised at the relative paucity of fine dining in the entire area, but this is no reflection on the hotel (and maybe I just didn't wander to the right spots).Our room was large and the bathroom, with jacuzzi, had the best shower of all three hotels. I believe that this was the hotel that had Aveeda bath products, my personal favorite. Our room was clean, had free Internet access, and well lit. Emergency routes were well-marked. The only fault I could come up with is that it's impossible to get to the bathroom if the sofa bed is extended. But, being part acrobat, I was able to get there without waking my family.The concierge was most helpful in arranging a last minute tour for us and ensured that it all went smoothly. He had great suggestions. I really can't say too may good things about this facility and, even without considering the most reasonable room rate, Serrano beat out its competitors...hands down, including the upgraded Fairmont room.I heartily recommend this hotel, regardless of travel budget. A final special thanks again to Mr. Flores."
"Review_12039","hotel_136","hotel_6709","Aug 17, 2008","Consistently Kimpton I often stay at Kimpton Hotels for work, but this week visited the Serrano in San Francisco for fun. What I really like about this chain is that the quality and little perks are consistent. I know they'll have good coffee in the lobby every morning and the New York Times. The wine in the afternoon is such a nice bonus. My room in SF was spotless, as always. The sheets are always crisp and I love the feather pillows of assorted sizes. One quirk that it might be time to address is the cheesy robes that look like they came out of a 70s bachelor pad. Leopard print terry is not tasteful. Let's think about some white waffle weave spa robes. Additionally, I've been pretty impressed with the frequent traveller program. I've been consistently upgraded at almost every stay. Other programs say they'll do that but they never seem to deliver. If I had one gripe it's the astronomical parking fees. $40, even for SF is excessive and seems wrong when directly across the street the garage is charging $10 less. It sends the a nickel-and-diming message to guest and it really stands out since so much is on the mark."
"Review_12040","hotel_136","hotel_3607","Aug 6, 2008","Good hotel for the adventuresome The Serrano is a lovely old hotel billed as being in the theatre district of San Francisco. The hotel itself was very nice. Interesting old world feel to the lobby. Very helpful staff. Extremely spacious rooms. Nice added touch is the afternoon wine tasting. However, the location, while only 3 blocks from Union Square, appeared to be a little iffy. The theatres I saw were a couple of blocks away and appeared dark. Maybe the area is better when shows are playing.The other downside was the restaurant at breakfast. It didn't open until 8 am on the weekends. Not good for a group trying to catch a tour bus at 8:15! The one day we were able to eat there, it was extremely slow with one waitress constantly telling us I'm not the only server whenever we would ask for something. Breakfast food was average at best.Overall, it was a good hotel with a spacious room and very comfortable bed. Pluses do outweigh the minuses."

I emailed Mr. Antonio Flores before our trip, and he was helpful in accommodating our late check-out request. Check-in was fast and professional (no mention of the priceline reservation).Here are the pluses and minuses of our room:+ Funky decor (Kimpton hotels aren't cookie cutter hotels, that's for sure! This Kimpton is fun, although it may not suit all tastes).+ Super Comfy Bed (this is really important to me).+ Impeccably clean (the room was spotless)+ Evening wine/beer reception in lobby (we only made one of these, but it was fun)+ Super helpful and friendly staff- Small rooms. (This is an old building, so space is tight. We knew this going in and I would actually count this as part of the charm, but people with different tastes should be aware).In all, I'd love to stay at the Serrano again. It's a nicely run operation!"
"Review_12042","hotel_136","hotel_2179","Aug 3, 2008","Cheap and average I was on 3 day break from London to see friends in San Francisco. This hotel was cheap being booked through Kimpton's website, with a discount that you get if you subscribe to their in-touch programme (which is free). The cost was only about 拢60 per night and for that then you really don't get the right to complain about much.The room was fine although on the small side and a little noisy near the elevator and on a low level (I had requested the opposite but the hotel was full). Reasonably clean although the bathroom was tiny and I had to angle my legs to sit on the toilet because the bath was too close on one side.The air con outlet made a strange rattling noise which was bothersome.As a base to go out and party though it's fine, the location is good enough and despite the minor issues this place does represent good value and I would stay here again."
"Review_12043","hotel_136","hotel_7532","Jul 26, 2008","Not one of Kimpton's best... Kimpton has a reputation for having beautiful, boutique-style hotels that offer exceptional service. The Serrano Hotel in San Francisco was a disappointment. The location is fantastic in the most walkable city in America. We were able to get to all modes of transportation easily, great shopping was nearby, and great restaurants were convenient. But the hotel is not run like a typical Kimpton.Be prepared...because it is in downtown, the spaces in the hotel feel squeezed. The rooms are small. I stayed in a double-double with my husband, two kids, and a dog, luckily for just one night. Afterwards, I stayed in a queen room, corner of the building, and the room felt perfect for one person. Kimpton is supposed to be pet friendly. Though my dog was allowed, no special attention was given, as occurs at other Kimptons. Also, next time I go to San Fran with a pet, I need to choose a place that has some grass/plants around so he can do his business!Except for the doormen, all the staff assisted us with a smile. However, they had odd policies. Kimpton places a placard in the bathrooms to let you know what they can provide in case you forgot something. But when my friend mentioned she needed a toothbrush (something the placard says the hotel will provide free), she was told to get one from the honor bar! At $3.00. The hotel provides room service, but don't plan on using it early in the morning on the weekend. We had an 8 am bus to catch, and room service was not available until 8 oclock that morning. Unfortunately, I hadn't seen the fine print on the order form and was counting on a 7 am meal from the hotel. I had to give my money to the Starbucks in the hotel across the street instead.My complaints are all relatively small, but when you expect exceptional service and don't experience it, then the interpretation is disappointing. Won't stay there again...sorry, Serrano."

"Review_12045","hotel_136","hotel_8370","Jul 13, 2008","Nice boutique hotel, would stay here again I won this hotel through Priceline, and felt we got a great deal for the price. The hotel is located right next to the Tenderloin, which leads to some questionable activities if you walk two blocks in the wrong direction, but it is also really close to all the great shopping and eats in Union Square. Since we were pretty familiar with the area, we knew where to walk and where to avoid, so the location was good for what we wanted to do. Parking here is indeed pricey, but there are two parking garages next to the hotel that offer overnight parking for $30. We've stayed in a couple of Kimpton properties before that were more contemporary and modern, but we liked the feel of this hotel nonetheless. The rooms are cozy (which is the case in most hotels here in SF) but clean and well furnished. We liked the wine and beer tasting in the lobby between 5-6pm, even if our anti-social selves just used it to take some free wine up to our room! Only downside was when we called the front desk to ask for some toothbrushes/toothpaste (yup, we are the travelers that forgot) and after waiting in our rooms for half an hour, finally went downstairs to get it. Apparently the front desk person forgot to send it up - he did apologize, and then informed us he only had toothbrushes, no paste. We were told we could walk down to the corner market and pick up some. This wasn't a big deal, but since the room has signs that clearly state a list of complementary items they had available for us forgetful travelers (and toothpaste was one of them), I thought it was a bit discouraging.Overall, I thought this was a nice hotel with a decent location. If you can score it for under $100/night, you won't be displeased!"

I have stayed at the Serrano 4 times in the last few months and will continue to come back. We stayed over the 4th of July holiday weekend and you would never know the property was sold out. It was quiet and the only time we saw other guests, was either in the elevator or at the awesome wine/beer hour. From the doorman, front desk staff, housekeeping and maintenance staff we were always greet you with a hello. There are many choices in and around Union Square and honestly, we continue to choose the Serrano for its laid back, comfortable hospitality.

We received our room at a rate of $99 (before taxes of course), which we received when we used the hotel website.For our purposes, it was my first time in SF and my boyfriend's 15th, we were total tourists. So this hotel was in a good location. I did find out when we went out one night, that you have to watch out which streets you go down b/c the hotel is located near the tenderloin district, but I have to do that in NYC, so it wasn't a big deal and we had no problems.We liked that we could get coffee in the morning in the Lobby as well as newspapers.

"Review_12055","hotel_136","hotel_7916","Jun 6, 2008","Did not meet expectations ...... CONS - Let's just start off with the CONS so you don't waste your time researching for the Serrano HotelFirst, let me start off with the hotel rates. I saw the rates for $104.88 per night on travelocity, so I decided to book via the hotel website itself incase i wanted to cancel for a better rate if available at the Westin. When I called in to request for a rate, they gave me $140+. I then asked why it was so high compared to what I saw on travelocity, and they put me on hold for a quick minute and then responded with we will match that. I think that alone is very decieving as they were able to knock off $40 per night for us within 1 min.Second - although you see all the reviews of this location being in a convenient spot, at night, this street is pretty quiet and so is the intersection where the Hilton is located. There also seems to be more homeless people loitering around this area compared to others. Third - This hotel will charge you $50 (believe this is some insurance charge) each night you stay on top of the room rate. This will be deducted from your form of payment and supposedly will be returned back to your account. Either right after check out or 48 hours after check out. Which is fine if they actually return the money back to you. Fourth - When my boyfriend and I checked in, the person at the front desk gave us two key cards that did not even work for our hotel room PLUS charged us TWICE for our stay and didn't even acknowledge what he did. My boyfriend didn't know either until he looked at his online statement - thankfully for that. When we notified the front desk of this situation, all they did was apologize and contacted their accounting dept who unfortunately told us they couldn't even do anything. So I stepped in and asked, if you are going to return our $50 insurance charge per night upon our check out, why can't you return the second charge as this is not a valid charge? They could not even give me an answer nor did they try to resolve it. So finally, the next front desk person we spoke with said she will try the accounting dept. again and give us a call the following business day, Monday (we left on a friday). At this point - it is now Thursday, no refund was made nor did they even bother contacting us. I believe they are waiting and expecting us to dispute the charge from the bank which is completely insane and the transaction and investigation for the dispute will take weeks compared to just a refund from the hotel itself - we have already notified them of this delay and nothing has been done. This amount was a lot too and he had used his debit card. Fifth - They give you keys for the bar which is located in the tv shelf. They tell you the keys are for the bar and make it sound like anything from the bar is complimentary. I first thought the drinks/snacks were complimentary but they don't mention you have to pay for everything until you ask - nor do they leave a sign anywhere about it compared the other hotels I've stayed at. Conclusion - Hotel was really small, pictures of the hotel gave a much bigger and nicer impression of the hotel until we walked in it. The next time I visit, I think I will stay at the Westin and pay 50 dollars more for just the convenience, safety, security, bigger room and a staff who can provide even an ounce of satisfaction to their guests. PROSDoormen were nice and rooms were clean.Please find a hotel that's either by Fisherman's Wharf or right next to the Union Square park. Spending that extra money per night is worth it."

"Review_12057","hotel_136","hotel_8359","May 23, 2008","Stop Looking and Book Here! We ended up staying here after the Palace and the Sir Francis Drake were sold out. I'm so glad that our first two choices were booked because our misfortune led us to my favourite hotel, hands down! First off, the price was moderate considering how expensive boutique hotels in Union Square are. Then we had the option to upgrade our room to a king sized suite for only $49 extra/night. It was well worth it. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was to die for. The decor of the bedroom was fabulously fun and chic without being pretentious. In fact, I loved the room so much that I was trying to cancel some of the activities I had planned just so I could spend more time lounging in our amazing room! Also, the bed was incredibly comfortable. In addition to all this, the hotel rooms and amenities were well thought out and I found myself discovering little details that made my stay even more enjoyable (board games and such).The decor in the lobby and elevators is a lovely introduction to the hotel and the front desk personnel and door men are very helpful (Pam in particular at the front desk made my trip much easier).Anyways, I could make this already long and glowing review even longer because I loved the Serrano so much but I'll stop here and urge people reading this to book a room here ASAP! This will definitely be the only hotel I stay in when I go back to San Fran!"

We booked a two bed smoking room, and when we arrived, were told that they could not accommodate us. Great.So we go up to the room. Seems ok. I start to unpack and find a pair of dirty undies in the closet. I go downstairs, and they tell me there is nothing they can do because the hotel is completely sold out for the night. I demand some sort of compensation and am basically called a liar by the manager on duty."
"Review_12059","hotel_136","hotel_8255","May 7, 2008","Great location, small room, superb staff. V Happy We booked via Hotwire.com so got a rate around $120 a night. And for that, it was superb. The hotel is lovely, the lobby great, the free wine - a nice perk, the staff, all of them, 100% fantastic.We suffered no problems with noise. The panhandlers seem a common feature of SF and none were aggressive. To be honest, all my memories of the panhandlers are of charming people trying to charm a few cents off you (I went outside for smokes frequently so met a fair few of them lol)The only thing I'd say is that if I'd paid rack rates for the same Queen room I'd have been very miffed at $299 - the room was as small as could be. It was lovely, and worked well, but put it this way, if you have your TV cabinet doors extended, you can't get from one side of the bed to the other. Not a problem, but not worth 300 bucks in my mind. Saying that - it probably is for central SF.I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel if space is not an issue. Oh - free Internet, which is essential for us as we are travelling extensively.We have now moved to the Cathedral Hill Hotel - which has rack rates at the same as the Hotwire rates for the Serrano - none of the charm but the room is twice the size. This counts a lot for us as we are here for 5 nights. But put it this way, we'd have stayed at the Serrano if we could have secured more nights at the same rate.Book with confidence! (oh and for Hotwire fans - it's the 3.5 star thumbs up Boutique option in the area :-) )"

"Review_12061","hotel_136","hotel_1310","Apr 29, 2008","Had a great stay! We found a great deal for this hotel - $109/night for a King room - so we booked a two night stay right away! For the most part, we really enjoyed our stay. We got in late Saturday night and were upgraded to a suite, which was an unexpected surprise. The hotel was beautiful, had great detail, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The one small problem we had was that the walls are very thin. We often heard doors slamming, and people's conversations, and that was a bit annoying. In addition, there were $20/night in taxes, and the parking was $40/night! There is a safe place to park (I was worried it might not be as safe to not use the hotel's parking) on Taylor right next to the hotel - only $24/night. They were full when we got there, so we just sucked it up, but I would definitely recommend it.The location of the hotel makes it VERY easy to get to Union Square - we had a couple dodgy moments, but we still felt as safe as we were in other areas. But overall - the hotel was great, the beds were super comfy, and everything was nice and clean. I would definitely stay at this hotel again..."
"Review_12062","hotel_136","hotel_3579","Apr 22, 2008","Lovely Stayed at the Serrano for a week around newyears. Quite a bargain for approx 90 euro's a night including taxes, considering location and quality of service. Very close to all the shops and Union Square. Cable car around the corner, as well as the BART - a breeze to get to and from the airport via public transportation. Service was good: efficient and friendly. The room wasn't huge, but more than adequate. Good shower, nice amenities, and - most importantly - a great bed. The leopard-print bathrobes are hilarious (in a good way). No problems with noise, inside or outside the hotel. On the downside windows don't open, which can create a bit of a stuffy atmosphere. Unfortunately far too many hotels have this issue. In short, an excellent place to stay if you're visiting SF. The odd interior won me over in the end; it beats the cookie-cutter hotel average. The Serrano deserves a higher rating on the popularity index than it current position in the 50s."
"Review_12063","hotel_136","hotel_2271","Apr 21, 2008","Loved the free wine! Found this hotel with a great review on travelzoo.com when it was going for $100 a night - definitely a steal!My sister and I enjoyed the complimentary wine bar from 5-6. They were very generous pourers, and we quickly found ourselves talking to the other guests and sharing stories and tips about the city.The rooms were a little on the small side, but comfy, especially the beds and the down comforters and pillows! Aveda ammenities were also a nice touch.If breakfast is not included in the rate, I suggest skipping the hotel's b-fast and head out to one of the many dinners on your walk to union square. It will cost you less.Location is great and not too noisy. There is a section near the hotel that you shouldn't cross into at night, but we didn't have any trouble.Definitely would recommend the hotel, especially at $100 a night!"
"Review_12064","hotel_136","hotel_3275","Apr 21, 2008","Great location, great service Booked the Serrano for a 3-night weekend stay in San Francisco. The location is great, it's right across the street from the Hilton San Francisco, easy access to Powell Station for Cable Cars, BART, and MUNI.The room and bathroom were a little cramped for 2 double beds, but this is downtown San Francisco, you're not spending your time in the hotel room. Room was exceptionally clean.Late check-in and luggage storage were handled with great care. Had no issues.Favorite part of the stay? Every evening at 5:00pm there is a Wines of the World reception in the lobby with complimentary wine and beer. Great way to unwind after walking around the city!"
"Review_12065","hotel_136","hotel_8161","Apr 15, 2008","Great price/location We stayed at the Serrano Hotel for 5 days in March  had a great time in San Francisco. The hotel was close to Union Square (within walking distance), the BART station and the Powell St cable car line. Lots of dining locations to choose from. If you take the BART from the SF Airport - take Powell St north to O'Farrell and head west to Taylor St. We made the mistake of heading east from the BART and walked through the Tenderloin District - not the nicest area, lots of homeless people. All in all, a good place to stay - love the evening wine service in the lobby and the board games available for playing anytime. Take the cable car to the wharf - about 2 mile walk - but it actually takes awhile with the steep hills."
"Review_12066","hotel_136","hotel_2922","Apr 9, 2008","Great Start!!! Would go again..... Great start to our honeymoon, were a little worried reading some reviews going on about the area. We had no problems, Yes you might see the odd weirdo but lets face it you can see them anywhere. The hotel was more than expected, the room was very clean and comfortable, and as it was our honeymoon we had asked for a high room and the hotel obliged by giving us a room on the top floor 17th or something like that. The location is handy for everything (Dollar rent a car is right round the corner) and if travelling to San Fran again I would stay in this hotel again. Overall an excelent start to our trip round the USA. Next stop Santa Barbara.5*"
"Review_12067","hotel_136","hotel_8280","Apr 4, 2008","Serrano was absolutely perfect We have just returned from a trip to California/Las Vegas and San Francisco was our first stop. The Serrano sounded so good on Tripadvisor and it lived up to its reputation.The room was absolutely beautiful, extremely comfortable and clean. In reviews it was said that the rooms were small but we found it adequate and spaceous for our needs. The staff were extremely friendly and it was great to come back to the hotel after a day of sightseeing and be greeted with smiles and the use of your name. So well done all at Serrano, my husband and I will definately be back when we return to San Francisco, you made us feel welcome, special and at home."
"Review_12068","hotel_136","hotel_7020","Apr 1, 2008","Great Location--Even Better Bed The Serrano is part of the Kimpton boutique chain. All related hotels host evening wine/beer hours in the lobby, which is a very nice perk.Check-in was unbelievably smooth. I had been staying at another Kimpton (Hotel Triton) earlier in the week and checked out at noon before walking the 1/3 mile to the Serrano. I fully expected to not be able to check in, but I had hoped to at least leave my luggage before heading out again. Much to my surprise, I was greeted warmly and given my preferred room immediately.My room was on the 12th floor and had a so-so view east of Union Square. My room was wonderful--decadently comfortable queen sized bed, sufficent armoire and tv, and decent bathroom with bath/shower combo and Aveda products. The rooms aren't large, but you are hard-pressed to find large rooms in the middle of San Francisco. The room was spotless and was immaculately tended to each morning by housekeeping.I'm a member of the loyalty program with Kimpton, which includes a gift upon each arrival. When I arrived to my room, I found a 16 oz. bottle of spring water and a small box of Napa-produced truffles. Very nice touch.The concierge assisted me twice--once to arrange shuttle transportation to the airport and another time to make reservations for my party at a nearby restaurant. Each time, Chad was most gracious and helpful.My only complaint was with room-service from the adjacent restaurant (Ponzu). On my last morning there, I ordered breakfast and was told delivery would take place within 30 minutes. After 55 minutes, I called to inquire about the order since my shuttle was due to pick me up in 45 minutes. I was told that the kitchen was backed up and my order would not be ready for at least another 25 minutes. I emphasized that I had been conveyed different information when I placed the order and that I would need to cancel the order due to my shuttle. Within 5 minutes, I had a knock at the door and my breakfast was ushered into the room. The restaurant manager had delivered it and then told me it was on the house. In spite of the frustration of waiting, I felt it had been handled very well.One final note: many reviewers have commented/complained about the large number of transients in the area. San Francisco is a large city and the Serrano Hotel is located in the middle of it all. Unfortunately, homelessness is a very sad reality of city life in the United States. I did not encounter one hostile transient during my entire stay. I felt completely safe and comfortable (and spent much of my time alone). Homelessness makes much of us uncomfortable--and it should. But it is not a threatening issue that should dissuade visitors from staying in the Union Square area.It's hard to go wrong with a Kimpton property."

The foyer is lovely and the staff were friendly, especially John and Chad who greeted us as we came in, helped with tours and were generally fun. The room was on the small side, but had lovely decor, the beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. Close to Powell St and Union Square. There were homeless people nearby but they did not cause us any problem.One waitress in Ponzu restaurant was unfriendly at breakfast time, but the other staff were fine.I would definitely stay here again."

Bathroom is small but they've at least tried to make some counter space. Hotel was for quiet, except for the high pressure window spraying at 6:30 am. Lobby is beautiful. I checked in very late on a Sunday night, curb service was outstanding and front desk was efficient checking in (and out.)Only problems were food related: no coffee in room. The service at Ponzu restaurant for breakfast was actually hostile, although we were able to go out into the lobby for the free coffee and bring it back into the Ponzu to drink. Bar is fine in the evening but closes early. However there are other excellent restaurants nearby, and the Hilton across the street has a top-floor bar with an awesome view."

"Review_12073","hotel_136","hotel_7558","Feb 28, 2008","Unique decor, nice service good location I stay at Kimpton Hotels whenever I can. First because they are pet friendly and I often bring my small dog and second you can always rely on them to be interesting, well appointed and comfortable. I found the Serrano to be no different. An older building it is attractive and has a decor that is unique. The rooms are slightly on the small side, but the beds are comfortable, there is good water pressure and they are are attractively decorated. The toiletries are nice and the rooms are always clean. The staffs are always friendly and helpful and the concierage service extraordinary. As per a previous reviewer I too have found that as Kimpton loyalty member, the Serrano does not always provide the amenities the you are supposed to get, but that said a bottle of warm water and a biscotti (that seems to be the usual for me)is really not missed. But if say you are going to provide something you should.I would definately stay at the Serrano again, in fact I am booked for this upcoming weekend. As far as the location is concerned I never felt unsafe and it is close to Union Square and Powell Street"
"Review_12074","hotel_136","hotel_2008","Feb 21, 2008","Good (not great) hotel if you can catch a deal on Priceline First, let me say that overall, this was a good hotel. The room was cute. It was in a good location and I would stay here again (if I can get it for $80 on Priceline, but I would never pay $200 for the room that we got). Okay, so the hotel's website is pretty misleading. Let's just say that the hotel hired an excellent photographer. The lobby and rooms look many times larger than the actual size. We just decided to pretend that our room was a bedroom, not an actual hotel room and it felt a little better. There was just enough space to walk around the bed and that was it. That said, the room was cute, very cozy and comfortable. Things weren't quite as nice as the pictures - the bedskirt was pretty rumpled and the windows were pretty dirty - but it wasn't horribly objectionable, just not what I had been expecting. Service wise, it was mixed. We arrived early, around 11 a.m., and we were able to check in at arrival and were given a room on the top (17th) floor. Yay! However, strangely, later in the day when we were returning from shopping we saw some sort of employee exiting our room. Seemed kind of wierd considering we were already checked in and it wasn't really time to start cleaning the room. We called and then went to the front desk to try to figure out what was going on. They kind of blew us off, but eventually decided that it was somebody checking the minbar. Hmm...that's the first time, I've seen that, but whatever. Also, unlike other reviewers, nobody happily greeted us upon entrance and exit. Not a big deal, but I think we were expecting a bit more of a pampering atmosphere, and it was more like self serve. In regards to location, it was conveniently located close to shopping and the BART and MUNI. That was very nice and worth quite a bit. As others have said there is a major homeless problem in the area. Normally, I can just ignore them and keep walking but this past trip was a different experience entirely. I was followed, called a [--] and had objects thrown at me. Not entirely pleasant, but I just tried to brush it off. Afterall, it makes a good story. And a side note, in regards to the oft mentioned Dottie's Tru Blue Cafe, which is about a block from the hotel. So NOT worth it. We waited in line for about an hour and a half for breakfast. The experience was interesting I guess...I mean how often do you get to watch crack heads pacing back and forth in front of you or see a drug deal on the corner? The food was good, but not great and definitely not worth the wait. Personally, I would have been just as happy with a muffin from Starbucks."
"Review_12075","hotel_136","hotel_5133","Feb 20, 2008","Tres Boutique When proffered about a hotel, boutique usually means old, small and dated. That pretty much sums up the Serrano. Add to that the neighborhood where homeless people play dice just outside the hotel entrance, and you get a less than satisfactory stay for the price.It is not a bad hotel really, but I would definitely not recommend it either. If this were a discount hotel, I would say forgive the problems and give it a try. The beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly. It is certainly adequate. It is just far from luxurious.If you are from Europe, you will be very satisfied with the room sizes. If you are used to U.S. hotel room sizes, you will be extremely disappointed. The bathroom was so small, I kept bumping my head and other body parts just turning around in it. I would complain about the size of the bedroom except that I visited a different room that a collegue was staying in and in comparison to his my room was downright spacious.They have free internet access, which is wonderful. However, despite supposedly being high speed, the speed I got was far closer to dial up. The TV was good however. They actually had quite a few channels.This has been a somewhat rambling review. The bottom line is that at the regular price, this is not the hotel for you. The rooms are clean but small and the location is on the edge of a very bad section of town. If you somehow get a bargain discount, it might be worth it. Just go into it with an open eye."

And for the next three nights, the same bellmen greated us with Hello Fresno after telling him where we were traveling from once. The next morning when we were asking for directions, the person at the check in counter challeneged us to a game of 21, we beat the dealer and got 2 complimentry breakfests at Ponzu. The rooms are perfect size, if you're expecting a giant hotel room that isn't old then your in the wrong city, everything in SF has charm.

Stay Monday, Feb. 4 - Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2008This was my fourth time staying at the Serrano (3 times in 2007, 1st time in 2008). We have kept coming back because the experience is fun, and because as return stayers there is such a nice welcome back. Not this time...The bellman is great, friendly, he knows who you are just by teling him where you are coming from. At check-in we were asked if this was our first time staying at the hotel. I told the man that this was our 4th time, and asked if our Kimpton In-Touch loyalty number was attached to our reservation in the computer (I thought maybe it was not showing up in the computer that we were return customers because the loyalty number was not attached to the reservation). He said that our loyalty number was attached to the reservation.We proceeded to the room. In the past, there has always been a nice note and some treats (cookies, drinks, small bottle of wine) in the room welcoming us back as loyal, returning guests. There was nothing there. I thought maybe something would be coming later. Nope...nothing. So, again, I thought maybe our number is really not attached to our reservation. The following morning I went to the front desk and let them know that we usually have a little something waiting in our room as in-touch loyalty members, and nothing was there, so I just wanted to double check that the loyalty number was in the computer. The woman checked and just simply said Yes, it's there. I guess I have been spoiled, but I was disappointed that there was nothing waiting for us, and no special welcoming feel this time. We were going to head out for the day (around 8 am) and got some change from the front desk. The woman then said she would try to send up something for us, inquired where we were from, made small talk. I thought that was nice and we would have something when we get back. Nope! When we returned, the room was clean, but no goodies were there.Got back around 2 pm and took a nap. Was awoken with a knock at the door at around 4 pm. A woman handed me a bottle of water and a little box with 2 chocolates...not exactly the same touch as before.At check-out the next morning, the same woman at the front desk who the previous day looked in the computer for our loyalty number asked me if I wanted to sign up to join Kimpton In-Touch. I told her we are already members, is the number not there? (She just checked on this for me the day before) She said, oh yes, the number is here. She asked us if we have stayed at the hotel before. I told her this was our 4th visit. The hotel was not busy at all, so I was confused as to how so many staff members at the front desk didn't have a clue about anything.I booked the reservation though the Kimpton website after logging in with my loyalty number, so I was expecting to receive all the perks that go along with that. Instead, I felt like we were treated as if we booked through Priceline or something (I should have done that--I would have gotten a better deal, and the same service).I am normally not a complainer--but I definitely feel like the experience for the return customer is different now than it was in the past. I think the front desk needs some help. There are lots of hotels in SF Union Square and the reason I would return to the Serrano was consistent service where I felt they recognized repeat customers. Even with me giving them many hints, they still did not get it. I was not impressed this time, and I think it is time to try some different hotels when we go to SF."

Hotel was exactly what was pictured on the Internet, staff was extremely friendly and upbeat. Serrano is a boutique hotel, which would usually mean old and small, but we found it extremely charming, quiet and very clean. It was located within walking distance to Union Square. I would stay there again! Also recommend the Taylor Street Coffee Shop, just a few doors down! Excellent breakfast, great value, quick service! Recommend parking your car across the street to save a little money ($40 for valet, $30 for do-it-yourself)."

"Review_12082","hotel_136","hotel_2329","Jan 8, 2008","A Windy Long Weekend in San Fran My wife and I stayed four nights at the Serrano Hotel in San Francisco from January 3 to 7, 2008. We had never stayed at the Serrano Hotel before, but since it is part of the Kimpton boutique hotel chain that my wife and I enjoy, we thought that we'd give it a try. I booked our King Deluxe room via the Kimpton website for $126 per night (plus tax), a rate that I thought was very reasonable for downtown San Francisco.We arrived Thursday night at 10 pm during the worst winter storm of the season (our flight from Canada was delayed 3 hours due to the storm conditions in San Francisco). Unfortunately, after a long trip getting to San Francisco, we did not get the warm Serrano Hotel welcome advertised on many web pages and websites. Don't get me wrong, everyone was decent to us, but there was no offer of a game of 21 to upgrade our room (as mentioned in the bedside book in our room), and the concierge desk person was less than enthusiastic when I asked about any half-decent places to eat on a late Thursday evening in the immediate area (we had missed dinner due to the flight delay).Speaking of the immediate area around the Serrano Hotel, it is less than upscale. In fact, the neighbourhood, despite being only two blocks from Union Square and kitty-korner to the San Francisco Hilton, is what one might call Transitional. That is, by day the neighbourhood is okay, but come darkness, the streets are taken over by homeless people and panhandlers. Furthermore, the streets in the area are very dark, lacking sufficient municipal street lighting. Some people may find the idea of walking alone at night too scary to try...As for the Serrano Hotel itself, it is a three star property (based on the five star scale). Some websites refer to it as a four star property, but it is not! The lobby is nice and clean, with a feeling of the roaring 20s. Our room, a King Deluxe, was also clean and contained the blessed Kimpton King Size bed (there are no Tall Rooms at the Serrano Hotel). As always, we had excellent sleeps in the Kimpton bed, but our room was extremely small with a very plain and basic bathroom. We can only hope that one-day the Kimpton people will hear about flat screen Plasma and LCD television, and start installing 42 inch sets into their hotel rooms instead of the small 20 year old television sets they currently utilize. Other than our first night when we enquired about a local place to eat, we found the staff to be quite friendly, with many staff members going out of their way to say hello to us or to ask if we needed help with anything. The various concierge staff were excellent at arranging dinner reservations and taxis for us, while the cleaning staff did an excellent job of keeping our room clean and tidy.Overall, we rate our Serrano Hotel experience as okay, but not quite what we have come to expect from Kimpton properties. If one must stay in the Union Square area, then the Sir Francis Drake, also a Kimpton property, would be a much better choice. But our favorite Kimpton San Francisco area hotel remains The Argonaut Hotel at the corner of Jefferson and Hyde on Fisherman's Wharf. For just a few dollars more, The Argonaut Hotel is in a far superior class to the Serrano Hotel, and at The Argonaut Hotel you get the bonus of staying in an area of town that is fun, safe and filled with excellent tourist and eating options."

This small boutique hotel provided us with the very personal service (How are you today, Mr.  Mrs. H?) that makes you feel special. We were upgraded for free for our honeymoon. The executive suite is lovely, with large jacuzzi tub, lots of granite tile, and antique furniture. Beautiful lobby, very clean room, and pretty, cheerful decor takes away from the drab rain of the city, and is so much nicer than the generic big-box hotel rooms. Great firm mattress, fine linens and down duvet. Prompt attention to small problems or requests. Concierge got us into a great nearby restaurant (John's Grill) at the last minute for NYE. Ponzu restaurant (attached to hotel) was excellent for a romantic dinner (try the lemongrass steak and fried rice)! Top-rated Dottie's Cafe is just around the corner, and worth the wait for breakfast (awesome berry torte). While the hotel is on the edge of the Tenderloin district, we never felt like we were in an unsafe area, although there are many street people everywhere in SF, it seems. You are only 3 blocks from Union Square shopping, cable cars, etc. Other perks: free ethernet connection, mini-fridge, in-room safe, nice large LCD TV, free games to borrow from the lobby, free evening wine tasting. One caveat: the lobby was quite chilly from the frequent blasts of cold outside air whenever the door opened.One other word of warning--its true, Alcatraz tours sell out a week ahead, so buy tickets ahead or you'll be paying more to get them from a scalper or broker.You really don't need a car with all the transportation options, but the one day we rented a car to drive a little farther out, we took advantage of the free valet parking for hybrids (otherwise valet is $40, and garages nearby are 25-30/day). Would absolutely return here on our next visit to SF!"

The room was small, needed a thorough update, it showed its Victorian Style leaving us to believe we were in the Victorian era.The Shower was grotty, the taps grimy and after showering you still didn't feel clean. The window of the shower was also broken.We have never known a hotel to close its very popular restaurant for 2 nights, and the bar for 1 night.Sorry Beresford but I wont be staying with you again, and wouldn't recommend it."

We expected a small room but it was smaller than acceptable with only one bedside cabinet for what was supposed to be a double room. The phone was connected at the opposite side of the room and there was no clock/alarm. The room was very cold when we arrived and when we asked about heating we were told it can only be put on to heat the whole hotel. We got heating the following evening only.l No tea/coffee making facilities in the room either. The receptionist was rather abrupt and unfriendly. Good points were the hotel was clean, served a nice breakfast. had free internet connection for 15 mins at a time and handy for Union Square."

This was our first stay at the Hotel Bereford. The hotel had a great location and was very clean. The staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms were clean and small, but who needs alot of room when y ou don't plan on being it it much! Only problem I had was there was no air conditioner or screens on the large window. We were on the 7th floor and had to leave the window wide open all day and night to get some air flow becaue it was so stuffy. If we had a child this would have been a big problem because the window started about 3 feet up from the wall and anything could have fallen out it since there was no screen. Unfortunately it was a loud night in the city and we did not get much sleep with the windows open. A ceiling fan would have been nice. We came back from a show around midnight and went into the White Horse Tavern attached to the hotel. It was a very nice English style pub but was unbearably hot and stuffy also so we decided to have drinks in our room.I would go back to this hotel but only in the winter."
"Review_12092","hotel_137","hotel_9801","Jul 22, 2008","Good Value... My sister and I stayed here for a weekend last November. The first thing I thought when I walked into the hotel was that it had charm and character. It is unlike the usual hotel chains in the US, more like a place you'd expect to find in Europe. My sister and I were first assigned to a room on the first floor, which looked like it had not been cleaned yet and smelled a little funny. The bathroom appeared dirty and there were hairs on the pillows in the beds, which obviously did not belong to us as we had just checked in. We went to the front desk and told them about our room. They were apologetic and switched us to a room on the 2nd floor, which was much more nice, cozy, and more importantly, clean, compared to the last one. The hotel is in a great location, just a short walking distance to Union Square and some great shopping. I don't know that I would stay here again, the only problem I encountered was the cleanliness of the first room. Other than that, the stay was perfectly fine, the hotel staff friendly, and the continental breakfast good. Over all, it was a good value for the price, just make sure you get a clean room."

I can honestly say that the Beresford was the worst we had stayed in.Firstly, our room was freezing cold (as was the same with other guests on the same tour - especially the Queen Anne rooms) due to the bathroom window not shutting properly so had a hurricane blowing through making the whole room cold. The windows were glass shutters with a quarter of an inch gap in between each one of the panes. According to the reception staff all the Queen rooms were the same!!! After having spent a night in the room we asked to move as we couldnt cope with the cold.One particular reception staff was quite rude and abrupt whenever we complained about the room. Once we moved to a twin room, a huge difference, the room was lovely and warm.Appart from the problems, the hotel was centrally located and there was a free breakfast every morning.I for one though, would not be returning to the Beresford."
"Review_12096","hotel_137","hotel_9432","Mar 29, 2008","Excellent Value for Money We stayed for 3 nights in early March 2008. On arrival we were given a free upgrade to a suite which included kitchen (with honesty drinks in the fridge), dining area, living room area, 2 double beds and jacuzzi bathroom. It was fantastic. The hotel is victorian but had character. It was very clean and all staff were helpful. We had not expected breakfast so the coffee, pastries and fruit were a great bonus if you wanted to get out quickly. The wine and cheese were also enjoyable if you got back in time. There were 2 computers to use with free internet access (though no printing). The location was excellent, very near Union Square. For the price we paid it was extremely good value for money."
"Review_12097","hotel_137","hotel_5110","Mar 22, 2008","Great location, shame about the hotel... I have just returned from a week's holiday staying at this hotel. The location is fantastic, only a few minutes walk from Union Square and the majority of the staff are friendly and helpful. However, the rooms seem to be in need of repair- we stayed in two during our stay and the first had a broken television and window that wouldn't open whist the second had broken furniture, electric sockets that sparked when in use and a blind that fell completely off the wall in the middle of the night. While the rooms seemed clean there was a terrible smell of rubbish on our floor of the hotel (clearly from bins that had been left in the corridor after being removed from the bathrooms). The Beresford is also unfortunate enough to employ a couple of staff members who are rude, surly and completely unhelpful and are a discredit to those employees who were polite and accommodating to guests. Luckily we did not stay in the hotel much as we were out exploring for the majority of our stay, only returning late at night. But if you plan to spend a bit more time in your hotel then personally I would look elsewhere for accommodation. We will not be making a repeat visit."

"Review_12099","hotel_137","hotel_3558","Jan 22, 2008","good value for the price We stayed at the Hotel Beresford for 4 nights at the beginning of October. We booked far in advance which is a good thing since it was Fleet week.The hotel is very conveniently located if you are a tourist (as we were). The cable car is a 3 minute walk away and there are also buses running right past the hotel. Union Square is a short walk away and Chinatown is also within walking distance. There are lots of places to eat nearby. The hotel itself is good value for money. We were actually amazed to find such a reasonable place so close to the centre of town.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was medium sized and the bed was comfortable. We overlooked the back, so it was fairly quiet. But don't expect a view! The bathroom was OK, the minibar well stocked and not expensive and there was plenty of wardrobe space.Breakfast was served in the restaurant on the ground floor. This was quite ample by American hotel standards. Cereals, fruit, pastries, coffee - as much as you could eat from a buffet.There was a pleasant friendly atmosphere in the breakfast room with tourists from many countries, mostly of the 40-60 age group. Only thing we didn't like was the plastic cutlery and plates! This is something Europeans really have a problem getting used to.All in all, we found the hotel good value for money and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small friendly convenient place and doesn't expect luxury."

"Review_12101","hotel_138","hotel_9535","Dec 10, 2008","Not Bad But I've Stayed in Better This is a nice looking hotel not far from the airport. We stayed here for three nights while attending a family wedding and to get some quality time together.Check-InWe arrived at 9:00 p.m. after taking the shuttle bus from the airport. Unfortunately, only one person was working the front desk and a line quickly formed as there were ten of us on the bus. The sole person working moved fast and before we knew it, we were next.Unfortunately, the room we reserved (four months in advance) was not available. We had asked for a king sized bed with a view of the bay but were told the only thing available with a king sized bed was overlooking the parking lot. I asked for them to make that up in terms of rate but was told this was not possible as we had pre-paid for the room. No effort to make up for their error was made. We were told that our requested room would be available on our last night but we rejected that offer. Who wants to pack up and move to a different room for one night?At least the check-in person was polite. I can鈥檛 say that for some of the other staff but more on them later.RoomVery nice and it must have been recently renovated. The rooms all feature a huge flat screen television. The bathroom was nice and large with plenty of room. There were no scratches or dings of any kind in the bathroom or in the room itself. The bed, as always at Sheraton, was wonderful.We got our non-promised view of the parking lot. There was a coffee maker but our sole attempt at making any revealed that it didn鈥檛 make that great coffee. Even using spring water didn鈥檛 help.Not much in the way of storage or drawer space here. I think that was probably because most people only stay here for a night so not much would be needed.Housekeeping was fine. Plenty of towels left and the room kept spotless.Food and DrinksBig issues here. On our first night, we arrived at 9:00 as I mentioned. The hotel website showed that food was available there until 11:00 p.m. We were counting on this due to the late arrival of our flight. We arrived at the dining room right after check-in and were greeted by a sign telling us it was closed and to proceed to the lounge.We arrived at the lounge, took a seat at the bar and started reading menus. It was then that the bartender informed us that kitchen was closed as of 10:00. I looked at my watch and it showed 9:30. I then told him that I thought they were open until 11.He rudely responded that it was too late to order anything as the kitchen staff leaves at 10 and that he knew nothing about any 11:00 closing. Disturbed, we walked out of the bar without paying for the two draft beers had had poured for us when we sat down!My guess is that was quiet with food orders so they decided to close down early. I could tell from the bartender's face that what I had told him was correct.We then asked a staff member in the lobby where to eat. This guy suggested a restaurant that we had to take a taxi to. We remembered passing other hotels on the bus that were not far away. We took a walk down to the Red Roof Inn (around a 15 minute walk) and found a really good 24 hour diner. We ended up having breakfast there two morning and it was just fine. That place is good for both breakfast and lunch or a non-formal dinner.There is also a chop and steak house on the bay right behind the hotel. In the darkness, we could not see it on our first night but saw it the next morning and ate there on our last night. It was very good and highly recommended. I still wonder why the staff member we approached made no mention of that place but I am sure it was not an accident.The menu revealed pricy items so it was just as well that we avoided it after our experience the first night. The good news is that the hotel will give you a cup of fresh coffee for free. They don鈥檛 advertise this so just ask for one at the hostess station and they will accommodate you. One morning, that had a station all set up.Leisure ActivitiesThere is a pool here but I didn鈥檛 use it nor did I see it. Right behind the hotel, there is a walkway right along the bay. This is great for a daytime walk but it closes after dark. It offers nice views of San Francisco.Airport ShuttlePretty good and runs every 20 minutes or so. The bus is clearly marked. Good thing too as our driver when we arrived spoke English with a very heavy Chinese accent making him very difficult to understand. They will handle your luggage for you and the drivers were pretty polite.Overall Not a bad choice for a night or two. The rooms are very comfortable. The problem with the hotel is that it鈥檚 isolated and there isn鈥檛 much around. I sure wouldn鈥檛 recommend this place if you were staying for a week but a short stay or overnight is fine."

Ridiculous.3) Restaurant service was horrible.

The hotel has just been refurbished and is easy to find right off the 101. Plenty of parking, although you do have to pay $18 a night but its the same with all the hotels in this area.The rooms themselves were lovely - huge beds with fresh, comfy linens and pillows. An enormous flat screen TV set in the wall, refurbished bathroom and nice toiletries from Bliss.So the rooms weren't the issue here...unfortunately it was the front desk staff. I checked in and with barely more than a glance I was handed my keys. The lady then went straight back to her computer. I paused, hoping she would then go on to tell me where the lifts were and the usual things they tell you about when you check into a hotel (like check out time, breakfast etc). But no, I was left looking a little uncomfortable wondering where to go.After a minute of me still standing there a bit awkwardly, she looked up and said 'what?' I said, which way do we need to go and she, still tapping on her computer and not looking at me, directed me to the lifts. I'm not very fussy and I've stayed in plenty of hotels but I found this whole episode so rude and unfortunately put me off the hotel. The housekeeping staff, by the way, were lovely and always said hello and were quick and efficient when I rung down for some extra milk. It strikes me that all the big chain hotels are trying to dumb down guest/staff contact - I didn't even need to check out as my bill had been slipped under my door and my credit card charged. I was only directed to the key drop bucket by the front door - so no thanks for staying, how was your stay or anything like that. On a brighter note, room service was quick and delicious - and a much better option than Kincaids and Sizzlers down the road."

The door to our particular room got stuck, so you had to shove your body on it to close it. You had to pay for parking in their lot. You had to pay for internet in your room (although there was free wireless internet in the lobby of all places). Minus one nicer Asian gentleman, the staff at the desk were all unfriendly or unmotivated or both. There was no fridge in the room and the shower pressure was pretty terrible.

On the plus side, comfortable rooms, all the standard business facilities, good size bar/restaurant. Close to the airport, and close to Interstate 101, so handy for most places in the Valley.On the down side, the fitness centre is pretty small, and so is the pool. The aircon system in the room was very noisy; not sure if this is deliberate to drown out the planes!One big negative - if you have a car, it's 18 dollars for overnight parking.

After staying here many times, sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't.LOCATION-Nothing special! It's at the end of a street with really nothing around. There is one higher-end restaurant next door and a diner maybe 1/2 mile walk. You are pretty much stuck at the hotel. However, it is right on the water and there is a nice bike/jogging path that runs toward the airport.PROPERTY-Yes, this hotel was recently renovated. The lobby (esp. the front desk) is impressive and unique. It's sort of W-ish. The pool isn't so hot...only indoor on the 2nd floor. No outdoor patio area or anything.ROOMS-The rooms are definetly renovated and very, very nice. Very modern with flat-screen tvs, high-end bedding and a very nice desk. My bathroom had a drain that would not stay open. So most of the time I was standing in 2 feet of water. Annoying. Very, very, very nice Bliss toilitries that I really liked.SERVICE-They renovated the property, but not the staff! They aren't rude, just standard issue blah-ness. Their attitude doesn't match the beautifued property. No enthusiasm whatsoever.This place is fine, but I'd probably check out the Westin, Marriott, or Hyatt if you need an airport hotel. If you get a good deal and don't expect much in service, you'll be happy here."

You would have never known it was an airport hotel.We booked the hotel through Hotwire for something like $90.Stayed in the Starwood Preferred Guest floor rooms... The rooms were fantastic, newly renovated and included a big flat screen tv. Big sized with several amenities including a TV channel with all the flight information.The hotel is about a 10 min ride to the terminals... free shuttle available even at 4 am!If you've got an early morning flight in SFO, highly recommend staying here.Only negatives - $5 parking  the dizzying wall behind the front desk."

It was a beautiful place and my only regret is that we got there late and left early. The room was gorgeous - very modern styling, flat screen tv, wonderful amenities.

The bed was firm, sheets were nice and soft and pillows were soft but firm enough. Bathroom was clean and the complimentary toiletries are good quality. Hairdryer is a regular, 1875-watt and dries hair faster/better than the usual small, wall-mount hotel ones.Starbuck's coffee in room with a very nice desk/sitting area for working and really bright, cheerful with light let in by the large windows.Has a flat screen TV and is centrally located to highways and airport. Complimentary airport shuttle.I had a problem with the room service staff bringing my coffee at the wrong time and then the room service manager did not not want to bring me a fresh pot-- she quibbled with me over the course of 4 different phone calls, all over a $6 pot of coffee.The front desk person during the day was very lackadaisical and did not send up a staff person to clean my room when I asked her to, when I left for the day. I used the room to work and even though I hung a sign on the door, housekeeping staff knocked repeatedly and called the room to see if I was gone yet. So, my room was never cleaned and they said it was my fault because I was in the room during the day. I left around 3-4 in the afternoon, and I assume there was at least *one* housecleaning staff who could have made up the room and emptied the trash."

"Review_12124","hotel_138","hotel_4128","Feb 2, 2008","Unexpected WOW I booked this hotel for one night since I had an early flight out of SFO the next morning. When I arrived at the hotel it was 10:00 PM and I couldn't see much of the outside although it is located right on the water. I first noticed that the hotel is finishing its makeover so the lobby is a bit hidden.Upon checking in, I was given a preferred room on the 11th Floor. I will tell you that this room is one of the nicest I have EVER stayed in due to a recent renovation. It had a very large flatscreen TV with HD. The amenities and furniture were very modern and comfortable (including Sheraton's new Bliss line of bathroom amenities). They even had installed a complete technology box with multiple plugs for computers and a number of other gadgets. Although I didn't get to enjoy it, I will absolutely stay here the next time I need an airport hotel in San Fran.The most important thing to know about this hotel is that they run a complimentary shuttle to the airport 24 hours. Before 5 AM, they run every 30 minutes. After 5 AM, they run every 20 minutes.I can't tell you what the standard rooms look like, but the higher floors were incredible."

It was so loud that it sounded as though it was next door. I called the front desk and they said they would check on it and call me back. They never did. So, I called again and I was told that a disclaimer about noise was clearly visible on my hotel confirmation. It was not. I asked why I was not put on a lower floor, away from the noise, or even been given that option, and they said no rooms were available. LIE! The hotel was virtually empty as evidenced by the lobby, and the nearly empty parking lot. The restaurant had 2 people in it at 8:45 am. Instead of offering some sort of compensation, they offered repeated lies and extremely condescending and insincere apologies. They gave me a free continental breakfast. I honestly have had much better breakfasts at the Comfort Inn. Everyone was so unprofessional and disinterested in the guests, especially for a hotel that is supposed to be of a relatively high caliber. I think I'll chose JW Marriott next time."

I decided to find a hotel near the airport to get some sleep before hitting the road the next day. Found this place with a good price and location. Took the airport shuttle back to the hotel and checked-in. The lobby was nice, and front staff helpful. My room was nice and clean, with a view of the bay. I had a queen size bed and it was by far the most comfortable bed I've slept on. The sheets were soft, and the duvet plush, unlike most hotels which feel like sandpaper. After a good nights sleep, check-out was quick and the airport shuttle took me back to the airport so I could get my car rental. Overall, I'd definitely stay here again."

"Review_12129","hotel_139","hotel_2397","Dec 9, 2008","Would definitly stay here again. Great location. My husband and I travel frequently for pleasure and do not like having to pay more than about $150 a night. This place was a great bargain and if you check out their rates even without going 'Hotwire', they have some very fair prices. We stayed two years ago at a hotel nearby, it was $115 then, and that same hotel is now over $300 per night! Hotel Bijou was nicer, rooms were plenty big, extra pillows (sheets a little starchy, but clean and new), adequate closet space , extra pillows, and nice clean compact bathroom with quality toiletries and a great pleasant housekeeper to boot. Very accomodating - put us in a quiter room near the center of the building, when I asked for a room away from noise. (You don't want to be near the elevator by the way, it sounds way too noisy). Yes, of course there is street noise, sirens etc. this IS a major city after all and the up-side is that you are close to all the great restaurants, pubs, entertainments and transit to all over San Fran, including BART to the airport. The only suggestions I would make would be to add some fruit to the otherwise adequate breakfast and/or maybe some yoghurt. But it's FREE, and for those who just want juice, muffin, O.J and some flakes or instant oatmeal it's more than enough to hold you until lunchtime. Also, an extra shelf in the bathroom for personal stuff would be nice. We didn't need air conditioning because of the time of year, so outside noise was not much of a factor, besides they supply ear plugs. And yes like several other people suggested, stay away from the side street- the Eddy Street liquor store has some real chatty characters hanging around most of the day and evening, but they seem only interested in talking to each other....we never had a problem, as we always walked on Mason St towards Union Square and avoided that corner and that street in particular. Again, it's a major city and has it's fair share of street people and pan handlers like most others. Don't let it get in your way of having a great time, this is a wonderful city with lots of fun activities. If you like fun pubs, don't miss the piano bar at Lefty O'Douls just a short walk away. Lots of tourists but great fun."

We stayed here for two weeks: it was in a great location, very near union square, breakfasts were great and it was extremley clean.It is on the corner of tenderloin but we never had any problems, we always walked towards union square and we heard no noise in our room at night.It is very close to some great places to eat and the cable car stop which takes you all the way up to Fishermans wharf.The only downside is the price of the phone calles from the hotel. Our final phone bill was $350 and we only made about 8 phone calls. The internet cars are $10 for an hour but there is an internet cafe straight across the street which is $3.50 for 30 mins so is a lot cheaper.I would definately reccommend this hotel to anyone wanting to explore the city!!"

To our surprise the hotel was, although very centrally located, easy to find by car from the airport. There is no parking place at the hotel it self so you can choose from valet parking to other local parking places. Either way it costs al lot of money (expect 24-29 USD per 24 hours). That was the only downside.The hotel is very centrally located and a perfect start to explore San Francisco. The rooms are small but clean. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. We left very early ( 06:00 am)at the last day and we could make our own breakfast to take with us. Breakfast is good but simple.If you're looking for an average but very central accomodation don't hesitate."

The cinema theme is a great idea with San Francisco made films showing in their own cinema e.g. Dirty Harry, View to a Kill, although the jet lag meant we couldn't take full advantage. However, there were a significant number of loud street dwellers gathered outside the local liquor stores which meant almost contant noise apart from a short break around 4 - 5 a.m. There was no air conditioning and the windows needed to be permanently closed.To be honest, I expected more for the price we paid."

Breakfast is very basic, but there are some great diners very nearby, if you need some eggs or pancakes! My main negative comment would be the lack of air conditioning, as our room was very stuffy.

Yes, it is close to some of the dodgier areas but it is also close to Union Square and other, more accessible areas (you could tell where you should and should not go). We did have some problems: on our arrival at the hotel we were told that they did not have our booking鈥?Fortunately it was soon discovered but we were told that (despite it being 2.45 pm, with check-in at 3.00 pm) the room was not ready and asked to come back in an hour. After a 10 and a half transatlantic flight this is not really what one wants to hear. We returned after an hour and the room was still not ready. They did (eventually) assign us a room (directly next to the elevator shaft). Yes, there was some noise from the street (it being a busy city I expected it) but there was a construction site next door that started work early. It was clean and good as a base to explore the city."

This hotel is located close to Union Square, but also to a neighborhood that isn't very nice for tourists at all.The rooms are small, but okay if you'll only have to stay here for some days. There are no A/C in the rooms, which can be quite annoying since the hotel is heated constantly. The frontdesk staff is really helpfull and gives you good advises for nearly everything in and out of San Francisco.Be aware of the noise in the nighttime, since you have to sleep with the windows open. Dont know if we were unlucky, but we slept in two different rooms, one with windows to the street and the other with windows to the backyard, and both rooms where so noisy that we had to use the ear plugs that the hotel gives to you.The breakfast was nothing special, but it was free.Only two stars from me because of the noise in the nightime, making us sleep some hours in daytime, cause else you wouldt get sleep at all."

I was somewhat concerned about the pick after I read the reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised.No the rooms don't have A/C, yes, even in March it got stuffy and we would open the window. I loved the charm of the fire escape from one of our windows (lots of bird poop though). We were in a corner room which I understand is larger, but probably also noisier - much more so with the windows open. We didn't use the earplugs once... the noise didn't bother me. The rooms were clean and very adequate. There was an incident one afternoon across the street, several police officers had detained a woman that kept yelling Where's my crack pipe!? It was more comical than anything. However that does lead me to the fact that it is in a semi-questionable area of town. But in a group I felt safe. There are homeless people in all areas of SF, it was no different here. The breakfast was meager and carb laden --but free!. The coffee was nasty. They did have hard boiled eggs. The movies at night were OK (VHS TV surrounded by curtains), we watched one for 15 minutes and then got bored, but the night guy was super nice and even popped us microwave popcorn for the movie. In fact I found all of the staff to be very pleasant. Maybe you get what you give?We had a great stay, I loved the location so close to the cable car line and great shopping. For the price, I'd definitely stay again."

The Hotel is located right in Union Square and about a 1 minute walk to the BART. The rooms are very clean and the decor is cool. Very old Hollywood glamour. I really enjoyed my stay there. The staff was friendly and helpful.The only downside is it's a block away from the Tenderloin district which is very sketchy, and can get a bit loud outside. But I'm a city girl, so I'm not too bothered by it. However it might really bother some. So you might want to book a room away from the street."

We had booked 2 double beds but got a room with 1 double bed and no light in the room. I went back and got another room that ended up being 2 single beds. We settled with that for 6 nights. The ear plugs they supply were essential. We had asked for a higher room or a quieter one but eventually thought ourselves lucky to get one with 2 beds. Very very noisy, there are fire, police, and ambulance sirens going all night.Hot water for tea also cold. It wasn't even a cheap hotel, our travel agent must have pocketed a lot compared to the price of it and what we paid. The only positives: it was clean and a good central location."

All the patrons were getting angry because the hotel was over booked and they kept transferring patrons to this other hotel.The hotel overall was ok. The rooms are tiny and the facilities are average. From all the hotels that i have stayed in, I thought this hotel was out dated.The beds were so uncomfortable and not sturdy. The rooms were stuffySome sheets had holes in them!The rooms were also so noisy. The first room we got placed in was horrible. Word of warning do not get a room that faces Eddy Street. Try to get a room facing Mason Street.Our first room was on this street on the 3rd floor and all night to morning we heard loud music, drunks, gunshots, etc. It was horrible! We couldn't sleep. I was told by some locals that Eddy St is part of the dodgy part of town called Tenderloin (however spelt). I would recommend you stay away from this area.After complaints, a staff member Letica was very helpful and moved us to the 6th floor to room 600, which was less noisy and slightly bigger. However it was still noisy!The continental breakfast was boring.. only bagels and hard boiled eggs etc.. nothing great.Overall I would not partically recommend staying at this hotel. The service is not up to proper standard and the rooms itself are average.. The only thing going for it is the fact that it is close to shops.."

We got lucky with Hotel Bijou and a AAA rate of $117 for a Saturday night. I read the reviews and felt ok about booking it. We were not disappointed! The hotel is very clean and looks like the rooms were painted and updated not too long ago. The bathrooms are very clean and sparkling. The front desk people were very helpful and friendly. We were so close to Union Square, right behind the Hilton, but it's not as noisy as if you are right on Post. We did not hear any street noise from our room (212). They do provide ear plugs if you need them. The room, at first, felt small but really was not. The bed is right there when you open the door but there is plenty of room to move around and get ready. There is a closet inside the bathroom area. The bed was a bit hard for my boyfriend but good for me, I prefer a bit harder bed.The location is very good, just a block up and a block over to the main shopping and Union Square. It's very easy to get a cab from this location. We did drive up and had the car parked with the hotel at an adjacent parking garage (they provide valet for you) and you can leave your car until 6pm the day you check out so you can leave your bags with the hotel and go play in the City and pick your car up by 6 to drive home.I would definitely recommend this to friends and would stay here again."

From the moment we first arrived it was pretty much one bad experience after another..Firstly, we arrive at 3pm to be told our room is not ready and to come back in an hour..No drama..Off we go to get something to eat and one hour later arrive back to be checked in by some ditsy airhead who I heard mutter 'I don't have any double beds' (we were 2 females travelling and had booked a room with 2 doubles) but then continued to tap away on her keyboard for at least 5mins before handing us our room keys..I assumed she was finding our double beds..WRONG!! She didn't have the courtesy to advise us, but when we reached our room, it was 2 singles..And when we saw the earplugs on the bedside table, we knew it was going to be rough, but more about that later..We stayed in the room for one night and it was sorted the next day..The next morning at breakfast, I made a cup of tea and it was pretty much stone cold..I take a drop of milk with my tea and when the dining room attendant appeared, I asked if she could bring more hot water as my tea was cold..She looked at it and told me it was because I had added milk! I told her that the water should be boiling so that I can add milk and she proceeded to microwave me a cup of water..Two mornings later, there were no teabags left..I advised her of this, she looked into the empty cannister and just said 'There's no more tea'..not even an attempt to sound apologetic!There are 2 signs in the lobby advising the building contains chemicals that could cause cancer and abnormalities in unborn babies and to ask at reception for more information.We asked the ditz when we checked in and she looked at us puzzled as though she'd never laid eyes on these signs before and proceeded to tell us that alcohol contains chemicals that can be harmful to unborn babies..When we again said the sign is referring to the building, she again told us we shouldn't drink alcohol if we were pregnant!!! Yeah, whatever!!!!And then there's the noise...San Fran had record high temps when we arrived, and there is no air con but we couldn't even leave the window open for some fresh air because of the homeless and people hanging outside the liquor store and pizza place..Sat night was especially bad as the noise level was pretty much intolerable until 4am without our earplugs..The only positive I can say is that it's in a great location...But I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone as there are plenty of other hotels in the area that I will be looking at for my next stay..I will certainly never stay there again!!!!"

It was so close to convention center, which is why we were in San Francisco for my husbands business. I saw it was on the edge of the Tenderloin district but booked it anyway because union square and amazing shopping was only one block away. The hotel is also one block from the BART station and the trolley, which was a major selling point for me, because I was going to be alone during the day while my husband was working and wanted to see the city. The rooms were clean, and so was the bathroom. I was very impressed with the staff, they were very helpful. Our room was a bit small but it felt comfortable. The internet is not free, but we paid 8 dollars a day which was totally worth it because it was fast and secure through ATT. There was great shopping near by and great restaurants. The only things we didnt like, but were not the fault of the hotel was: Construction noise next door all day and on the weekend. The amount of homeless and panhandlers near the hotel. There was constant yelling and fighting noises at night that woke us up. A fire/police station which cause noise of ambulance/fire trucks and police sirens in the night. I understand that the hotel is in the middle of the city, and there will be noises due to that, but we felt that the noise outside really took away from the ambiance of the hotel inside. This hotel would be okay for a weekend stay or a few days, we were there for 6 nights and it was too long."

"Review_12152","hotel_139","hotel_6975","Feb 20, 2008","Way to Ruin a Weekend My husband and I booked two nights at the Hotel Bijou for our anniversary weekend. We used Travelocity, which gave us a great deal-- only $89/night, plus tax/fees and valet parking at $25/day. The first thing that wasn't as we'd hoped was the tiny, cramped room on the 5th floor. We're very familiar with SF boutique hotels, so I wasn't expecting a suite, but this was smaller than anything I'd seen before. There was also an overwhelming aroma of dirty shoes and unclean laundry in the hallways, which was less than stellar.However, the size of the room and locker-room scent was nothing compared to the bathroom issues. I washed my face with a towel, then set it on the towel rack, which promptly jerked out of the wall and landed on the toilet tank. I moved it off to the side and then proceeded to use the toilet, which-- of course-- overflowed within seconds. We called down to the front desk for help, and they sent up a plunger. The toilet was essentially nonfunctional, unless we plunged 3-4 times prior to using it and then 3-4 times after using it. When we called down to complain and ask for another room, the front desk said that they couldn't do anything because we'd booked through Travelocity. They did, however, offer to let us use the restroom in the lobby. Really? Thanks.Early the next morning, I called Travelocity. Thirty minutes later, the front desk manager (Jill) called and apologized. She moved us to a larger room on the 2nd floor, with-- ta-da!!-- a functional toilet. However, I don't recommend the 2nd floor, because it is so close to street level that the noise can be godawful on the weekends.On a positive note: The Bijou is extremely close to the shops, BART, museums (SFMOMA and Yerba Buena), restaurants, theaters, and clubs. It was just hard to feel positive after having to plunge my own toilet on my anniversary weekend. We definitely won't be returning. Ever."

There are no security locks on the rooms (just door handle locks), no wall outlets near the desk for your laptop. The wall lamps above the bed are mounted so low you cannot sit up in bed to read. Apparently the Bijou used to be part of the Joie de Vivre group of boutique hotels, but is no longer. It has not kept it up very well. It's cheap, but not a good value for your money."
"Review_12154","hotel_139","hotel_10608","Feb 18, 2008","Bijou is great for a low budget! I booked the Hotel Bijou for my boyfriend and I on a trip in October 2007 and we liked it. I had read the mixed reviews and decided to give it a try and lucked out! It's a great value for a low budget and located a block away from the BART station and the Powell Street Car. The hotel staff was great and gave wonderful recommendations of restaurants and attractions. Rooms were clean and exactly like the pictures. The negatives were that it was at the edge of the Tenderloin and the rooms were noisy (to be expected in Downtown San Francisco); however, I never felt unsafe. It was quaint, intimate, and the movie theatre was great! We were able to save money on our hotel and spend more on all the great attractions in San Francisco."
"Review_12155","hotel_139","hotel_5827","Feb 18, 2008","Good Value We decided to stay here because the reviews were pretty good, it was a Joie de Vivre property and because I found a rate of $88/night midweek on the Hotel Bijou website. Although the hotel is no longer a Joie de Vivire property, it was a perfectly adequate hotel in the Union Square area. The hotel was easy to find, it is near transportation and there are several parking garages in the vicinity. It is on the edge of a bad area and there is construction going on next door, but we weren't bothered by construction noise or the homeless. We did request a room on a higher floor because the noise from the street and the street people can be very loud. Also, like most homes and older commercial buildings in SF, there is no air conditioning. If you want a breeze, you open the window. On check-in, we were told we could have a larger room on the 2nd floor (apparently all rooms ending in -03 are corner rooms and larger than usual) or a regular room on the 6th floor. We went with the regular room and it was fine for two people. Everything was clean, if not fancy, and well maintained. One problem with the room was that the bed side lights were located on the wall above the headboard. My tall partner kept bumping his head into the lamp shades when he sat up in bed. One other odd thing was that although there was a terrycloth bath mat for our first day in the room, we were never given another one, so we just used a hand towel as a bath mat. We could have called housekeeping and gotten a bath mat. We didn't, so it was clearly not a big deal for us.The employees were friendly and helpful. We didn't try the free breakfast or the movies offered in the evening, so I can't speak to those services. Overall, this was a great hotel for the price. It is a budget hotel and I would have felt disappointed if I had paid over $120 a night. I also would have been disappointed if I was expecting a fancy or romantic ambiance. At $88 per night, for a clean room, I felt like I got a deal (hence 4 stars, rather than 3)."
"Review_12156","hotel_139","hotel_5514","Feb 1, 2008","Not enough Joie at the Bijou Was in San Francisco consulting for a budget conscious client and had high hopes for the Hotel Bijou. Seems it was a Kimpton Hotel in a prior life that has been taken over by Joie de Vivre - both boutique brands I really like. Pluses - great rate $109 including internet access. Typical Kimpton/JdV style - the rooms have funky furnishings and they play movies in the lobby.What I got was a smallish room with decent furniture and workspace. The bathroom had a full size tub, but it was kind of stuck in behind the sink like it was added later. The linens weren't worthy of a Days Inn circa 1988 - thin, see-through towels and sheets that felt like they were waterproof (must have had a threadcount of about 8 or so). No in-room coffee (a pet peeve), no newspapers available at all.The free breakfast was convenience store special - pre-wrapped bagels and pastries (couldn't they at least throw out some fruit?).The staff was nice, accommodating, friendly, except the night guy who was too busy with his laptop to pay much attention to customers.The topper was coming back on night 3 to find three police officers in the lobby, one holding a shotgun. Never got the scoop on that, but wasn't the best thing to come home to.Probably adequate for real bargain hunters. For a business trip, not so much."

The photos on the web site are NOT the same hotel room that I booked. I initially booked a 4 nights stay and left after only 1 night. I saw the photos on the web site and then called the manager to see if the hotel had actually been upgraded. He said yes and then made a reservation. After changing rooms twice I settled for the 3rd room. It was totally disgusting...dirty, smelly and just filthy. There is no air conditioning, so the manager gave us a fan to use. You could not open the windows because there is no security, its loud and the chain on the door could not be fastened. What irritated me the most is that the photos on the website are staged and absolutely no rooms look like that. I went to IHOP the next day and found that you could book this flea bag hotel for $74. with a coupon from a hotel coupon book. Best advice...stay away."
"Review_12172","hotel_140","hotel_6908","Apr 22, 2008","Excellent service Finishing our 16 days trip through California, we looked for a not too expensive hotel in San Francisco. Free parking and breakfast was a must, which makes it not that easy within the City. We came across the Presidio Inn in an advert and booked a room for three nights at a price that was very good. The Room was very nice and clean and the location within the City is good. You can walk to the Wharf and other places, but the bus stop for the Wharf is just at the next blok. We were told that the management had changed recently and compared with other comments I've read after returning to Denmark I must say that the new management do what they can to upgrade the previous negative comments - so give them a chance.The only thing we would mention, which unfortunately can't be upgraded, is to realize that a hotel placed in the centre will have some traffic noise.During our stay we got a message from back home that my wifes mother had passed away. We would like to express our thanks to the mangement for his excellent service by helping us with computer access, so that we could get in touch with the family. Why mention this - is that really so important? To us this service was, as we had spent nearly a day in the City looking for an internetcaf茅, which seem to be very rare in San Francisco, and even the AAA refused to help us in this difficult situation!"
"Review_12173","hotel_140","hotel_9506","Mar 28, 2008","Verified Great! A girlfriend and I wanted a getaway for a weekend, but on a budget. After 4 days of constant internet searches, we came across the Presidio Inn, and the Update review that precedes this one. On a chance, we took it for truth, made a reservation for one of our two nights, and set off for San Fran, fingers crossed.  Thank goodness we did! It was great! We made mention to Vee, the manager, that we'd seen a positive review and took a chance and he made sure that our stay not only warranted another good review, but truly went out of his way to ensure a fantastic weekend for us. We ended up with a two-bed room, rather than a one, which was above all the most important thing when it comes to traveling on a budget: CLEAN. We're both picky in that department, but even with inspection, bathroom, kitchenette, and beds all passed.  It was really Vee who made the difference. He answered all our questions, from sightseeing to restaurants, and made such an impression that we booked there again our second night, driving back from Sonoma and Napa to stay where we knew it was good. We paid less than any other hotel we'd seen- and have I mentioned the location was phenomenal? And free parking!! (unheard of, as far as we could tell) so we left our car and enjoyed the wharf without the hassle of finding/paying for parking. It's literally down the road from Ghiradelhi Square and the entire Marina, which makes for a fantastic walk. We even stopped in at a corner bar on the way back, paying remarkably reasonable prices for a few drinks (it was more a local pub than a tourist place) but hey, I'd rather drop a 5 than a 20 any day.  To be honest, the only (not negative, but) thing to be aware of while staying at Presidio Inn is the noise factor: it's located in a large city, and the walls are not soundproof to say the least. Coming from LA, city traffic is like a bubbling brook to us, but if you need absolute, impenetrable silence, bring earplugs. The walls are a bit thin, but unless you get stuck with disrespectful neighbors (if you do, call down to Vee; he took care of it for us :) you'll be fine.  In the end, I must recommend you disregard the negative surveys  reviews: they were from a different time, different manager. Presidio Inn was a great stay for an amazing price,  I will definately be back!"
"Review_12174","hotel_140","hotel_10483","Mar 16, 2008","Update We booked this hotel based on a travel website but almost cancelled when we started reading old reviews. We're glad we decided to check it out first. I'll be honest though, the room we were in looked nothing like the rooms on the hotel website. BUT, they were comfortable and CLEAN. The management has recently changed at the inn and the new guys are doing there best to make improvements. We had better service at this place than we have had at the larger, high-scale places in town. The building is old and needs some work, but they are actively making improvements and will continue to do so until it has all been upgraded. I highly suggest giving this place a shot. It's a good bet for your money and the management will do whatever is necessary to make your stay enjoyable. They definitely have our business."
"Review_12175","hotel_141","hotel_2220","Dec 8, 2008","Thanksgiving treat My boyfriend and I stayed here Thanksgiving night. We had dinner at Michael Mina, an overpriced restaurant at Westin St. Francis. Our 15th floor room at the Grand Hyatt had a view of Union Square. We could see the holiday lights and decorations, as well as the ice skaters in the Square. The room was a little crowded because of the two double beds (error I made while booking). There was no nightstand on the outer edges of the two beds. The bathroom was fine, though I was surprised there was no shower gel provided. Instead they had toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, bar soaps, and lotion. The fluorescent bathroom light hummed annoyingly.Another bad thing--coffeemaker in the bathroom does not come with coffee. You have to PURCHASE the coffee from the in-room Refreshment Center. Lame. There is a Starbucks across from the hotel, though.We skipped valet parking and instead left the car in the Sutter-Stockton garage, which is diagonally across from the hotel at the corner of Sutter and Stockton. Much cheaper.In the morning I appreciated the free SF Chronicle outside our door. I like it better than USA Today.We live locally, so when we can get away from work, we sometimes come to SF because it's only about 45 minutes away. If you stay in Union Square, there's always something to do. It's less arduous than going all the way to wine country or the Monterey area when you have just one day off."

"Review_12181","hotel_141","hotel_10315","Nov 19, 2008","Enjoyable stay Having read mixed reviews on Trip Advisor we were a bit unsure about staying at the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights in September but from the moment we arrived our worries disappeared.The hotel is in a great location just off Union Square, and stops for trams and streetcars are just a few minutes walk away. We booked a Regency Club King which was on a high floor and had excellent views of the financial district. The room was a bit smaller than expected, but the bed was extremely comfortable and the facilites were fine. Having access to the Regency Club Lounge was great. The views from there were even better than from our room - you could see the Financial District, Union Square, Coit Tower and the Bay. We enjoyed the complementary continental breakfast each morning and appetisers each evening. All soft drinks, tea and coffee were also free, only alcoholic drinks had to be paid for and given that it was a hotel, prices were reasonable. The staff in the lounge were welcoming and friendly.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in San Francisco and did all the usual touristy things, our particular favourites were biking the bridge with Blazing Saddles (we went as far as Sausalito), visiting Alcatraz and drinking lots of excellent champagne at Domaine Chandon during our day trip to Sonoma and Napa. We also enjoyed a delicous steak dinner in classy surroundings at Alfred's Steakhouse."

There was no sundries store (you had to walk to a nearby Walgreens), the mini-bar was one of those that charges you instantly if you remove something, so if you want to read a bottle of vitamin water, you get charged, the TV was mediocre, the phone didn't work, and there was no wired Internet connection. Internet services is $9.95 a night (via tMobile). Room service menu is very very limited.The best thing about the hotel is the location in the heart of union square, about 5 blocks from Moscone. The sky bar is pretty nice as well, but next time I'll stay at the Hilton."

The room I got was right across from the vending machines, so the noise was a factor, and my room was quite small. It seemed more like a european size to me. However the room was well appointed, and besides the tiny black and white TV in the bathroom, the room was fine. It does seem a bit dated with no flat screens and a bw!The bed was fantastic and the bar on the top floor was great with wonderful city views. One thing that did seem excessive was the valet parking fee, which was over $60 but I guess that is the price you pay for staying in Union Square."
"Review_12184","hotel_141","hotel_5883","Nov 8, 2008","Dodgy start but turned out ok... I visited this hotel in October 2008 for 4 nights. It was my first time to San Francisco and I was travelling alone. I had sat on tripadvisor for weeks beforehand as I just didn鈥檛 know which hotel I should book. I kept reading review after review and in the end I just took a chance and booked the Grand Hyatt, despite some of the bad reviews.I arrived at San Francisco airport and got a taxi to the hotel. Tip 鈥?Only get in yellow meter cabs, which will be waiting outside baggage claim. Do not go with the drivers that stand and offer their services for a fixed price. They will rip you off and often don鈥檛 have taxi licenses. When we pulled up at the hotel I paid the driver what was on the meter. He then said there was an extra $2 airport fee. I wasn鈥檛 really thinking at the time and I just paid it. When I got out of the cab I asked the receptionist if this was right and they said no. You only need to pay what鈥檚 on the meter. So please please please do not fool for this like I did! Also, the driver was very surprised when I only tipped him a dollar and muttered something rude in Spanish. I don鈥檛 really see the need to tip a taxi driver anyway unless they have provided an exemplary service. That goes for everything in America and as an English person I think it is quite frankly a disgrace the way a lot of Americans behave with the tipping system. I couldn鈥檛 give a monkeys that service is not included. People should only be tipped if they have really earned it.Anyway now on to the hotel! I had booked a Regency Club King which is a high floor room with a king bed, 鈥榣uxury鈥?bath amenities and access to the Regency Club Lounge. Oh and lets not forget you are on a private floor so you have to use your key card in the elevator to access it 鈥?This is really just for insecure people who like to look important when they are in an elevator. The receptionist was friendly and I was escorted by the bellboy to my room. When I got to the room, there were two queen beds in it and like I said I had booked a Regency Club King. I went back downstairs and asked what this nonsense was all about. I was told that unfortunately they did not have any regency club rooms with king beds and that it was the only thing they could offer me. She tried to make out that a king bed is not guaranteed to which I replied 鈥?Why are you advertising something you can鈥檛 produce? I.e. False advertising. Well I鈥檓 not a mug so I asked to see the manager. She tried it on as well until I was about to leave and check-in to the Westin St. Francis instead 鈥?at which point she was able to find me a king bed on a high floor with a view of the financial district which is what I wanted. It wasn鈥檛 however on the regency club floor which meant I wouldn鈥檛 get to use my key card in the elevator. Big loss! I did however make sure that the robes and 鈥榣uxury鈥?bathroom amenities were sent to the room as I was still paying for a Regency Club Room. By the way in case you are wondering, all rooms in this hotel are exactly the same. You just get a few extra luxuries in a regency club room and access to the lounge.I entered the room and I was pretty happy overall. The room itself was a pretty standard Hyatt room. You would think they would have flatscreen TVs for the price you are paying and the day and age we live in but no obviously not. Again, this didn鈥檛 really bother me. It was only a place to stay but the room was very presentable and well decorated I thought. There was an ipod port on the bedside table which was a nice touch and there was plenty of drawer and cupboard space. The bathroom is what I am always most concerned about in a hotel room but it was very clean and welcoming. The shower pressure was good and I didn鈥檛 encounter the problem of lukewarm water, which is often reported on here. If I wanted boiling hot water, that鈥檚 what I got. This was a relief as the frequent comments about this had worried me a little.One of the reasons why I also booked this hotel, was because it had windows that opened onto a small balcony and I can鈥檛 stand hotel rooms with windows that don鈥檛 open. I stayed in a skyscraper hyatt once with no windows and you just don鈥檛 get any oxygen in the room. It鈥檚 awful if you are spraying deodorant and hairspray or aftershave. How are you supposed to air the room? The air conditioning?! Do me a favour. Anyway I called the hotel before I booked it to make sure that the windows do open. I was told by the front desk that they open to about 4 inches, and if you want them open fully you need to sign a release form as they have had a couple of suicides in the past apparently. This sounded good except when I arrived I was told that this is not the case anymore and hasn鈥檛 been for the last year and you are only allowed to have the windows opened to the 4 inch mark. This wasn鈥檛 great to be honest and I was pretty annoyed as I was told something completely different. It also seemed ridiculous to have a balcony you can鈥檛 even use. You may think I鈥檓 a very picky person but when you are paying this sort of money, you have every right to be picky.I had a view of the skyscrapers of the financial district and the view really was spectacular, especially at night with all the buildings lit up. It really was wonderful and one of the great things about this hotel is the views you get from all the rooms, especially on a high floor.I had paid to have breakfast each morning in the Grandviews restaurant on the 36th floor. This really was spectacular to eat breakfast and look out over the whole of San Francisco. Probably one of the highlights of the hotel. The breakfast itself was very good. It is a small buffet but not too small. Plenty of choice. The 鈥榝resh,鈥?orange juice they offer you is clearly from a carton and I would expect freshly squeezed in a Hyatt and for the price I was paying. They also bring you a complimentary small glass of a strawberry smoothie each morning, which for the record, is also from a carton. The breakfast staff are very nice. Can be a little too talkative at times when you want to eat your breakfast in peace but I guess I should just lighten up a little.The staff overall in this hotel are absolutely superb. I was extremely impressed with all the staff here. Everyone will greet you with a smile on their face, and all the staff are extremely courteous and helpful. This was very nice to see. The concierge are fabulous at this hotel and they really cannot do enough for you. Probably the best concierge I have ever come across and I travel a lot. This was very refreshing and extremely impressive. The Regency Club Lounge is really nothing special. It is a small room on the 32nd floor and although the views are great, it鈥檚 not a very impressive room. They do a continental breakfast each morning which is ideal if you haven鈥檛 paid for the breakfast in the Grandviews restaurant. The hors d鈥檕euvres they serve in the evening are pretty poor. Just a small buffet area of poorly presented crudit茅s, brocolli thrown in a bowl, dumplings and a few other random bits. It all just looks like left overs from dinner and I鈥檓 pretty sure it is. There is also a bar area but you do have to pay for alcoholic drinks. All soft drinks are free which was handy for me as I could get a bottle of water whenever I wanted.I did not sleep well at all in this hotel. At about 8 o鈥檆lock every morning there was a clicking noise that came from something in the room. It was extremely annoying and there was no way I could sleep with that noise. It sounded as though it was the air conditioning unit cooling down but I didn鈥檛 ever even use the air conditioning unit. Luckily I needed to get up around that time anyway so I didn鈥檛 bother complaining. The beds themselves are not bad at all. They are not the most comfortable I have ever slept in but they are definitely comfortable enough.Be very careful when checking out of this hotel and read through the bill very carefully! They will try and charge you for the minibar even if you haven鈥檛 used it. I guess they do this just to cover themselves. They were very relaxed about taking it off the bill so it was pretty obvious they do it all the time.I would probably stay somewhere else next time just to try something different. My experience here was good overall. It has its good points and bad points but I cannot justify the money I paid for it. I think I will try the Fairmont next time as it really did look spectacular and there is not much difference in the price.In terms of restaurants, I wouldn鈥檛 bother with the Grandviews restaurant for dinner. The food does not get great write-ups and the prices are absolutely insane. You are just paying for the view. If you want to see the view then pay for breakfast in there. Wouldn鈥檛 you rather say you went to a famous Wolfgang Puck restaurant for dinner than saying you went to the Hyatt for dinner? Trust me it鈥檚 the same price. Avoid the local Daily Grill restaurant down the street. The hotel recommends this but my steak in there was absolutely appalling even though it is a steak restaurant. I went to the Cardonian Room restaurant which is at the top of the Bank of America building (2nd tallest building in San Francisco). The views are stunning and the food is ok 鈥?very small portions. I like nouveau cuisine but this was too small. Do go on the Movie Tour if you get a chance. It鈥檚 a lot of fun. You鈥檒l be sick of the voice of the tour guide after 3 hours and hearing about what films they have been extras in etc, but it is all good fun. Some great films have been filmed in San Francisco. Obviously do Alcatraz. You鈥檇 be stupid to go there and not to it. Was extremely fascinating. Get on the boat and go across to Sausalito. Very pretty town and nice to go there for lunch. The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen and if you like walking, do walk across it as the views are stunning. I would recommend taking the hop on hop off city tour on your first day to get your bearings and see a few of the sites. You needn鈥檛 waste money getting taxis around this city. Everything is close-by and it鈥檚 very easy to jump on a tram which will only cost you just over a dollar. Anyway if you have any questions, do not hesitate to send me a message."

I was here for a business trip, and the company sprang for a corner room on one of the upper floors, giving me a gorgeous view of Union Square and the rest of San Francisco. The bed was the perfect blend of firm mattress and soft sheets, the bathroom was huge, and I got a copy of the San Francisco Chronicle every morning. The staff here is amazing...everyone always has a smile on, and there's always at least five people waiting to help you with your bags, opening the door, or getting you transportation. This place even has a gym, so I didn't have to hike to the nearest 24-hour Fitness on Montgomery. Only thing was that the internet was $10 a day, but I found that having to pay for internet is the norm among SF hotels. If I could afford this place, I'd definitely stay here when I'm in town for fun."

With all the hype of the reception lobby we expected more in our room. The furniture was very dated and worn, the shower curtain had mould half way up and the windows were so dirty that you could hardly see out of them. As this was our first trip to the US we were really looking forward to 1st class treatment but as tourists we felt as though we were lower class. The restaurant was nothing special and very expensive. There was a folder in our room with examples of the menu but when we went for a meal nothing that was in the folder was on offer. We left our video camera for about 1/2 hour while we went shopping and when we came back someone had wiped it but the hotel is believing staff rather than us."

"Review_12189","hotel_141","hotel_1108","Oct 5, 2008","Great sisters weekend in San Francisco-couldn't want better Stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square with my sister for a fabulous weekend 9/25/08-9/29/08. It is conveniently located close to Union Square shopping, the Mason St cable cars and the streetcars on Market down to the wharf. The hotel was very nice. The accomodations were clean and comfortable. There was individual air/heat control in the room-not one of those awful noisy wall units. The concierges were amazing. They knew the best ways to get around. They recommended a wonderful Hop-on/Hop-off tour of the city with the tickets good for two days at a very reasonable price. They recommended a fabulous little Italian restaurant Fino about 2 blocks walk away and made the reservations for us. They had an appropriate solution to any question or challenge we presented them. They went above and beyond the call of duty in all things. The staff in the breakfast area were very accomodating also and made sure our needs were met in a timely manner. Housekeeping was superb-when asked to bring an extra towel, they were there within 10 minutes. I would certainly stay in this wonderful hotel with this fabulous staff again. As a matter of fact, I am trying to talk my husband into a trip there next year. The beds are comfortable with down comforters and plenty of pillows for all tastes.We were hesitant based on some of the previous reviews. Once we realized that some of these reviews were 3 to 4 years old and when we saw the hotel and the quality of the service, we were sure we made the right choice."

"Review_12193","hotel_141","hotel_7048","Sep 28, 2008","Speaking of pigs and lipstick... I was extremely disappointed with my stay here, so much so that I left after one night. I paid for the Regency Club level, which is a Concierge Suite that used to be the rotating restaurant at the top. The food in the suite was not plentiful, not especially tasty and definitely not filling. Much better at the Marriott and the Hilton.Although my room had some nice design elements (t.v. IN the bathroom mirror, lovely shower stall), there were far more detriments:- I asked for a quiet room. Noise from Market street even up on the 16th floor kept me awake, especially a thumping bass from who knows where.- I love a dark hotel room, but the phone on the desk had such a short line that I couldn't see any of the labels, couldn't move it close enough to a light.- Bedding was new and very stylish, but the bed was saggy. No bedbugs or signs of them, which is good.- Water pressure was weak and the shower wouldn't get hotter than lukewarm.- Main t..v. installed so that if you move the t.v. in the slightest, it unplugs itself. Cranky maintenance guy says he gets 10 calls a night. Plus they fixed the t.v. so that you can't pull it all the way out for comfortable t.v. viewing AND several of the major stations had lots of snow and white lines (how do you even do that with cable?).- I phoned for help when I couldn't find the concierge lounge (it had moved since my last stay there). Help was very unhelpful, treated me like I was an interloper when a simple instruction would have saved us all a lot of bother. Like most of San Francisco, customer service at the Hyatt is generally bad. SF Financial District Hilton much better at this.- As I had a prepaid visit via hyatt.com, I asked the front desk if I could leave a day early and still get my money back. They made me call reservations line, who told me it was up to the front desk. I called the front desk back, and he refused to believe he was wrong, and when I said but if you won't give me my money back and reservations won't give me my money back, who will? he said only that someone will. I'm anticipating having to go through my credit card company to get my $300+ dollars back.- Back when they filmed some interiors of High Anxiety, they had REAL plants hanging down the lovely interior cascade walls. Now they have a few fake plants, and it looks awful. - Ventilation/air conditioning is weird--at 6am I got someone cheap cologn/deodorant smell pumped into my room. What the?I work across the street from this hotel, but even in another work emergency, will pay whatever it takes to stay anywhere else. It clearly suffers from maintenance neglect, and slapping a little lipstick (fashionable bedding and furniture) on this won't make it a five star hotel. Inferior by far to the Financial District Hilton or even its sister hotel the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego."

Standard additional charges too, for internet, telephone, etc. etc. etc. Our room on the 17th floor was clean, nicely furnished and adequate in all respects, particularly at the price point we got from Priceline Negotiator ($117+tax = just under $142 for a Saturday night). The hotel is very close to Union Square, but if you鈥檙e a walker it鈥檚 still within striking distance of the waterfront and most other parts of downtown. Didn鈥檛 try the restaurant, but the sunset view from the lounge on the 36th floor is definitely worthwhile.Be sure to plan your budget to include parking if you鈥檒l need it. Expect the bums-rush in front of the hotel when you arrive, unless you'll accept valet parking at $49.50/day. Don鈥檛 be cowed though - You can offload your bags in front and then self-park in the exact same garage kitty corner across Stockton from the hotel for about $26/day!"

What made this hotel so amazing though on top of it being very very nice were the staff.Liz on Concierge was fantastic. We had been warned that there were always long waits for booking on Alcatraz. Liz got us on one within 6 hours, booked us on it over the phone and we were put straight to the front of the queue when we got there so there was no wait for us at all whereas others had had to wait a couple of days for a ticket and then had to queue for a long time once they got there.

The room was more than adequate and the beds were superb. The bathroom was clean, nothing special really, but it was functional with nice soaps/shampoos and plush towels. The housekeeping staff were right on top of the little requests we made with a note and a tip. Our room was very quiet and we were on the 4th floor (requested a low floor). The location though makes this hotel. It is about as central as you can get in SF. Walk anywhere and everywhere. Need a Walgreens? Right there. Lori's Diner? Right there. Union Square shopping. Westfield Centre. Virgin Megastore. Coffee, Burritos. Sushi. Pasta. Everywhere! Just a great location for a short visit to San Francisco. If you have higher expectations, try the Ritz Carlton or the Omni. Otherwise, this place is right on par for the money in a major US city. A good value for an active and adventuresome traveler who wants some amenities when they come back from a long day scaling the hills of San Francisco."

The hotel and room were clean and well maintained. My room was quite spacious and had an outstanding view. Club level extras included a robe and access to the 32nd floor lounge. The mini TV in the bath had very poor reception and couldn't be watched. The continental breakfast buffet in the lounge was only fair.The room had two upholstered chairs that were only fair for comfort, but room lighting was excellent. The TV was conventional, probably about 26-inch. The program list in the guest info book didn't match the actual channels and there was no PBS channel, although one was listed in the book.Windows are not double-paned and street noise was very noticeable at night. Voices from the street were so clear on the 33rd floor that I thought the window must be open--it wasn't. Otherwise the room was quiet.The bath was relatively small, but a large counter just outside the bath provide lots of storage space. The shower head over the tub had gaps in the spray pattern.The location on Union Square is outstanding.Valet parking at $49, almost $56 with tax.This is a large 4-star hotel that could give more attention to some details. I don't know how the parking charge compares with other SF hotels."

"Review_12206","hotel_141","hotel_10362","Jul 29, 2008","It was OK We recently visited San Francisco and stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. This is a centrally located hotel very close to everything, one block from the Cable Car, and shopping is all around you. Upon Check in, one of our two rooms was ready so we placed all of our luggage in that room and hit the streets of San Francisco. When we returned, the other room was ready so we got our key and moved in. The hotel in general was in good shape. This is a big convention hotel so not really geared for families. No Pool, Game Room, or place the kids could hang out. The rooms are small but well furnished and the bathroom was standard size. The two thing that I hate to see in a hotel bathroom is hair from the previous guest and black mildew in the shower. This bathroom had both. I quickly rinsed the hair away before my wife saw it. Since we were only staying here one night we both agreed that the mildew would not cause us to make a room change. Mildew around the tub is not what you expect to see at a Hyatt. The guest services people were great giving us directions and maps as well as family friendly places to eat. When I return to San Francisco to get back my heart, I will most likely choose the Grand Hyatt."

"Review_12208","hotel_141","hotel_6718","Jul 23, 2008","Definitely look for discounts when staying here It was a toss up between the Westin San Francisco Market Street and the Grand Hyatt. The Westin had a guaranteed awesome view and a nicer room but was slightly more expensive, Hyatt had a AAA discount that included a breakfast buffet (Valued at $50 for 2 people). Opted for the Hyatt due to the price and breakfast. The breakfast buffet was a delicious and located on the 36th floor of the hotel with an awesome view. The other plus was the location of the hotel directly next to Union Square. Unfortunately we got a room on a very low floor with a view of the air conditioning equipment on the building next door. The walls were paper thin and we could hear the very passionate couple next door like they were in our room. The room was clean, but the fridge is a touch sensor based minibar and there is no room in it for storing leftovers from restaurants. If you need a nice very clean and well made room for a couple days and don't plan to spend all your time in the hotel I would recommend this hotel, especially with the AAA discount. I probably won't come back to this hotel though."
"Review_12209","hotel_141","hotel_6982","Jul 16, 2008","Good location, Not so good service My husband and I recently stayed here for a wedding so we did not have a choice in choosing the property, but were pleased with the location and the reviews did not look terrible. We may have been biased since we moved over here from the W Hotel, which was a completely different experience for many reasons, the most important of which was - Service, Service, Service. The Grand Hyatt needs to learn that the customer is always right and I am not one to complain to hotel staff but when you feel they are pulling one over on you it is a little hard not to complain. We paid extra for the Club level room but were not given one. When I complained, all they did was offer to refund me and take away access to the Club Lounge. So we stayed with the regular room and kept the club access. I didn't think in the end it was worth the $50. They had very light appetizers and a tiny breakfast in the morning. You could buy drinks in the evening - for $50 you think they could afford one or two free drinks? Our room was disappointing, I saw rooms on the Club level that were much nicer. The shower was terrible. No amenities to speak of. The 36th floor bar has nice views, but awful service, We waited forever for drinks and refills and food, unfortunately. I guess if you want location and views, go for it, but don't expect to get high-quality service. We usually stay in Starwood properties and are never disappointed. This venture into Hyatt did no sway us one bit!"

You can walk to all of the shops and restaurants in Union Square with no problem. Their Valet parking was expensive but there is also a parking garage directly across the street from it were you can park pretty resonably. The rooms were nothing special, ours seemed quite small, which I expected from SF, but the bed was comfy and furniture wasn't shabby. You can barely open your slider door 6 in which annoyed me but I was told they do it for safety reasons. The absolute best part of the hotel was the restaurant on one of the top floors. It has a 180 degree view of San Francisco with floor to ceiling windows. My boyfriend and I received complementry buffet breakfast with our booking (usually $50/ person). The buffet was excellent, they had a pretty good selection and everything was very fresh. They had the best french toast I've ever tatsed!

The front desk gentleman was very nice. We went to our room that had a view of the city and partial water. The window opened to a concrete rail and then straight drop down eleven stories. The lock on the window did not work and my husband pointed out that spiderman could break in. . . The first thing I noticed when I walked in the room was that the carpet had large, dark stains throughout. I expect more from a hotel of this rating and this price.The bed was firm and comfortable, with a duvet and soft sheets. The flat screen tv was a good touch.I agree with a previous reviewer's comment about the faucet. I had to use a tissue to turn it on and off.The main problem with this place is the price for what you're getting. Across the board everything is pricey. I paid $18 for oatmeal room service.The downstairs bar had terribley slow service and poured vodka like it was molasses.

"Review_12213","hotel_141","hotel_9747","Jun 21, 2008","Great location; not much atmosphere I'm rating this hotel four stars mostly because it IS nicer than those to which I usually give three, but I do so somewhat begrudgingly. Actually there is quite a bit not to like.Let's start with the positives: Superb location at Union Square, so close to absolutely everything and easy to get everywhere you want to go. Great shopping and sightseeing nearby. The rooms are large and reasonably well furnished. I had a corner room, which the front desk said is larger than some of the other rooms, so you might try requesting one of those as a special request or an upgrade if you are so inclined. Front desk and staff were helpful and friendly. The restaurant and bar at the top have a great view, but I didn't try the food so cannot comment on that. Negatives (or not-so-positives): It's a typical, run-of-the-mill, large, urban Hyatt convention hotel. There is no style or charm to speak of. It's very pricey, and you're not getting luxury accomodations. While the funishings were fine, a couple of the lamps in my room were dinged up and cheap looking--surprising for a room in this price range. Because it has so many rooms, at peak times the elevators run really slow. I was surprised at how much sound I could hear through the door and walls. Fortunately, there were no partiers. Basically, you are staying here because your company has a contract with Hyatt, you are building up your Hyatt points, your convention is here, or you are from out of town and you recognize the Hyatt name and figure it's a safer choice than all those other San Francisco hotels you have never heard of. If you'll look around, you likely will find other hotels with as good a location for the same or less money that will be much more interesting."

This simple request was a major issue - apparently they only have one pair of scales in the entire hotel. I suggest that the hotel management cross the road to Macy's and buy 5 more weighing scales as many travellers need to weigh their luggage. If you can't afford the Four Seasons, which in my opinion would be the ultimate San Francisco hotel, I would stay here. I would recommend this hotel to my friends."

I lived in SF for several years, so I know my way around, and I would definitely recommend the location. Shopping, restaurants, and cable cars are very close by, and it is about 4 blocks to BART (subway). The restaurant at the top of the hotel has great views of the city (when it's not foggy), the food is fairly good but pricey. The rooms are average, especially for what you are paying, although SF is notoriously expensive. Was disappointed that internet access was not included (it is $10 per day). Don't rent a car and park at the hotel, parking is $40 a day, and driving around SF, especially if you are not familiar with the city, is not recommended. Take a cab, BART, or cable cars.

Room service was propmt and delicious, however the menu is limited and really should only be treated as a snack menu.The location was excellent right on Union Square - convenient for shopping and transportation connections. The cable cars are right around the corner and are fun to ride to Fishermans Wharf - but scary on the hills. My sister turned 30 while we were in San Francisco and I reserved a table in the restaurant on the 31st floor of the Grand Hyatt to celebrate. The service and the food were top notch, the sommelier and maitre'd were very knowlegeable and made some excellent suggestions. We adjourned to the bar after our very delicious meal and enjoyed the views of the bay and out to Alcatraz. The cocktails were very tasty!I woudnt recommend the hotel for breakfast, an excellent alternative is the Sears diner around the corner which seems to be an institution in San Francisco for both locals and tourists. Really excellent breakfasts are served in Sears.I really loved San Fransisco and I think the Grand Hyatt was the ideal hotel, I would definitely return here if I am ever lucky enough to go to San Francisco again."
"Review_12222","hotel_141","hotel_7545","May 12, 2008","Nice Base for Exploring My wife and I stayed here on a 2-night side trip from Napa. We picked this hotel because of the great deal we received on the internet. Check-in was a breeze, but the $54/day rate for valet parking was a turn-off. Call us cheap, but we said no thanks and parked on the street for free since it was after 6pm. The next morning (Saturday) at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot. This giant lot is catty-corner to the hotel and charges $32 a day. Although the Sutter lot does not allow in/out service, we used the savings to buy two, 24-hour muni bus/rail passes and a muni-map. You can get these at the Union Square half-price ticket window. Driving and parking is such a hassle, I would recommend using the metro. We went to a Giants game, the wharf, and a concert on the bus/street car and Bart and never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a ride. We had a nice room on the 25th floor. The room was 4-star, but the lack of services (e.g. pool, gift shop) make the entire property a 3.5 star. Still, it was a great value and the location can't be beat. Everything is close. We shopped at Macy's and went to Walgreens for our snacks. Both are a block away. The concierge desk in the lobby is excellent!! Based on the comments from another reviewer, we also tried Sears Fine Foods (near Walgreens) for breakfast, and the Starlight Lounge (atop the Drake Hotel) for drinks and dancing. Both places are highly recommended. The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf. Some of these people are too agressive and spoil the whole experience. Denver does a much better job by discouraging tourists form giving to panhandlers and putting donation meters downtown to help fund the shelters and food kitchens."
"Review_12223","hotel_141","hotel_5114","May 7, 2008","Excellent service and location We stayed at the Hyatt in January and it was fantastic. We had two club rooms with great views overlooking the city. Both our rooms had two double beds in them and there was a lot of room. We had 5 suitcases in each room but we still had room to move. The beds are soft and extremely comfortable and the room is well maintained. As part of the club room we had access to the club facilities which included a continental breakfast every morning in the club room, afternoon tea, tea, coffee, water and soft drinks all day, canapes at night (alcoholic drinks you had to pay for) and supper which was usually a cake and biscuits.The people serving in the club room were absolutely brilliant. They could not do enough for you. We were amazed that we were allowed to help ourselves to fruit and soft drink all day and take them back to our room. At night we took back to our rooms cookies and hot drinks and it was great. The hotel is right next to Union Square. You couldn't get a better location if you want to shop. We even walked down to Fisherman's wharf which took about 30 minutes but it was a nice stroll through China town. Macy's is just across the square from the hotel and all the shops you need. Around the corner is a supermarket so a perfect location for a shopping holiday. The hotel doesn't have a spectacular lobby so don't expect to sit in the afternoon in a nice looking lobby. It is nice but not grand.A great stay to end our world trip."
"Review_12224","hotel_141","hotel_9346","May 3, 2008","Very, Very Tired! We have just returned home after 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco, stopping there to get over jet lag after flying back from two months in Asia. We had a Regency Club room which really offered nothing more than a not impressive continental breakfast in the over crowded lounge on the 31st floor. The room was not large, the decor was drab and the furnishings were very, very tired. In fact, we had last stayed at this hotel 32 years ago and I am sure the furnishings, with the exception of the very comfortable bed, are exactly the same as they were then when the hotel was new. This is the only hotel I can ever recall having absolutely NO BATHMAT or RUG of any sort for the bathroom floor and the very low tub/shower combo has no grab bars for safety when using the shower. The Grand Hyatt up the road in Seattle is one of our most favorite hotels in the world and the Grand Hyatt San Francisco could certainly take some lessons from her Seattle cousin!"
"Review_12225","hotel_141","hotel_2912","Apr 26, 2008","Location! Location! This was a girlfiends getaway and the Grand Hyatt was the perfect central location to everything we could want. The hotel is nice and the employees were very helpful. The concierge made nightly recomendations for nice dinning locations where the ambiance was excellent but the food was mediocore at best however ask the staff at the bar upstairs and we got the best information on where to go and what to do. Speaking of the bar upstairs, you have to enjoy the view from the 36th floor even if just for a couple of drinks. The drinks were good and very reasonable so were the desserts (try the carrot cake) however it is all about the view when you are 36 stories up. We truly appreciated housekeeping as we made one call on our first evening in town and advised that we needed extra towels since there were 4 women in one room and they made sure, each night we were there, to leave plenty of extra towls. Also upon check in our bell hop asked what we would be doing and offered to bring us a refrig so that we could store any edibles free of charge. He was the sweetest and it really helped our stay as we stashed our wine bottles after the tour and plenty of bottled water and snacks in the fridge. As for the location right across from a FABULOUS MACY's and other great stores for easy last minute needs but also a few blocks from the Powell Station where all transportaion avenues can be accessed. Three places within blocks of the hotel that you MUST try...House of Nanking at 919 Kearney, the absolute best Chinese ever!! If you arrive after 7pm almost any day you will probably have to wait outside, it is small but INCREDIBLE and definately worth the wait. Sears Fine Foods at 439 Powell is wonderful for breakfast there is also a little spa next door to Sears where we all expierenced great service as we got facials, massage, and pedi/mani, very resonable prices too. Also a block away at the Hotel Drake is a fun bar at the top of the hotel where the view is amazing and the drinks and dancing were a lot of fun. This place was a fun hang out when we didn't want to go far for a little dancing."

The location is excellent - we used BART, streetcars and cable cars to get everywhere and the hotel is convenient for all three.The breakfast buffet on the top floor is good - not cheap - and the view is gorgeous. We had room service dinner twice and the food was excellent (again, not cheap) and the service prompt.Staff were attentive and helpful and I felt well looked after even with the little things - print-your-boarding-pass kiosk in the lobby, morning paper at the door,"
"Review_12227","hotel_141","hotel_7290","Apr 18, 2008","Not so Grand I was somewhat disappointed by this place, worst of all was the noise, and more specifically the creaking in the walls! On my first night I called the front desk to complain about what I can only describe as the sound of creaking timbers in the wall. They told me it was the wind and the building is having some sort of earthquake work going on. Only way they could help was to move to the 3rd floor where it wasn't so creaky but then I'd hear the traffic!The room was nicely decorated in typical Hyatt style, but the TV was fuzzy (and no one could fix it) and the toilet slow to flush (again no one could fix this!). Although when I called about the TV and toilet they where very quick to send someone up. Best thing about this place was the bar on the 36th floor where the view was stunning. The crowd is older, okay geriatric, but it's a great view at Sunset and the drinks are top notch.Overall it was okay, but I wont go out of my way to stay there again."
"Review_12228","hotel_141","hotel_1186","Apr 16, 2008","Perfection in the city by the bay I just got back from the Grand Hyatt and am missing it already. Check in was almost flawless. Ryan at the check in desk is hysterical and made the process more fun than should be allowed. They were having a problem with the key card machine when I got there so they were having the staff personally escort people to their rooms. This was very quickly resolved however and in the time it took me to freshen up a little and walk out of the restroom there was an envelope that had been slid under my door containing the key cards and a letter apologizing.  The room was immaculately clean and the view was absolutely incredible. I stayed on the 19th floor and woke up each morning to a view of the COIT tower and the bay. The cleaning staff did a good job keeping my room clean and stocked and the daily newspaper was laying in front of my door each morning by 7am.  I have seen in a couple of reviews where people have complained about charges for the mini bars in their rooms. I had no trouble at all with that issue because I requested a refridgerator in my room. There is no charge, it was clean and properly working and was there and set up when I got there and already cold. If you request that then you can purchase your own drinks and snacks and keep them in it and then you will not have to worry about charges for the mini bar. I took the BART to the hotel from the airport and it was completely painless. There is a BART station right at the airport and the cost for the trip was a whole $5.35. The BART is perfectly roomy enough for you to take your luggage onto it. It is not like a cramped city bus. The stop for the hotel lets you off about 3 blocks away and it is an easy walk even with luggage in tow.  For those who are shopaholics there is almost every store you can imagine within a few blocks. There is a Starbucks across the street, a Walgreens pharmacy behind the hotel and a number of very good restaurants. The cable car stop for going to the wharf is one block behind the hotel. And the entrance to Chinatown is about 3 blocks away. There is also a mini mart/liquor store a half a block away where you can get things like cokes or drinks to take back to your room.  I was traveling as a single female and never once did I feel unsafe. The area is very friendly and clean and if you need to make a run to get some last minute thing you can do it without worry.  The staff was all wonderful. As I said in the beginning Ryan is hysterical. Lyle is very friendly and helpful. Truly a nice guy. Adam who is one of the doormen/valets is the class clown. Take the time to get to know him if you are a cut up yourself. And my absolute favorite was Joe Vigil who is one of the security officers. San Francisco should be proud to call him one of their own. I actually miss him. David at the concierge desk was also fabulous. Very friendly and helpful and has a warm and honest smile. There is also a gentleman who is from Yugoslavia who is always at the front door. I apologize to him for not remembering his name but he is also very sweet. There was only one person I ran into the entire time that was not up to par with the rest of the staff and that was the blonde woman at the concierge desk. She is not unkind but she reminds you more of dealing with the assistant to the president of a large corporation. More of a state your purpose kind of gal. Everyone else though were all poster children for tourism and public relations for the hotel and the city.  While you are there you also have to check out the view from the lounge on the 36th floor. Go at night. The view is breathtaking and will make you want to stay there forever.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is staying in San Francisco and commend the management for the staff they have put together."

When checking in worth asking for a room on higher floor, The restaurant and bar on the top floor is well worth a visit. We had a drink there in the evening, fantastic views, equally so in the morning for breakfast which was very good value. Expensive valet parking but when you dont know your way around a city there isnt really any other option. Watch where you book these rooms. The hyatt website proclaims to offer the cheapest rate and offers a price promise however when I found a cheaper rate elsewhere which met all of their published criteria they started quoting other criteria that I had to meet which wasnt published on their site. As we were travelling from the UK I had booked with Virgin holidays who were much cheaper than anyone else."
"Review_12231","hotel_141","hotel_2959","Mar 31, 2008","No Bells and Whistles Just spent four nights here on a work trip. My room faced the front of the building so no great view, which was ok since it was work and all, but I was constantly annoyed by the loud, shrill whistles of the hotel staff hailing cabs for people. Awful sound.The room itself was spacious and clean and the hotel staff was courteous and helpful. However, there was one other tidbit that annoyed me during this stay and I find this unbecoming of a nice hotel. There was a coffeemaker in the room but coffee wasn't free. A label on it read complimentary coffee inside the refreshment center. But when you open that door, the coffee is sitting with the candy and water on the sensors and in the door it says coffee is $4. Overall, a pleasant stay that would've been greatly improved by complimentary coffee and the lack of whistles."

It is also a relatively easy walk or quick taxi ride to the Financial District, the Embarcadero, North Beach and Chinatown.The Front Desk personnel were competent and professional. The concierge service was friendly and helpful in answering our questions and attending to our needs. We never once saw housekeeping, but our room was always freshly cleaned whenever we returned after a day out exploring.Our room was on the Gold Passport Floor and was clean and quiet. Furnishings were comfortable and the bathroom adequate.

I picked the hotel because I got a really good rate and it was in Union Square. First the good. If you want to stay in Union Square it's a very good location with public transporation/foot travel within easy distance. The staff were all great and immediately helpful. There is a place at the front desk to print out boarding passes for free. My husband said the work out room was very nice but there's no pool. Now the not so great. The room is cramped. There is not really a good workable space ie no desk. There is a table but it's not positioned well and it's too high for a workspace. Internet is $10 a day and that irritates me. There's a fantastic view from the restaurant but it is very pricey to eat there. We stayed on the third floor and had to wait for elevators. I can only imagine if the hotel had been booked full what the wait would be like for higher floors!There is plenty of shopping within a few blocks and several restaurants. You can also walk to car rental offices within a few blocks. Bottom line we enjoyed our visit but I doubt I would overwhelmingly recommend this property unless you want to be in Union Square specifically."
"Review_12234","hotel_141","hotel_2972","Mar 22, 2008","Seems nicer than it really looks. We checked in to the Hyatt on Thursday the 20th and are leaving on Monday the 24th. When we made the reservation, we asked for a roll-away which they didn't know about when we checked in.We paid an extra sixty dollars to upgrade to a suite which wasn't as great as it seemed. When making the reservation, we requested the bay view room. You can see a small amount of the bay but it is all blocked by the Port of San Francisco building.The mini-bar in the room is way over-priced. $3.50 for a can of soda when you can go across the street and get a twelve pack of soda for less than that. There were a number of broken items in the room when we checked in. The light in the shower stall was and is still dead. The latch on the cabinet in the room for the minibar/dresser was broken. None of the lights in the room are hooked to the light switched. The latch on the sliding glass doors/window are broken. There is a bunch of wire for the phone just hanging out of the wall and the rooms aren't very well lit.I stay at Hyatt's a lot for business and pleasure but I have never seen one in such bad shape.We stopped by the fitness center which is the worst fitness center that I have ever seen. It is about 15' x 30'. Pretty small, plus they don't have a pool or hut tub in the hotelThe pricing for services in the hotel is crazy. Albeit this is San Francisco and a tourist trap, they are still crazy. Below is the pricing for the parking from the hyatt website.*Tax is additional on parking*Indoor valet parking $49.00 per night plus tax with in/out privileges. Vans ok. Oversize Vehicles: High profile cars (SUV) up to 12 feet high, can be valet parked. If the vehicle needs two spaces, guest will be charged for two cars (http://sanfranciscoregency.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/services/parking/index.jsp)I will add some photo's later from the hotel."

After one night of bad sleep, called the front desk and were told that the noise was due to the earthquake retrofitting. The higher floors were particularly problematic. Upon moving to a lower floor, there was an improvement.The room itself was adequately furnished, the bed was comfortable, with soft sheets and lots of pillows. The towels, however, were of a very poor quality, scratchy and thin. The first room did not have a garbage can. The T.V. was ancient with very few channels.

I have stayed at a few SF downtown hotels however this is now definately one of my favourite hotels. l didn't have a reservation at the Grand Hyatt as I actually had not planned to stay at this hotel - l was booked to stay at the Campton Place hotel(part of the Taj hotels and supposedly one of the world's leading hotels) however after spending a night at this hotel, it was so bad that l just had to leave (l wont get into details now, l'll have to write another review for this one!). I walked into the Hyatt and was greeted by smiling  friendly hotel staff. Luckily, they had rooms available and I was quickly checked in to a deluxe room and escorted to my room. The room was reasonably sized - very clean and nicely furnished. My room package also included buffet breakfast which had a good variety of tasty food and great views of dowtown San Francisco(l am told the hotel offers the best views of the city). When l checked out, l asked for a taxi to be organised as l needed to get to the airport. lnstead of hailing down a taxi for me, l was suprisingly escorted to the hotels private luxury sedan and was told l would only be charged the rate of a taxi ride. They didnt even try to sell me the private transfers, they just offered it - a very nice and unexpected gesture!

However, for the normal rate which is about twice as much as we paid - I would have reservations on the grand hyatt SF. The room was fine, basic but nice with a comfortable bed. Overall hotel amenities, were less than desirable. For one, there isn't a gift shop on site which means if you're thirsty, forgot stamps or want a snack - you have to leave the premises to find a drugstore, coffeeshop or the like. I travel quite a bit so the fact that I could not buy basics like bottled water without leaving the hotel was a first. Also, this appears to be a SF thing but the valet service costs a pretty penny. We opted not to rent a car because of this and since public transportation is readily available, we were fine. The location is fantastic - right in the midst of union square. In short - a suitable hotel in the perfect location."
"Review_12249","hotel_141","hotel_9962","Jan 25, 2008","Great Location, Wonderful Staff My husband and I must've looked really excited to be there (without kids) for the weekend because we were given a nice quiet room on the 30th floor - the view wasn't of Union Square but I thought it was nice to be able to see the city lights at night. Upon arrival in our room, a staff member delivered a bottled of champagne with chocolate-dipped strawberries. Not expecting this at all, we asked if he was in the correct room! He said yes, and it was complements of the hotel. Wow. Now, I've read in previous reviews that the hotel is scheduled for renovation. I hope so because the rooms are in dire need of updating. They are decently decorated but the bathrooms need serious attention. I also didn't care for the overpowering deodorizer that they use when cleaning the rooms. I remember the scent from our stay at the Grand Hyatt in San Diego. On the plus side, the beds were comfortable and the bedding adequate. When the renos are done, this hotel will be awesome. Knowing that we weren't spending all of our time in the hotel room, my hotel requirements were a little different - location was my priority. The location of the Grand Hyatt is great. We walked all around Union Square (just around the corner) - and all the way to Chinatown. The only time we used public transportation is when we hopped on the cable car to go down to Fishermans Wharf. The Grand Hyatt's restaurant, Grandview, has been called overrated by some reviewers but I thought it was a perfect spot to unwind after so much walking. We sat in the lounge, ordered a few appetizers and drinks and enjoyed the wonderful view of the city. Coming from a place in Southern California where there are only two tall buildings in our whole city, I was mesmerized. The pianist was entertaining, too.I would consider staying there again, especially after the renovations!"

But the location is great, and I've usually had acceptable rooms. The Gentleman that check us in was in training with a more seasoned staff member looking over his shoulder. The first room assigned on a scale of 1-10 was a 3 at best. The air conditioning outlet had mold on it; as well as the tile in the bathroom. The room was VERY tired looking. I called the front desk and asked for another room. I was told they would upgrade us to a room over looking Union Square. I wasn't so concerned about the view as the room itself and explained that to the Gentleman. Again, he wasn't familiar with the hotel or rooms but we took the room offered. It was a bit larger and with the view mentioned. Fact is this hotel needs a makeover. The furniture, carpets and drapes show much wear and tear. This hotel consistantly has a very high occupancy rate and is probably quite profitable. The competition is very stiff in San Francisco but for whatever reason this Grand Hyatt has not kept up with it. I'm returning to the city in a few days and as much as I would like to stay there again I will not. For me when I travel my hotel is my home and the Grand Hyatt is not living up to the expectations one would have under the Hyatt name!"

"Review_12253","hotel_141","hotel_7977","Jan 3, 2008","Not so ""Grand"" Just returned from a 5-night stay over the holiday week. I don't know how Hyatt decides which properties get the Grand title but this defintely should not be one of them. This hotel is average (at best) in just about every way. Some brief comments: -- The hotel lobby is really small and was constantly crowded. -- Check-in line was so slow we opted for self check-in. -- Room was just OK. Furniture crammed into every nook  cranny. Could hear noise from other rooms periodically. TV in bathroom was a joke as it barely got any reception. Furnishings were a bit beat up. This would be a lousy hotel for business as the room did not have an actual desk to work at. -- Elevators were perhaps the worst I have ever experienced in a hotel (or any building). I would have assumed that 6 elevators for 36 floors would be more than sufficient - not so. When an elevator would finally show up (usually after 5 minutes or more) it was usually already packed. We ended up taking the service stairs more than once. Very, very frustrating! -- Location is great if you are looking to be in the center of the action. Tons of shopping right outside. Chinatown just a few blocks away. Cable Cars  BART closeby as well. -- Concierge let us down as he told us that BART did not go to the Oracle Arena (Warriors game) when it actually does, so we ended up blowing money on a cab.Overall, a pretty poor experience, especially for a Hyatt. I'm guessing Hyatt feels they need to compete with the JW Marriott around the block so they call this a Grand Hyatt. Don't be fooled - this property barely deserves the Hyatt name let alone the Grand."
"Review_12254","hotel_141","hotel_9561","Jan 3, 2008","Loved the Grand Hyatt on 345 Stockton St. We stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Dec. 30 for one night and had a wonderful time! The hotel is conveniently located near Union Square and Chinatown. We got a room overlooking Macy's and Union Square. The room was spacious and the bathroom was large as well. The bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet. The hotel and valet staff was friendly and worked hard to make our stay pleasant. As a bonus, I thoroughly enjoyed the snow villages on display on three sides of the hotel lobby. We highly recommend the Grand Hyatt....can't think of anything negative about our stay there."

But the thing that pushed it over was the fact that we were overcharged for our stay, not once... BUT TWICE!!! Unacceptable if you ask me. Upon check-out we received our bill which charged us for an extra night that we did not stay, we approached the front desk who did take the charge off, but without apology. Now, more than 3 weeks later after staying in this hotel, a new charge appeared on my credit card for an additional $1200!!! How can you make a charge 3 weeks after checkout for $1200? We are extremeley upset by this and every time we call we are told that the accounting staff are all out of town for the holidays. I wish I could take back time and never have stayed here!"

We had a king and it was perfect. The staff was very accommodating overall - Dulce and Jason are the best. Great location - walk to many great spots, and you are two short blocks from transit central. The restaurant (Ozumo) attached is excellent, and two doors down is Perry's, with many more great choices nearby. One sour note: We were there Xmas day, and there were no pastries available that morning except through the rather expensive room service continental breakfast ($15/person). Also, we found out after the fact that there was a list of dining options for that evening at the front desk which the weekend/holiday staff did not want to share - we got a shrug and a, Just go to North Beach and walk around - you'll find something open. Boo. But I will go back!"

"Review_12263","hotel_142","hotel_8633","Dec 17, 2008","Nice hotel, great location I booked this hotel because of the location. It's on the waterfront, a block away from where I used to work, and I miss it. (Left SF 2 years ago). The rooms, while small, are nicely decorated. The bathroom was a decent size, and the shower had great water pressure. As a solo traveler, I didn't mind the small room, but I wasn't a fan of the courtyard view. There was a huge metal furnace-like box right outside the window next to my bed, with pipes running through the courtyard. Definitely the ugliest view I've had (I'm just sayin'.) I didn't expect a bay view since I paid via Hotwire (which the check-in lady made a note of out loud), but since the hotel wasn't that crowded, I thought maybe I'd at least get a street view. Once I was in my room, I didn't feel like pushing it. And really, it was fine. I was concerned that because it was a pet-friendly hotel, there'd be cleanliness problems, but there weren't. Everyone was very nice. The complimentary wine was great, and I liked grabbing a cup of the morning coffee they provide and heading out for a gorgeous walk along the waterfront. I would stay here again if it was just me, but I wouldn't bring my kids since it looks like they only have one-bed rooms."

Every morning there's free coffee and tea (nice touch) there. There's also free wine at 5pm and free milk and cookies starting at 9pm. This is a great thought and really a differentiator for the hotel. There's also free Wi-Fi connections in the rooms and downstairs.The rooms are small however with a call downstairs I was able to get upgraded to a bay view room (great view of the bridge and waterfront) that was bigger. Overall its a nice hotel and great for business travelers. Do not expect over the top luxury but rather a clean, well kept convenient place to stay"

All the people that worked in the hotel were very pleasant. The down side was that aside from the small room, there was limited space to put your clothes, the room was dark and we had an awful view. The upside was that the room was very clean, furniture updated and the staff was very nice. The lobby where they served complimentary wine at 5pm was very large. They also served cookies and milk in the evening. We were able to use the gym for free at the YMCA next door.We ate at the 1930 Shanghai restaurant a few doors down and had excellent food. We also went to the outdoor Flea Market down the street on Saturday. Lot's of crafty items for sale.We would stay there again because the staff was so accommodating and the place was clean and the location was great."
"Review_12269","hotel_142","hotel_1402","Sep 9, 2008","Not for everyone, but worked for me... The location can't be better as it's right across the street from the Ferry Building--great for picking up snacks for the room. There are also several restaurants within a block (even on the same block!) that are very good and do to-go orders.The room was small, like others have said, but we thought it was about normal for San Francisco. We signed up for the Kimpton loyalty program ahead of time and they had a box of homemade trail mix and waters waiting for us in the room.Service was excellent. They serve milk and cookies at night--get there fast before the kids scarf them up! It was insane--I waited for an elderly couple to get their cookies and just as my hand was reaching the cookie plate three kids and a dad ran up and took nearly a DOZEN cookies (yes, the dad!) by reaching over and around me. That's jacked up. But not the fault of the hotel.If I had to do over again, I would definitely pay the extra $50 for the rooms with views. It would have been worth it--gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge.We paid for the parking package and were very glad we did. The staff are totally willing to run out and get your car, as well as give directions and recommendations.We checked out the YMCA facilities and were given a tour by their staff. It smells a bit weird in there but they have great equipment. Also, the staff watch and screen people like hawks--a bit annoying (like playing the Excuse me, but can I help you? guitar riff from Wayne's World), but if I had kids it would make me feel very safe having them go there."
"Review_12270","hotel_142","hotel_6455","Sep 9, 2008","Nice place to stay, small rooms, and get a room with a view. This is a very nice hotel, the only downside is the small rooms. But for business travelers or couples who are out on the town this place works well. They offer some great services. They printed my boarding pass for free, they offer drinks in the lobby, and also have cookies and milk in the lobby at night. And this may sound odd but the soaps in the bathroom were nice. Loved the smell, wanted to take some home with me. The room was also clean, which is a must! The other advice I have is to get a room with a view. My view wasn't great but over it was a nice place to stay."

We loved every aspect of this beautifully restored hotel.The stylish rooms are small but, there is enough storage in the drawers under the bed and in the closet. The bathroom has a long glass shelf. We had plenty of room for our things(don't overpack). Please, spend the extra money and get a king view room. It was so nice to look out of the windows and see the Oakland Bridge -day and night. I would especially like to thank Ross, Dulce(printing my boarding pass so that we got in the A group), Jason and all of the other day and night staff for making our stay so nice. We will come back!The hotel offers free coffee and tea in the morning, apples all day, freshly made iced tea in the afternoon,a wonderful hosted wine happy hour from 5-6pm everyday, and cookies and milk in the evening. We loved coming back to the hotel everyday!The hotel is located on the Embarcadero. The F streetcar is only a block away.You can take this to Fisherman's Wharf and to Union Square/Chinatown. We bought 7 -day MUNI passes for $24 dollars each and rode the streetcars, cable cars and buses everywhere. You can take the California cable car line on Market Street and then transfer to the Hyde and Mason/ Powell lines.This will also take you to Union Square/Chinatown and to Fisherman's Wharf. We even took a Market Street bus to Haight/Asbury. The hotel is in a quiet,upscale area. I liked that it was away from the touristy crowd. There are many restaurants in the area, a farmer's market and really nice arts and crafts venders . We ate at Scoma's at the Wharf, Boulevard and many Italian restaurants in North Beach. I would like to highly recommend the Piazza Pelligrini at 659 Columbus Ave. The food was excellent and the waiters were great."

We were in the city for a wedding at Ghiradelli square so we checked in, showered, relaxed for a couple hours and then we called down for our car. It was available within less than 5 minutes.We did not have the oppertunity to take advantage of the amenities such as the YMCA next door, beer/wine reception, or the free apples but I did enjoy the Chronicle, NY Times, free Wi Fi and a cup of coffee on Sunday morning.The staff was great and very helpful.

Not only did we love San Francisco, but we also really liked the Harbor Court Hotel.The staff was fantastically helpful and friendly, the amenities were quite nice (things like the complimentary cookies and milk at night, apples anytime, lemonade during the day, free wireless internet in the rooms for those with laptops, cotton balls, q-tips, as well as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc. make a difference for me), and the location was really convenient to public transportation, as you are within a few blocks of the Embarcadero Station where you can catch any number of trains or other MUNI transportation, the BART, or the California Cable Cars (go early in the morning on a weekday for no line). You can also catch the F line right to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf within a block (ask the hotel staff how). Also, all of the rails that go down Market Street end at the Embarcadero, so it doesn鈥檛 matter which you take.We loved the post office being right across the street, the access to the Ferry Building and farmer鈥檚 market on Saturday, how close we were to some of the best chocolate in the city (two places in the Ferry Building and Fog City News 鈥?fogcitynews.com), and the comfort of the beds in the room.The hotel lobby and rooms are nicely decorated, although the view from our room of the courtyard was terrible. We saw a bunch of huge pipes鈥f you鈥檙e there for a while spring for the view of the Bay Bridge if you care about that sort of thing. It would have been nice to have two beds, but the hotel doesn鈥檛 have any at all.They let us check in early and held our bags until 4pm on the day of check-out for no charge.P.S. For the best postcards, you must check out Avant Card at Grant and Bush in Union Station. And you should go to the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in China Town. It's a bit hard to find, but you can handwrite your own fortunes and the lady will put them in a fortune cookie right in front of you.Overall, we loved our trip and would definitely stay at the Harbor Court again."
"Review_12276","hotel_142","hotel_3604","Jul 27, 2008","Horrible rooms I found this hotel on travelzoo and for the price of $109 per room/night it seemed great value considering the reviews on tripadvisor. Unfortunately we were disappointed when we got there - the rooms were tiny - and one of them (607) must have been a converted cupboard as it had a tiny strip window 6 ft from the ground - the colours were a depressing brown. There was no air conditioning in either room.The location is in the financial district - good for if you are in town on business or shopping in Union Square - for us though Fisherman's Wharf was a better and more happening place to stay with children.Staff were very nice - they mentioned that I would have to pay a $100 early departure fee as I agreed to it when I checked in (I don't think so!) and were quite happy to waive this when they heard what rooms we were in (602 and 607).So no I would never stay here again - or a Kimpton Hotel for that matter - I find it incredible that there are so many positive reveiws for this hotel on this site.By the way this is my first ever negative review on tripadvisor!"

"Review_12278","hotel_142","hotel_3433","Jul 13, 2008","Fabulous Views, Ok service I stayed at the Harbor Court for business in July 2008. Now let me start by saying that I am not an inexperienced visitor to San Francisco. I think this is important only because the room rates tend to be expensive in this city and you tend to end up with a small amount of square footage for what you pay.My first problem with the hotelm began before I ever checked in. I had reserved a room for one night and my plans changed and I called to extend the stay. My rate was $135 so I called the hotel to check in one day earlier and was quoted a rate of $299. I immediately hoped onto expedia with whom I had originally made the review and they had a rate of $135 for the same room. I told this to the person on the phone and they indicated they would match it IF they could also find this rate. Ten minutes latter they honored the rate of $135. Moral of the story, although the Kimpton Website says they gaurentee the best rate....shop around.Upon arriving at the hotel no one was out front to offer to help with the bags, although this may seem like a nit, in San Francisco when traveling by yourself you need somone to get the bags and take the car so you can check in without getting a ticket.Upon checking in I was told that I would need to get new keys the nnext day as I had two seperate reservations...although not the end of the world, it was not convenient when staying more than one day since I have to expense all of travel back to my company I have twice the number of receipts that I needed.The room was nice (small, but again this is SF) but the view was amazing! If you stay her request the View room which has amazing views of the bay bridge and the Island!Service was luke warm the entire visit, depending on the website you look at they will give from 3.5 - 4 stars....my experience has been that service is better at some of the other Chain Hotel Properties.This hotel is good for business travel if your stay involves business SOMA or the financial district (near the embarcadero) any further than that and this property will be too far our of the way. Holiday visitors would be better to stay closer to Union Square or the warf as this is where you will most likely spend your time.I think this hotel counts too much on the location, and does not have enough substance to make it 4 stars."

An amazing facility with lap pool, bball court, full sauna, etc. I never thought I would be on a treadmill with a view of the bay bridge!-free cocktail reception every night with quality wine and beer-free fresh cookies and milk every night-good coffee and tea available at all times-great customer service-flat screen TVs, ergonomic desk chairs, iPod docking stations-across the street from the ferry terminal farmer's market (thursday/saturday - probably the coolest farmer's market I have ever seen. I highly encourage a visit)Lowlights:-a very, very small room (maybe 12' x 12') that takes a little getting used to. And a $50 flat surcharge for a room with a view of the Bay Bridge.The room we stayed in was well appointed, and we got used to the size, but I would caution any families from staying at the Harbor Court.

Downstairs they provide coffee and tea. At 5:00 they provide free wine and beer. The rooms are small but we weren't in the room very much so it was fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

The Harbor Court fit the bill. In addition, the hotel was running a weekend promotional rate that in terms of SF hotel rates was great ($142.00 for a room with a view!).We arrived early afternoon and the associate that greeted us, Ross was awesome. He worked to have our room ready early and we checked-in around 2:00 p.m. The hotel charges $40.00 + tax per night for valet parking. If you want to save a buck, you can do one of the following:-If arriving on a Saturday night, you can park in front of the hotel for free after 6:00 p.m. and all day Sunday for free.-You can walk 陆 a block to the Howard St. Garage and self-park for $29.00 for a 24-hour period. We chose to park at the Howard St. Garage and it was fine.The Hotel:As a Kimpton Regular, this hotel fits with the brand. We booked a king with a view and I am glad that we did. Others have remarked how small the rooms are and they are right. The king gave us a little extra room and an awesome view of the Bay Bridge. Beware-In order to save space, the hotel has placed its beds on pedestals. That if fine, but the pedestals have sharp corners and if you are not paying attention, ouch!!.The bathrooms are tiny with no counter space. It was challenging for both of us to get ready.The lobby is the largest Kimpton Lobby I have ever seen. The wine-hour was actually enjoyable.As a Kimpton regular, I have now stayed at 4 of their San Francisco properties and rank the Harbor Court as my second favorite. I am still really happy with the Serrano,Bottom line, if you can get an awesome rate, stay here. It is steps from the Ferry Building and it will really rock on July 4th.I am a hotel diva and have no negatives about this place. Enjoy your stay."

My husband and I spent 2 nights at this hotel and we had such an exquisite time, part of it because of our pleasant stay at this hotel. San Francisco is one of our favorite cities and although we've already been twice, there's always something that entices us to go back. The location is perfect! We've stayed in the Marina district before and realized that there wasn't too much of a big city feel in that area so we decided to book in the Financial District where the action is! Plenty of dining choices within walking distance. The Embarcadero is next door! Beautiful view of the bay bridge, especially at night. A quick bus ride to Union Square. We walked from the hotel to Embarcadero to Chinatown to Union Square and back! It's a bit of a walk, but the best way to explore is by foot! There are a handful of clubs within walking distance and it's a quick ride on the muni to the Castro district if you want to experience something unique. The staff was professional and non-intrusive. The rooms are spotless and quiet. Free wine at the lobby from 5-6 nightly and cookies and milk at 9pm. We'll definitely stay here again!"

The staff was wonderful and helped me whenever I had a question about where to eat, how far away something was, and how safe certain areas were.

"Review_12294","hotel_142","hotel_9880","Feb 6, 2008","Great place to stay in San Fran We just spent our second visit at the Harbor Court, and we will certainly be back. Our company has an office in the Embarcadero Center, which requires us to stay in the area. The Harbor Court is just a couple of blocks from there and an easy walk. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms aren't overly spacious, but adequate. The typical Kimpton touches such as complimentary wine in the evening, and fresh cookies at 9pm are nice. New York Times and Wall Street journals are available in the lobby and can be delivered to your door.A big bonus is the gym. The HCH is next to the YMCA and free passes are provided. I had never been to a Y and didn't really know what to expect, but the equipment is excellent! The staff at the Harbor Court always make sure you have a bottle of water to take with you as well.They have a Town Car that will take you to the airport for about $40 (as cheap as a cab). Plus, the overall price is low for SF. I have paid approx 220 - 260/night plus tax.Really lovely place to stay. Will definitely be back."

"Review_12297","hotel_142","hotel_7318","Jan 29, 2008","Everything was fantastic.... My fiance  I stayed at the Harbor Court Hotel for 2 nights. From the moment we walked in the front door to check in, we loved it. The staff were very friendly  helpful, the room was very clean, we liked the location, the coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the morning  the wine/beer happy hour from 5pm-6pm was great!We stayed in a part bay view room on the 8th floor. We had noise from the air conditioner units from the restaurant next door but we walked so much through the day that we slept through it! Next time we stay I will request a room with a full bay view.It rained all weekend  we still walked everywhere. It's not that far a walk from Union Square  it's all flat with no hills. We would recommend this hotel to most people. I wouldn't take kids though."
"Review_12298","hotel_142","hotel_5896","Jan 25, 2008","Location and view makes up for room size A little off the beaten path of the Union Square and FiDi mega hotels, yet it is just two short , safe blocks from a Muni/Bart Station. We had a bay view room w/queen size bed on the 4th floor. Yes, it is a small room but if you are a light traveler it isn't a deal breaker. The bay view room prevented it from being claustraphobic. When we first saw our room I was a little concerned that it might be noisy but the building is well sound proofed and we could not even hear other hotel guests. Many fine restaurants are nearby, as well as the Ferry Bldg. across the street on the bay side and YanK Sing for dim sum on the other side of the hotel. With public transport so close you can travel to a lot of great attractions and restaurants fairly easily. The staff was very professional and personable. Overall, a very nice stay."
"Review_12299","hotel_142","hotel_9440","Jan 2, 2008","Just ok When we first arrived we were able to have a early check in which was great. The atmosphere of the hotel was great as well as the lounge area with its fireplace and flat screen tv. Upon arriving to my room, I went into shock. The room is a staggering 145 square feet!! I have seen bigger motel rooms. Me and my wife kept bumping into each other whenever we both walked around the room. We only came to view the fireworks and thank God that we didnt have to stay any longer than a day. We were able to see the entire show (fireworks)as the barge was directly in front of the hotel! This was the best thing about the hotel.The flat screen tv was off centered from the bed which was ackward and it didnt swivel. The ice holder was so small the only thing you could have put on chill was a 12 ounce soda. The internet was absolutely great as well as the view of the water and bridge. The only drawback here was that the windows were only about 32 inches wide which meant if you really wanted to enjoy the view, you had to stand in front of it. The hotel has no restaurant , but a contract with japanese restaurant next door.Restaurant next door caters to the hotel but don't expect full breakfast. Most places around hotel are closed on the weekends which puts you far from most of the city action. The hotel also doesn't have a gym so if you want to workout , you'll have to go next door to the YMCA which has a contract with the hotel.Upon trying the shower we found out that the water was just luke warm. The clock radio implied that everyone owns a ipod so you couldn't play cd's -I feel anything over $200 should have a cd player. Later in the night we started smelling cigarette smoke. Thats when I noticed that the door had a slight crack that let light and smoke inside my room. Room is so small that theres no room for a coffemaker even if they tried to provide one. So they serve coffee downstairs to make up for it. So, now you will know why this place is so cheap for the location."

The location was perfect for what my husband had planned and the room was great. Our view was of Coit Tower and part of the Bay. The bed was very comfortable!! My husband called in advance to have champange and a fruit/cheese platter waiting for us and it was there. Front desk staff was average at check- in and check-out. The valet parking staff were really nice! The only thing about valet parking (overnight) it cost $47!!! Wow that was a shock. I am use to parking fees at City hotels and was thining about $25-$30 per night but not $47. So much for getting a good deal through Hotwire! Put that aside everything was really nice and we enjoyed our stay."
"Review_12302","hotel_143","hotel_3483","Nov 29, 2008","Average I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights when in San Francisco. As a Hilton Diamond got upgraded to executive floor. Room was spacious and well decorated. Executive lounge was not the usual Hilton Standard and the continental breakfast was sparce compared to many Hilton Executive Lounges in USA. It is very much a business hotel and other hotels eg Westin are much more central and better value for money.Average nothing special."
"Review_12303","hotel_143","hotel_5111","Nov 18, 2008","Nice digs Super nice accommodations. Remodeled less than three years ago, the Hilton's got a luxurious, clean, contemporary feel now. The outside still looks like a Soviet fortress, but who cares? The beds feature beautiful linens, feather beds, down comforters and pillows, and European-style duvets. Everything felt clean and new. Great service all around, from the parking attendant to the concierge. I thought I was in a major jam when I realized I had forgotten to pack a couple basic personal care items and I didn't have time to run to the drug store before catching a ferry. A quick flip through Hilton's guest book revealed their Forgot to Pack service, which offers dozens of toiletries at no cost. Room service delivered my items in five minutes!My major complaint: *tons* of street noise. Even on the 10th floor we could hear conversations from the sidewalk below, the trash collection early in the morning sounded like it was right outside our window, and when a Harley went by it felt like we were inside the tailpipe. Maybe there is something going on with the outside acoustics here...Here's a tip: hotels in the business district aren't busy on the weekends. We went on priceline and bid $99/night for four-star hotels in this area; priceline counter-offered at $120/night and we were in business. Compare to $300/night on hilton's website."

"Review_12306","hotel_143","hotel_5219","Nov 1, 2008","Great hotel This is a great hotel. Any hotel in San Francisco is going to be a little loud. The cars always seem to be honking at something. Yes, I could hear people in the next room. It didn't bother me. I always sleep with ear plugs at any hotel. I stayed on the 25th floor which gave me access to the concierge lounge. Breakfast was great every day. Not alot of variety from day to day, but plenty to choose from; cereal, bagels, muffins, english muffins, lots of fresh fruit, orange juice, cranberry juice, coffee. In the evening they had some vegetables, dip, cheese, bread, crackers, coke, sprite, water,  a hot appetizer. Enough for a light snack dinner. My room was very functional and clean. The beds are VERY comfortable. Even though this is literally right next to China town it is really in a great location. Columbus street is just a block away with plenty of public transportation and GREAT food. A great bonus was that the hotel offered a town car for transportation in the morning - free of charge (of course a tip is generally expected). I would definitely stay here again."
"Review_12307","hotel_143","hotel_2084","Nov 1, 2008","Location and Decor Trump All Stayed here for a conference, and came away with a positive feeling about the hotel. The hotel is located right next to Chinatown, so if you like Chinese food, you'll be in hog heaven here. Be sure to try the Dim Sum for lunch at the Imperial Palace - we had it two days in a row. Also went to the Empress for dinner... about a block away.I took the Super Shuttle to and from the hotel from SFO for $17 plus tip. Never needed a car during my three day stay... plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance.The room (813) was nicely furnished and decorated, with good use of relatively small square footage. A picture window spanned the entire wall, and a desk ran the length of the window. My room had a great view of Coit Tower and occasionally San Francisco Bay off in the distance. This room still had an old style TV, instead of the flat screens which seem to be more and more common. There were a few relatively minor maintenance issues with the room, but nothing I couldn't live with. These included a black-out curtain that was ripped and repaired with a Band-Aid, a phone that didn't work (the other one had assorted single call buttons, none of which were functional), and some struggles with the heater, which seemed locked on an unusually cool 70 degrees. The shower took a little getting used to, since the shower head was only shoulder high (I'm six feet tall).I'd characterize the front desk service as competent, but not overly service oriented. No valet greeted me upon arrival... I got the impression they were really busy with conference attendees (ours and others). Room service for dinner was very good the first night (Pacific salmon), but only so-so the last night (a parsimonious club sandwich). The folks who delivered it, though, were very pleasant and efficient. My room had a single cup Lavazza coffee maker, and each day I was provided with a single supply of caffeinated coffee and one of decaf. One cup just isn't enough for me in the morning... I needed more. Despite the relatively minor problems, the location and decor trumped all. I'd have no problem returning here next time I'm in San Francisco."
"Review_12308","hotel_143","hotel_3791","Oct 30, 2008","Fantastics views in San Francisco Good Hotel. Advertised as a business hotel which I guess means small lobby. My Hilton Honors card must have worked, because I was upgraded to top floor (27) which has a balcony and great view of SF harbor and Coit tower. Room was well done, nice amenity kit, and this floor had free internet (I do not think it is free on other floors). Front desk was very friendly. Housekeeping left thank you note for pillow tip. Close to China Town, and public transportation is easy, but not short walk to much else. Avoid bringing a car into SF because it will be a hassle. Overnight parking in the hotel is $48, and $24 in the public parking structure across the street. If you get a good rate, this is a good hotel I would recommend, even without floor 27."
"Review_12309","hotel_143","hotel_4245","Oct 26, 2008","Not Your Uncle's Hilton The drab architecture of the building itself is the only evidence that this used to be a Holiday Inn. The rooms and common areas have been completely redone and now look more like an upscale boutique hotel.The rooms have been redesigned in a very modern but warm decor. The best part is the long desk that lines the window so that you are easily distracted by a great view. I usually prefer wired internet access as I almost always have signal strength and consistency problems with wireless, but not here. Good strong signal at all times. The Japanese style sliding door to the bathroom was one of the best I've seen as there was almost no space along the sides - a common problem that hampers privacy if sharing the room. A comfortable bed was complimented by a stylish chaise lounge.I did not spend much time in the hotel itself but was impressed with the design of the lobby and the food and retail outlets. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Room service breakfast was pricey but tasty and on time.One of the best things about this hotel is it's location. It is sandwiched by Chinatown and the Financial District, and only one block away from RG Lounge and House of Nanking - two Chinatown favorites. A short walk takes you further into Chinatown or to North Beach.Lastly, all the reviews I read about excessive noise had worried me, but I was not disturbed - by internal or external noise - one iota. I did notice that the ice machine was very loud so had I been in the room next to it I might have thought differently."
"Review_12310","hotel_143","hotel_5849","Oct 25, 2008","OK, nothing more nothing less Visited San Francisco at a busy time of year so booked the Hilton as it was a good deal.I've stayed at the O'Farrell St Hilton before and was really pleased with it. This Hilton is not so good.To begin, it is on a run down street on the edge of Chinatown and the Financial District. The street is pretty grotty with some closed down shops nearby. On a positive it is only a couple of blocks from some of the trams and one block to Chinatown and the business area.The building itself is pretty grim, grey concrete. Reception is OK but obviously not a high end Hilton.We received a welcome note advising that should we choose to check out early a USD100 'admin' charge would be applied. I don't know if this is a new Hilton policy but it's not one I've seen before.Room was OK, small but OK. Bathroom tiny but again OK and clean.Beware the light sleepers, the sound proofing is not great.Overall the hotel was OK, pretty bland but OK.On returning I noticed a USD6.50 charge on my card (interestingly the cost of a bottle of water in your room). I have queried this (I know USD6.50 isn't much but hey it's still money I do not owe them). They have promised to refund the money but it still leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.Would I reccommend this hotel? It depends, as I said it's OK but there are certainly better hotels out there, including the Hilton San Francisco."

"Review_12312","hotel_143","hotel_10565","Oct 16, 2008","Very disappointed.... First time of my life booking through priceline. I requested a king, non-smoking room. Upon arrival, the man who checked us in said in a very arrogant voice, Even though you prepaid for you stay through priceline discounters, I still need a credit card for incidentals. When I asked if we had a nice room, he said, Since you booked through priceline, you will get our run of the house.....When we arrived at our room, we found out that he put us in a double/double room. My husband  I were on a romantic weekend away  we really didn't want to end our first-ever trip to CA in a double/double room. I called downstairs to talk to the same man. He said, We are completely booked. Not one room to spare. And because you booked through priceline, there is no guarantee of a king room. I hung up and called the hotel (not their 800#, but the hotel #) directly from my cell. I asked for the reservations department. The lady told me that they had both regular king rooms and club king rooms available for that night.I hung up my cell  called the manager of the hotel from the room phone.After 3 conversations, she finally agreed to move us to a king room. At first, she wanted me to pay $40 instead of the usual $50 to get a king. I refused. She finally gave in  moved us without charging us an extra fee.Well, the first toom wasn't spectacular.The king room was horrible. It had a small window in the corner. Even with the lights turned on in the room, it was very dark. The TV worked for a bit, then stopped altogether.I will NEVER, EVER stay at a Hilton again after this negative experience."
"Review_12313","hotel_143","hotel_9630","Oct 14, 2008","Great location, comfy beds The hotel is in Chinatown more so than the financial district and just a couple of blocks away from little Italy which is great! The rooms were quite nice, the beds great! The bathroom was unique with a sliding door. If you're sharing with someone you don't know well this could get tricky, there's no lock on the door and it doesn't always close well. Other than the bathroom door, the ony other complaint I have is the elevators. I went as a member of dragon boat team and tons of other teams were there as well. Having only 4 elevators for 20+ floors did prove to be challenging for the number of people coming and going on a regular basis. I walked the stairs a few times to the 9th floor and actually made up there before others who took the elevator.I stayed 4 nights and enjoyed the hotel. We got a good rate since it was a large group. I stayed 4 additional nights in SF at The Donatello which was quite good as well, very different location. The rate for the Hilton was too much for the additional nights."
"Review_12314","hotel_143","hotel_4887","Oct 14, 2008","Mixed - good and bad I stayed at the Hilton Financial District (actually Chinatown) for almost a week while in SF for a conference. Hotel was nice and clean. I'm a Hilton Honors member and had a non-smoking bay view king room reserved. I checked in at 3:30 and was told there were no more bay view rooms available. That's fine, I wasn't going to be in the room very much. The person checking me in put me in a tiny room next to the maid's closet and it wreaked of cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. I went back to the lobby, waited 15 minutes, was told no one had smoked in the room, but finally convinced them I was not going to stay in a smokey room and demanded a non-smoking room. He gave me another room, telling me it was their last non-smoking room, and luckily it turned out to be fine, though being on a low floor looking over the parking structure wasn't exactly what I was expecting. But, it was clean and fairly quiet. Ironically, people checking in after me, going to the same conference, got non-smoking bay view rooms on high floors and they weren't even Hilton Honors members. They did check in w/ a different person so maybe the guy I got was just being a jerk or having a bad day. For the most part, their staff was pretty friendly though the waitress at breakfast acted like bringing us juice and water was inconveniencing her. I'd recommend the small Chinese restaurant next door for breakfast, nothing frilly, but good food for a great price. The food at the Hilton is way over priced, especially for the breakfast buffet w/ it's cold stale waffles and no cooked to order eggs, just scrambled eggs. Overall, it's an ok hotel. I probably would not stay there again though due to the initial room problem I had and because they allow smoking in some of their rooms, better to go w/ a smoke-free hotel if you are a non-smoker like I am."

I can't believe how wrong some of these reviews are. This hotel was the most accommodating hotel I have ever been in. The view from our room was magnificent. Never heard any neighbors and the hotel was packed the full week we were there. The concierge was the best. They were always willing to print something or give recommendations. They also were so friendly and nice and truly interested in you. Yes, we heard city noise, but you are in the city!!!!!!!! This is what it is all about. Everything was in walking distance.

Upon arrival, the neighborhood didn't appear to be very attractive; it's busy, commercial and a bit noisy. But the location proved to be a winner. We strolled into Chinatown for lunch, strolled into North Beach for dinner and strolled a short way to catch the cable car. The rooms are large and nicely appointed. The concierge was fabulous; all of the restaurant recommendations were winners. Beware, however, that this hotel charges an outrageous fee of $54/night for valet parking.

Despite my love for San Francisco, I now try to avoid it at all costs. This has to be one of the noisiest hotels I've ever tried to sleep in. There is no such thing as a good night's rest in any of the rooms. You are surrounded by noise... your neighbors (As the previous posters stated, you can hear EVERY sound! The walls are paper-thin.), the elevators (There are four and they are constantly in motion.), the street noise, the car alarms, the school across the street which has recess continuously throughout the day (Try taking a nap between the bells, basketballs, and jump rope chants!), the police/fire station, and the homeless and drunks that continuously patrol the streets. Oh, and let's not forget the protests that happen across the street almost every time I've been here.Not only that but the management just doesn't care. At least, not when it comes to crew members. I thought their rudeness was only directed at us until I read numerous other postings online. Now, I feel a bit better. Also, as for amenities, it'd be nice to have the option of a refrigerator in my room or the ability to store my cooler in a walk-in refrigerator (Hotels I frequent are more than accomodating.) Once, I inquired about a pool or hot tub and they mentioned the car wash in the basement. I thought, well, that might be fun but, apparently, you're not able to cool off in that, either! lolAll in all, there are many, MANY other options in the neighborhood that are in the same price range that offer a sound night's sleep. I know, we used to stay in them! Look around but do not look here. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEAL MIGHT BE, IT WILL NEVER BE A GOOD ONE! NOT HERE. NOT EVER."

With on-site spa, roof pool, restaurant and friendly consierge, one would think that due to price you'd gotten yourself a great deal, but just wait until you attempt to put your head on the pillow and get some sleep....The windows in this busy downtown hotel have not been upgraded since it was a Holiday Inn in the Sixties, so guests, regardless of how high up they are in the 28 floors are treated to the drunken screams, car alarms and emergency vehicle wails until at least three in the morning.Our personal experience did not end there- we were in a room that had the possibility to be adjoined- we heard every peep, every bowel movement, every pillow wrussle and cell phone discussion about the occupant's brother's STD. UNTIL 5.30 IN THE MORNING.If and when they moved out into the hall it was just as loud, and accompanied by the precussive noise of their door slamming shut due to poor maintenance. When I finally complained, the only solution they offered was to move us to another room- so we can wake up, pack up our stuff, and settle in to a new set of equally noisy neighbors? This was supposed to be a romantic getaway, and so when my fiance refused the new room, the night desk clerk suggested I take up the offer for a new room myself. It's supposed to be a romantic getaway, you idiot!I demanded from the desk clerk that the moment that we checked out, I wanted a word with the manager- not only did they not bring forth the manager, they didn't even bother to ask how our stay was when we did. There wasn't enough time to make a stink about the situation, so I pass this logic on to you, the good readers of tripadvisor.Conrad Hilton, the founder of the Hilton Group, said that above all, the credo of his company was Be Hospitable. This is was the opposite of hospitable. Let 'em have it with both guns and don't give up until you get all your money back. After reading the comments on this site, I'm skipping the management who obviously don't give two figs about their customers, and instead and going straight to corporate. I'll keep you abreast on how well I do getting my money back.just do yourself a favor- by all means, don't stay here. It's a noisy, annoying, sleep-sucking scam."
"Review_12321","hotel_143","hotel_6166","Sep 22, 2008","Nice but you may not sleep much I brough the wife and kids here for one night (a friday) on our way to another destination. The pros: great location (across the street from chinatown, walking distance to union square shopping, you can catch a cable car to fisherman's wharf). The room was nice, clean and modern w/plasma flat screen. As a Hilton Diamond member I was upgraded to a concierge floor with free continental breakfast, which was nice. Staff is friendly and attentive.The cons: the room was a bit small and cramped, the afore-mentioned steam problem from the shower, the bathroom door is a modern japanese-style slider so no real visual or sound privacy (you can peek in on each side of the door (1/4 opening). But the biggest con of all was the lack of sleep due to sound disturbances. The walls must be paper thin as I could hear a businessman yapping in mandarin in the next room starting at 5am, as if he was in the bed with me. This - after being kept up by the sound of a DJ and people partying from some nightclub until 2am (the sound echoed all the way up to the 26th floor due to the close proximity of the buildings). Needless to say we did NOT get a good night's rest. I would recommend this hotel for a couple without kids who plan to stay up late partying (and hopefully you won't be woken up by the sound of mandarin at 5am). :)"

The room was exactly as the photo on the Hilton website, modern, immactlately clean, well decorated, with the most comfiest king size bed, with crisp egyptian cotton sheets. Bathroom was compact but it had everything you need and was topped up daily. Tea/Coffee making facilities, No mini bar, but complimentary bottled water, and an ice bucket for the ice dispenser next to the lifts on each floor. Free internet access and flat screen tv's, Front Desk  Concierge service was very efficient at getting taxi's etc. The hotel Bar was very expensive for drinks.Location was great for North Beach and China Town, lots of great restaurants, try Momma's on Washington Square for breakfast - amazing! its a short walk but well worth it. Try the Stinking Rose for Dinner on Columbus Ave, closest to hotel was Francis Ford Coppola's Restaurant Zoetroupe one block up from the hotel - amazing food and wine, and reasonably priced.Short walk 20 mins to Union Square and all the big stores, on the bus route to the Marina district and easy reach walking to Pier 39, Fishermans Wharf etc. I'd recommend it to anyone.

You can bike all over town via the Embacadero a few blocks to the east. Highly recommend!"

Our only real issue is that they gave us a full sized bed for double occupancy. It was a bit too small for us. Additionally the shower head was way to low, probably better suited for someone 5'4 or under.Although the hotel name reads the financial district, it is located in the heart of China Town."

I think the location is pretty convenient for easy walking access to those areas although it's a bit far from the theater district.Thanks to my Gold VIP status we were upgraded to the 26th floor with lounge access during our recent weekend stay (Thank you, Hilton!). The room was smallish, but pretty nicely upgraded, with flat screen TV, etc. As a previous reviewer already mentioned, the windows are still single pane, so there is definitely traffic and city noise especially during weekend nights. The lounge was nice but small as well, so it got crowded on a Sunday morning.Parking at the hotel is pretty expensive; the Portsmouth parking garage across the street offers overnight parking for a lot less.Hotel staff was overall very friendly and helpful. We did not try the restaurant but the bar area was nice for a late evening drink and snack."

When we arrived, we needed to drop our stuff off and then return our rental car. They wouldn't let us leave the rental car outside for 10 minutes which created some problems. After the car debacle, it was all smooth sailing. The lobby is modern and clean. The check in was friendly and quick. We loved our room, very comfortable beds. The location was pretty good, right on the outskirt of Chinatown a pretty easy walk to the wharf. We walked to everything. On our last night we were too exhausted to go out and had drinks at the hotel bar. It is a very chic bar."

However, the pillows smelled like cigarette smoke. The sheets and bed spread were white. They looked clean. However, on closer inspection I saw black streaks on them as if someone used the sheets for a shoe shine rag. There is a $15 fee to use the gym. The hotel waived the fee for me after I complained about it. I would not give this hotel 4 stars."
"Review_12330","hotel_143","hotel_4235","Jul 29, 2008","Amazing Staff, Great Room I like both an overall review and details when I use this site, so I'll do both here.HILTON STAFF WERE AMAZINGThe staff at this hotel were wonderful. Scott in reservations was incredibly gracious to us when we were in a bind and made magic happen before we even arrived. He saved our trip.The rest of the staff had the same can do attitude, from checking in to constantly being greeting in the elevators and hallways, all the way to the end when we retrieved our bags.ROOMS WERE GREATThe rooms were also nice, well appointed. The bathroom and closet area is a little tight but a small thing considering all the views. Our friends had an AMAZING view of the bay and downtown. We also had so much fun with the views. I love to people watch down on the street; this view afforded that opportunity. The bed was medium in terms of firmness and the pillows a mix of feather and non. All very nice.There was a long desk area by the window and a chair with ottoman by the bathroom wall so, plenty of places to lounge and store things.We are light sleepers but were a little surprised by the road noise, especially bc we were on one of the highest floors. However, turning the AC unit to on, playing music and/or using ear plugs solved the problem.FITNESS = FUNThe amenities were great as well. Being into hotel fitness centers, I was elated at how nice this one was! Treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, etc. Even apples and water in the room, all with a great view in front of you.LOCATION WAS IDEALThe location was perfect for us. Chinatown is right there with plenty of restaurants. We ate at E Tutto Qua which is .2 miles from the hotel and it was lovely. Not a bad walk to Union Square, the BART, etc. Just enough away from all the big touristy areas. We walked the whole time from the hotel, only taking a cab once and the BART to and from SFO. It's a great location.OVERALL - THANK YOU, HILTON!This was a great stay. All six of us in our group had a wonderful time. It was always nice to go back to our rooms each day after playing hard. The Hilton did it right and we tremendously enjoyed it!"
"Review_12331","hotel_143","hotel_6939","Jul 25, 2008","Good hotel, location is a bit inaccurate I had a one night stay here before having to transfer to a hotel in San Jose for logistical reasons. My company travel agent booked it for $209. You can't miss the building. Its a large garish brutalist style tower in Chinatown.Location: The travel agent booked it for me based on the price and the 'financial district' location. The hotel is really in the heart of Chinatown. For that reason, if you aren't terribly cost conscious, I recommend the airport shuttles to get to the hotel. They are about $17. BART is less and will get you to Montgomery Street Station, but its a bit of a hike to the hotel especially if you have luggage. Other than that, its well placed for a visit to the city, tourism or business.Check in: Quick and efficient. I arrived early and the hotel was able to accomodate me. I was able to get the room type requested without any fuss.The room: Good. Large work desk area and...free wireless internet! Nice to see there is one hotel that doesn't nickel and dime you for internet service. Bed was very comfortable. TV is a bit dated. Another note is that if you are taller than six feet, you may find the shower a bit of a problem. I am 5'6'' and its a low shower. Overall though, the room was quite nice and relatively comfortable.Amenities: Since it was only one night, I didn't have a chance to try everything out. I asked the staff if there was a place to get a breakfast sandwich in the AM. Nothing in the hotel. There is a sit down restaurant, but that's it. I had to walk down to Specialty Bakery about two blocks away to grab a quick bite before work.Overall, I liked the hotel, except for the location. If I was planning to be in SF for more than a couple of days, I would definitely want easier access to BART and Muni to get around."

"Review_12333","hotel_143","hotel_8477","Jul 11, 2008","Nice stay We moved to Hilton Financial District after a couple of nights stay at Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf. It was a good decision to move to downtown hotel, it felt like visiting a completely new city! There are two Hiltons in SF downtown, and I chose this one based on the financial district addition to its name which is a bit cheeky since it is in fact in chinatown. the hotel is a few blocks away from Union square shopping central, we did not mind the nice walk to and from the hotel. We got a corner room with lovely Coit tower view, but the room was small and we felt a bit cramped due to a very narrow window which makes the room dark and gloomy. seems the hotel was recently renovated, interiors are nice and the bed is very comfortable. Overall our stay was nice but it didn't make a special impression, it's a good hotel of Hilton standard. just adequate for comfortable stay and we'll still recommend it. although we don't mind returning, we'll probably try another hotel for our next visit."
"Review_12334","hotel_143","hotel_7714","Jul 8, 2008","Great view, great price We booked on the Hilton website for $169/night over the 4th of July holiday, an excellent price for staying walking distance from financial district, Coit Tower, Pier 39 and Chinatown. As Honors Gold members we were upgraded to a 25th floor room with a bay view. This view is positively unbeatable: Telegraph Hill, Coit Tower, Alcatraz and the Bay Bridge make for spectacular photographs. Staff was friendly and attentive. Rooms were recently renovated and very nicely appointed. Only downsides are the windows are not sealed well, so street noise is an issue; hotel restaurant is lack luster, and room service way overpriced. Check out House of Nanking right down the street for excellent Chinese food (Zagat rated), be prepared for a line and poor service, but food makes up for it."

As soon as we arrived we knew instinctively that we had made a good choice.Room was large with a huge bed and luxurious bathroom.As soon as we arrived and were happy with the accommodation we walked down to Fisherman's Wharf (a good 30 minute walk) and spent the rest of the afternoon in the glorious sunshine soaking up the atmosphere. The sea lions were adorable but the smell was pretty unique to say the least!The situation of the hotel right on the edge of Chinatown was superb. Most evenings we walked down into North Beach to Vesuvio's, where on our first evening we had a minor earthquake! We ate at tiny cafe's/restaurants in Chinatown for a few pounds.We walked, and walked and walked. Care should be taken not to stray into unsafe areas as this is pretty easy to do. A good map is a must, and it is advisable to know beforehand where you should go and where you should avoid. Try to avoid the Tenderloin and parts of Market Street, but even with our prior knowledge we still managed to find ourselves surrounded by pretty scary individuals in Market Street.We also booked a day trip that took us around the city, over the Golden Gate Bridge and included a trip to Alcatraz. We also wandered up to Coit Tower and Lombard Street, and spent the best part of a day in Golden Gate Park.I wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again."

"Review_12337","hotel_143","hotel_3147","Jun 23, 2008","Decent hotel - great location, but there are better hotels... We booked at the Hilton based on a bargain rate found on Orbitz. While the name notes that the hotel is in the Financial District, it is better to situate this hotel in Chinatown.It's a short walk to North Beach and Market Street, which makes the location hard to beat.The lobby is gorgeous: very modern, Japanese-influenced style. We stayed in a standard king room with a city view. The room was very small, but modern. We spent little time in the hotel, so we did not mind the cramped space. I would not pay the full rate suggested for this hotel, as there are so many options around San Francisco.Bathrooms have no fan, so beware of your showers setting off smoke alarms from the steam! Avoid room service if possible: we paid $23 for an individual pizza that arrived with a hair on it! We would probably not stay here again, unless we got another amazing rate."

They gave us a room on the 19th floor facing the bay. Words cannot describe how magnificent the view is. The rooms have been redone and are very clean and have those heavenly beds.The only thing I disliked was that you have to pay $47 a night for parking plus tax! You can park across the street for about $26 for 24 hours.Also, the food in the hotel is very expensive. For breakfast, go next door to the Garden Restaurant. Perfect breakfast and reasonable price.

"Review_12345","hotel_143","hotel_4941","May 1, 2008","This used to be that nasty Holiday Inn! I visit San Francisco from time to time, and my company has recently relocated our office in the city to a location near this hotel - and I just completed my first stay there.When I got to the hotel I was very pleased with the visual experience - the hotel is lovely, and the bell staff through the entire stay was a pleasure.It was a strange visit though. As I unpacked in my room I looked out the window and saw a view I know I had seen before. I figured it was just deja-vu, because the only time I had ever been in this area before it was ten years ago, and I had stayed at the Holiday Inn - and that place was SO bad that I checked out the second night. It was bad on a grand scale - like huge hotel awful bad. It wasn't until the next night when I was talking to the bell desk guys that it hit me - I was looking at the same view because I was in the same physical building! If you ever stayed at the awful old Holiday Inn, I highly recommend stopping by the Hilton - the renovation is nothing short of miraculous. I chatted at length with the hotel staff during my stay about it - many of them had worked at the hotel when it was a Holiday Inn, and they all found it amusing that I hadn't realized for a full day that I was in the same place.My only ding against the hotel was that the service was a bit off. When I checked in, the front-desk manager asked me why I had requested foam pillows (I do so because I'm allergic to feathers). She then let me know that I should add that to my profile, because they normally don't honor the request unless it is clearly called out that the person has allergies. She promptly called the room staff to rotate my pillows and make my room feather free - but this was never done. Also, the last evening I was there the staff failed to pick up my breakfast card from the door, and I didn't realize this until I had expected my breakfast. To their credit, they had me breakfast in the room within 6 minutes from me calling down - sans toast - but it was a good effort nonetheless.While the service was a bit uneven, it was a very pleasant stay, and I will definitely be back. The staff was very friendly across the board - among the friendliest I've seen in a Hilton this large. The views are still great, and the rooms are fresh, clean, and comfortable."

On my short trip (three nights) to San Francisco, my husband took me to the hotel that he has stayed in often while on business there. I can see why he likes the place. The Hilton, Financial District is in a convenient part of the city right next to China Town, and a pleasant 20 minute walk down to Fisherman's Wharf. We had a very comfortable room, with normal Hilton amenities and a nice view over to the harbour. Parking was quite expensive, so we used the underground parking building right accross the road, which was about half the price of the Hiltons. I am quite happy to stay there again, and stayed at two more Hiltons during this trip, knowing the standard of accommodation would be good."

The hotel is in a good location - across from Chinatown and walking distant to Union Square and Financial District. If you're able to get the Bay View rooms, it's quite beautiful. The rooms are good if on the smaller side - not bad, not spectacular.Unless you have free breakfast, it really doesn't make sense to eat there for $20. The Executive Lounge is closed for the weekend but you get the free breakfast at their restaurant if you're with Hilton Honors. Parking is definitely ridiculous, but if you're there during the weekend, you can get street parking. Just be careful and read all the signs to avoid tickets.Overall, good overall and very good for the value."

I did call a few days ahead and mentioned we'd be celebrating our wedding anniversary in SF and requested a bay view room possibly on a top floor--- with 2 beds. Since we book the room via Priceline--- my request was noted, but was informed it may not a sure thing at check-in. When we arrived at the hotel after a very long flight from Massachusetts--- we were greeted warmly by Gemma who quickly checked us in, wished us a happy anniversary, and gave us a beautiful room on the 21st floor with a breath taking view of the SF Bay, Coit Tower, and North Beach. The room was small but modern and compact and comfortable. We had breakfast every morning at the Garden Restaurant next store to the HIlton. It's a Chinese Restaurant that serves a very hearty ( omelet, hash browns, toast, coffee) and inexpensive breakfast option---either Chinese or American breakfast choices. The location of this Hilton made it the perfect location to walk everywhere: North Beach, Embacadero/Ferry Building, or Union Square. We also bought a 3 day MUNI pass that allowed us to take busses or cable cars to explore Golden Gate Park ,the Presidio and Crissy Fields. It was a perfect vacation made even more memorable by our stay at the Hilton."
"Review_12350","hotel_143","hotel_8974","Apr 13, 2008","One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in From the start this hotel was terrible. Check-in was overly protracted and carried out by a man with an attitude who didn't like the fact that I had made multiple bookings over my stay. I was told that I would have to check out and back in again at the end of each booking (service hey!). This guy who has no understanding of customer service ignored my questions and proceeded to answer the 'phone when dealing with me (sure, I don't mind waiting after my 13 hour flight). It got worse when he told me the room was not ready - it was 9.30pm (not am!)! The room was more representative of a 1 star hotel...it was inconceivable that the windows were not double glazed and it was possible to hear all sorts of noises outside from traffic, to screaming children, bottles being emptied from the bar and trash vehicles loading up (all night). Desk staff told me there was no chance of a room change. However, when I spoke to the only human being at the hotel - Kristina from Norway, she said I could change room the next day. I didn't sleep that first night but of course, they don't offer a refund. The second room was better, but still had some issues. There was a beautiful view of the San Francisco bay, but still no double glazing of course, so noise was still quite loud...no as bad as the previous room though and with earplugs (which were trashed by the housekeeping staff the next day!) I managed to get some sleep. I had paid for a room on the club floor. Don't bother! The only material difference is a flat screen TV. Inclusive access to the conceirge lounge means nothing. The lounge is simply a single guest room transformed into something worse than the cheapest Best Western, it was crammed and full of children. As a business traveller I expected better, but ended up eating the horrid breakfast (no choice - just a few croissants) on my lap. I asked the next day if I could have breakfast elsewhere and was given vouchers to do so in the main restaurant. The service was the same as in the remainder of the hotel...took 12 minutes to get a coffee and you must flag staff down to get it...they are so engrossed in their gossip chats that they obviously forget the customer. Many guests noticed this and although it did not take 12 minutes to flag down the staff for coffee everyday, they did require flagging every day!On the weekend, the club floor lounge does not open at all. It seems that the club floor rooms go to just anybody too. I wanted the club room as I have to work. Impossible, it was so noisy with group meetings/music next door and kids running around all afternoon upstairs. Despite 2 calls to the front desk nothing happened and I barely got my work done...A couple of other points to note: no minibar; very very limited room service both in terms of choice and hours of operation; they will not allow you to borrow electricity convertors...you have to purchase for $25 - I have never ever experienced this in any hotel I have stayed in during my years of worldwide travel.My advice is do not stay in this hotel under any circumstance you will only be disappointed....if you do, don't bother to pay the extra for a club room...it's just a label that means very little....chances are if you book a regular room you'll get upgraded to club anyhow, especially at the weekend!I leave tomorrow and can't wait to get out of here. For Hilton I would say it's the worst hotel I have ever stayed in...it offers nothing and gives poor service and memories."

Since we were so early, we said we would just wander through Chinatown which is just blocks away and come back after lunch. The concierge is fantastic and friendly. He was helping people check out, giving families with kids great ideas of things to do, and recommending places for lunch. He was right there by the registration desk. No problem with him being unapproachable. I even asked him for a lunch idea. (It was great and had been a Rachael Ray recommended restaurant)After lunch, we returned to the hotel to see if a room was ready. They still didn't and when I mentioned that we had been there since 10, the front desk person said that she would upgrade us since we had been waiting a few hours. Upgrade she did, to the 27th floor. I opened the door and my jaw dropped. Straight in front of us was an unobstructed view of Coit Tower, Alcatraz, Angel Island, North Beach, etc. In all my years in SF, this was one of the best views I have ever seen. You do not have to be that high to get this view either, but if you can afford the upgrade, it is worth it. This hotel is completely remodeled and it is very well done.On the following day, while waiting for a car to take us back to the airport, security tightened, and we were not sure what was going on. Just then, an entourage of people in dark suits started to pass by us. Senator McCann was checking in. He walked by me and we shook hands and I wished him luck in his campaign. I bet he liked his view from his room."

The room and bathroom was large enough for two people and the views were amazing from the 26th floor!

We paid about an average of USD350 per night. I was there with a family of 7 and we booked three rooms. One room had no safe at all. When we requested for a change, the receptionist asked us to change within ourselves - as if the rest of us do not require a safe in the room. One room did not even have a chair and when ordered room service, we had to eat on the bed. Another room's amenities were not equipped fully. The customer hotline was not working, and nobody answered the phone when we called the reception. When we told the receptionist that there was no one answering the customer hotline button, they did not even know the button exists! On our last day checking out, we called for the bell service to get out luggages down. We waited 15 minutes and decided to go down to the reception only to find out that the concierge was not informed that we needed out luggages brought down. We booked a cab from the hotel to get to the airport. When we waited and there was no cab in sight, we checked with the receptionist and they answered, Just pass them the voucher. It's not our problem. To which we replied, You didn't even tell us what the cab would look like or the number plate. How should we know which one is it?

Valet parking is $47 a day, which is bordering on absurd. I parked the car myself in the same lot the second day for $25. They did charge me for 2 days of valet parking, but corrected the bill without any question. I didn't fond the rooms to be so small. Every room seems to have a great view. I had a great deal of $79 with Priceline, and that's unbeatable for SF."

The only thing I didn't like was that I didn't get the non smoking room requested. Try the fruit on the restaurant, the best and more delocious fruit I've ever tasted!"
"Review_12358","hotel_143","hotel_7510","Mar 7, 2008","Clean, comfortable, great view We stayed in a deluxe king bay view on the 22nd floor. The room was on the smallish side, but was very cozy, comfortable and clean. The bed was crisp and inviting. Our view was spectacular: coit tower in front with the bay on either side. The bathroom was small and uninspiring, but adequate for a short stay. The shower had good water pressure and was a welcomed respite after a day or evening out in the city. Other posters had mentioned an issue with noise, even on the higher floors. We did hear a quiet hum of city noise in our room, although it was not bothersome in the least. The only annoyances were the occasional sirens and horns blaring in the streets below. For some reason, that type of sound traveled up very clearly and at times, like during the middle of the night, sounded as if they were right outside of our room. The lobby, except for the immediate entrance which had a couple of bright and airy seating areas, was modern but cold and uninviting. The front desk staff were fine, but not overly friendly. The concierge desk was friendly and well meaning but not highly knowledgable. Our most positive encounter with staff, however, was with a housekeeper that we passed in the hall next to our room as we were getting ready to check out. She greeted us so warmly that it left us with a very positive feeling. Overall we would certainly consider staying here again."

Great location too...within walking distance of Union Sq. and the Embarcadero/Ferry Bldg. The hotel is practically in Chinatown, so you're near that and pretty close to North Beach (Little Italy) too. Only negative point might be the expensive parking. I ended up using a different lot that was cheaper and literally only a block away from the hotel. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also try and find overnight street parking, which is what I also did since I was only there for the weekend. Just be warned...read the signs CAREFULLY!!!!"

Good, central location for shopping etc. Our room was about 10 minutes walk away from the lobby, which seemed a bit excessive, and very small. The bathroom was so small a toothbrush would barely sit on the tiny shelf! Small bed too (4 ft). I wouldn't recommend this for a couple at all, find somewhere with a bigger room and a less businessy vibe."
"Review_12362","hotel_143","hotel_7315","Feb 11, 2008","Small room, big fun I felt like this hotel was inexpensive for a purportedly 4 * hotel in SF. We had a rate of $149 on a weekend. The room was totally adequate and I requested a view of Coit Tower and got it free of charge, even though they said they usually charge extra for that view. The room was small, very small compared to other hotels I've stayed at in SF, but the view was amazing. The Tv was old and outdated and not in any sort of armoire. It was sitting on a stand in the corner. The bathroom door was a slider that was on the outside of the room (not a pocket door) with a big gap, allowing virtually NO privacy. Something to be noted depending on who you're traveling with. Despite all that we had a great time. Chinatown and North Beach are within walking distance as is the Embarcadero. The lobby is nice with a great lounge and a decent restaurant. Across the street is a great park for kids with replica Chinatown buildings. It was a fine stay, but NOT fancy at all. Also, $50 parking!! Figure this in when deciding on a hotel. And I really don't think it merits 4*'s: inadequate bathroom door, no robes, no turn down, very small rooms, etc."

Nice furnishings, quiet, and comfortable. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel which was fast enough.The beds are amazingly comfortable!Location is fine- ignore the financial district tag as its really not a big issue. If you want to go to union sq sort of area its a couple of bucks ride away- no more than a few minutes cab or a few mins drive.Its nice and central for most things in SF, but quiet enough at nite that you will get a decent nites sleep.Staff great, doorman helpful, and the hotel is as you would expect from a hilton.Dont park in the hotel lot (its $45!)- use the one across the st, or go 1 block up onto jackson st (turn right) and there is a good underground secured lot there which won't break the bank.Great irish bar (kels- see my seattle review for mention of their sister bar!) a block away on jackson, as well as a great burger place (whose name annoyingly escapes me..). Plenty of nightlife and restaurants not far away just a few blocks north of the hotel.Myself being a Hilton Hhonors gold card holder has its advantages... access to the exec lounge with complimentary continental breakfast saves a fair amount of cash over a stay- especially if you have more than one guest. Dont count on this unless you pay for an exec level room or have Hhonors status though!Will stay again without hesitation."

"Review_12365","hotel_143","hotel_8789","Jan 22, 2008","Expectations Met for SFO Spent weekend at hotel in very comfortable room - although hotel face-lift did not include replacing drafty windows which means the street noise can be heard. Downtown San Francisco is noisy at the best of times so the hotel really needs to invest in improving this feature to really shine. Room service was good and fast, although like everything else in the City, somewhat overpriced. The most disappointing aspect is the dingy room used as a Business Lounge - this is typical of many Hilton's in the US where this feature is not really taken seriously as compared to overseas Hilton properties. The hotel service was quite good though with front desk and concierge most pleasant. Overall good experience, but hotel is 7 dressed up as a 9."
"Review_12366","hotel_143","hotel_10567","Jan 16, 2008","Very Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel in the spring of 2007 for nine nights while on business. The pictures and description from Trip Advisor were very accurate and the rooms were very nice. Overall the rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. I was given a bayview room which was great except for the fact that it was the room farthest from the elevators which meant that my window wasn't as large as the window in most of the other rooms - the view was a little obscured. I didn't eat in the hotel restaurant or patronize the bar, but both looked very stylish. The parking charges were expensive, but from what I gather that is the way things go in downtown SFO. The hotel staff members were very helpful and the valets always had a smile. The hotel was a short walk to Union Square with all the shopping a person could ever need. With this hotel you are also very close to the BART system, on the edge of Chinatown, and a quick cable car ride to Fisherman's Wharf. I would definitely recommend this hotel for business travellers and tourists who want good value for their hotel dollars. This was my first trip to San Francisco and I really enjoyed it."

"Review_12368","hotel_143","hotel_8630","Jan 13, 2008","Cleaned Up it's Act! We had to spend one night in San Francisco before heading north and I wasn't going to spend an arm and a leg on a pricey hotel room. I found a good rate at the Hilton in Chinatown and booked it. I knew this hotel, it was the former Holiday Inn Chinatown. This hotel had a lot of wear and tear when it was the Holiday Inn and I wasn't expecting anything. We just needed a room at a good price. My expectations were low.I was surprised at every step of the way. Hilton has spent a ton of money to upgrade this hotel and it showed. The hotel's architecture is 60's concrete and little can be done with the bland exterior. However the lobby has been redone and is urban chic. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. It was late when we checked in and they gave us a tip of calling a great pizza place in North Beach and ordering a killer pizza, the pizza place delivers to the hotel. It was a tip that we took and did not regret - it was great!Our room was comfortable. We had a wonderful city view. The decor was modern and updated. The room was average sized, but had big comfortable beds and nice new furniture.I was only sad that we had to leave so early in the morning. I wasn't expecting much, but was nicely surprised at how nicely Hilton has redone this dump of a hotel. The staff also gets kudos here!"

"Review_12370","hotel_143","hotel_5078","Jan 11, 2008","Great Destination I put a bid on Priceline for a 3 star hotel for 90.00 per nite. I didn't know where we were going to stay, but was happy to find our bid accepted by the Hilton Financial District. After reading many reviews, I wasn't sure of what to expect, but I am usually a little skeptical of really negative reviews.We were NOT disappointed! This hotel is a GREAT deal for that price! Was it perfect? No. But it IS a VERY nice place to stay! I would LOVE to stay there again for that price! The downside: The room is comfortable, but not overly roomy. It is however, well appointed with nice furniture, and a very nice bathroom, even if it isn't overly roomy. The bed was VERY comfortable, and we had NO problem getting a good nite's sleep. We were on the 6th floor, and there was no noise to speak of, and we were there on a Friday and Saturday nite. There is not a lot of room to store luggage. Parking is expensive. 50.00 a night for valet parking. You can park right across the street for 37.00 a nite, or you can go up Kearny one short block to Jackson, turn right, and and there is a nice parking garage there for only 24.00 per nite. You can drop your luggage off at the hotel entrance and then take your car to the garage on Jackson. Don't let the valet take it, or you may be charged!Other than that, we had no problems staying at this nice hotel. It is right across the street from Chinatown. 2 of the highest rated Chinese restaurants in San Francisco are barely a block away. The R  G Lounge on Kearny, and the Hunan Home's Restaurant on Jackson. We ate at the Hunan Home's, and it was some of the BEST Chinese food we have ever had! The Honey Walnut Prawns are delicious!Another Highly rated Steakhouse is literally 50 feet from the entrance to the hotel. It's located on the side street (alley) to the right of the hotel entrance as you face it. It is called Alfred's Steakhouse, and has been in San Franciso since 1928. It is a classy place with mouthwatering steaks. The Porterhouse is 32 ounces! My wife and I split that with a couple side dishes, salad, and ended up each taking some steak home with us. This is NOT sizzler. But it IS worth the money! Reservations recommended. All in all, we were VERY happy to have stayed at the Hilton Financial District San Francisco, and would LOVE to stay there again!"

"Review_12372","hotel_143","hotel_4840","Jan 6, 2008","Great Location, Great View My wife and I had an enjoyable 3 nights between Christmas and New Years. Our 14th floor view of Telegraph Hill and the Bay was wonderful. There were times we couldn't see the Coit Tower for the fog, but it was allways magical. We had a meal and a breakfast in the restaurant and both were excellent. We had the same waiter both times, and he was very friendly but didnt intrude. I think some of the negative reviews that have been posted have been from priceline-type guests who may not get rooms very high up or bayside. The single-pane windows do let in a bit of street noise, but complete silence wouldn't be right either. SF is a city!Another nice feature is a pedestrian bridge directly from the hotel to a major park in Chinatown. The hotel is at the very western edge of the financial district and is the nearest big hotel to Chinatown, with its narrow, crowded sidewalks and perhaps the best people-watching in the city.One other thing, we have Hiltion Honors membership, and that may account for our good room location."

Union sq shopping wasnt my thing but it took 10-15 mins walk. The hotel is next to friscos landmark building the Transamerica pyramid which you cant appreciate until you view it from a distance. Chinatown in next door up a hill, broadway and the many adult clubs are like 2 minutes walk away ;)The hotel itself was clean as hilton standards expect, staff were always helpful giving directions etc. I got a 'bay view' room which was awesome, if i hadnt then i would have been faicing a building and oit would have been bland so request bay view. Room was spacious, had the usual amenities, bathroom was very nice and modern, shower great.Ididnt eat in the hotel but had a few late beers and the bar staff were nice and liked to flirt, expecially the women! Its a bit of a trek to fishermans wharf but an enjoyable walk. took 20 minutes to walk to pier 33 for the alcatraz ferry. use taxis if you must but you wont get the frisco experiance. I would stay here again definately as its far away from the castro area if you get my drift!"

San Francisco is a lovely city with lots to do and see. This hotel is well situated for Fishermans Wharf, a couple of blocks away from all the attractions, Alcatraz ferry, cable cars etc, but on a fairly quiet road. Staff were brilliant and friendly. We got a Kingsize bed in a good size room with a nice shower! Shops are handy, and hotel had laundry facilities if needed. Another review recommended the Hollywood Cafe opposite and I would do the same - we ate breakfast there every morning and cannot fault the food or the service - although we didn't try the hotel restaurant (Knuckles) we heard/saw some poor reviews and the Hollywood served up great food.Cable cars are very close - the Hyde line goes from outside the Argonaut Hotel and gets very crowded.....go to the Mason line at the back of the Hyatt and there are no / little queues that we experienced.Only let down was the shuttle service recommended by Expedia (Supershuttle) - where the driver could not speak english and took two hours to find our hotel after nearly killing us on more than one occasion......other than that I would highly recommend SF and the Hyatt at Fishermans Wharf.Mark Young (London)"

"Review_12384","hotel_144","hotel_6600","Oct 27, 2008","Good hotel, but it's in Fisherman's Wharf Unlike most of the hotels on North Point, the Hyatt retains some character from the original buildilngs. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, although I noticed one party leaving the walk-in restaurant after about five minutes and not being served. I was eating in there at the time and my experience was fine. Our room was a little larger than average and the outside wall was completely windowed (looking on to the pool area). The furnishings were modern and mostly shades of dark brown. Despite having a large flat screen TV, the picture quality was terrible. The hotel seems to have been recently refurbished, but the bathroom and light fixings looked as if they'd seen better days. The shower looked modern, with the water coming from a nozzle in the ceiling, but wasn't that fantastic in practice. The bed was huge, but the mattress could probably do with being replaced. On the plus side the room was quiet, clean and well furnished, the coffee machine was a boon and being by the pool area was very convenient. I guess it's par for the course to charge for everything in the room in that sort of area, including internet and bottled water, but there are guest laundry facilities (if you're so inclined). This was my first time to SF, and on reflection would not recommend Fisherman's Wharf to friends thinking of staying in the city - it's tacky, very touristy and disappointing. I intend to go back to the city and stay at the Embarcadero Hyatt on Market - a more interesting part of town and far easier to reach from SFO on the BART."
"Review_12385","hotel_144","hotel_10166","Oct 24, 2008","Excellent but not 100% service We stayed here in April 2008 Myself, Mum, Grandma and we all loved it. The location is a great place for exploring around the Wharf area and it's easy enough to get to the city centre. The room was tastefully decorated as was the bathroom and the tea, coffee, toiletries etc was all great quailty. It felt luxurious, something from a magazine and the staff were all lovely. So the problem? Someone had obviously wet the bed and it reaked where it had warmed up!! I felt disgusted that I'd slept in it (without realising untill I woke up) , even my PJs smelled; sooo gross. We spoke to head of housekeeping who apologised and said she'd adjust our bill. I know that this isn't the hotels fault but I don't understand how it wasn't noticed when preparing the room or if they did notice and hoped we wouldn't. Also the bill adjustment was half off the room price, considering that room was now unrentable, I had to get my stuff washed etc and we spent so much on parking and internet access with the hotel (not real luxuries IMO) that it didn't affect the overall bill that much I鈥檇 have liked better compensation. Just for how disgusting and inconvenient it was. Perhaps because we didn't push the complaint hard, we tried to be understanding but express that it wasn't good enough.I know this won't happen to many people but I deducted 1/5 for the fact that I wasn鈥檛 100% happy that it was allowed to happen in the first place and that the compensation for it could have been better.Overall it's a freat location and hotel and I don't think they are used to any complaints!

They appreciate and understand the value of tourism dollars. Didn't eat at the restaurant - too many choices close by and didn't want something ordinary.

I looked at hotels in various locations in San Francisco. Fisherman's Wharf gets slammed as being a place that locals avoid. However, we were very glad that we chose Fisherman's Wharf as our base since it is so convenient to all types of transportation, is quiet at night and is less congested than other parts of San Francisco. The hotel is very clean and contemporary. Every Hyatt staff member that we encountered was pleasant and, if needed, helpful. The maid service was first-rate. I really liked the updated, contemporary furnishings in the rooms --- very clean with a large bathroom. We fell in love with their beds. The pillows and mattress are a piece of heaven after a long day. and the best of any hotel that I've stayed in, including The Ritz Carlton. Overall, we were not impressed with Knuckles, the Hyatt's sports bar  restaurant. We ate there three times - twice for dinner and once for breakfast. The french fries were really great, but everything else was just okay or terrible. I'm a huge fan of Corn  Crab Chowder, but I was underwhelmed with their take on the dish. The breakfast buffet doesn't have a large selection and is very overpriced. You're better off going to one of the cafes across the street."

"Review_12395","hotel_144","hotel_4028","Sep 9, 2008","Great for what we wanted I was there with two sons, 14 and 6. Our 2 essential criteria for our SF hotel were a pool and a great location. The Hyatt has both. After 3 days in SF, I asked my 6 yr old what he liked best about SF. His immediate response, the hot tub. Having a pool is really a huge plus for my kids, otherwise I would have booked a nice BB. Our other 'must' was excellent location for sightseeing, not shopping. Hyatt hits a home run there, too. Right near Fisherman's Wharf and lots of public transportation. The location was superb.The hotel was very nice in all regards, although there was not a free breakfast. Usually we ate at the Hollywood Cafe across the street - not cheap but large portions so you could share, and the food was excellent and fresh. The Hyatt concierge was pretty helpful. We could have booked excursions through the hotel before we got there, but I think it was better that we did it separately (also, before we arrived - that was very helpful). I don't think the hotel's recommendations were that great. Use TripAdvisor to find the best things to do and the best tour operators.We ate in the hotel's restaurant, Knuckles, one night. Nothing to write home about. There's a new Thai restaurant (something Moon? Pearl?) just a block closer to Fisherman's Wharf, decor was like a cafeteria but the food was very good and relatively a bargain. SF ain't cheap! Two nights we ate at an Italian restaurant two blocks to the right as you exit the hotel, on the same side of the street. It was quite good, not cheap but won't kill you.The Holiday Inn Express across the street looked a bit cheesy compared to the Hyatt, but it's actually rated a bit higher, sounds like it has free breakfast and I think it has a pool, too. If you don't care about staying in a fancy-looking hotel, I'd book whichever one gives you the better rate. All in all, a generic but professional hotel with key attributes of location and a pool - definitely a pleasant stay."

The a/c was an older system and a bit loud coming on/off. Bathroom could use towel rails and fan and the new sinks really didn't have the best drainage. Loved the citrus-lavender toiletries. Also appreciated the single cup Starbucks coffee in-room. We didn't use the internet service. Reception people and porters were extremely pleasant and accommodating - always welcoming back from our day and asking if they could help us plan our morning. We consulted the concierge one evening and found this man a tad short and unaccommodating - not at all representative of the majority of staff. We ate at Knuckles one evening; average sports bar - nothing to write home about. The hotel was a great location for our wknd. It was far enough away from the main tourist route and smell of the wharf area. There is a great cafe across the street Hollywood Cafe for bkfst. Super Sightseeing is also on the corner - excellent. On the other side of the hotel, Cost Plus World Market, where one can buy cheap wine, cheese and take back to your room. We would stay here again for easy location, nice staff and wonderful beds!"

This hotel has nice big rooms,large bathrooms and modern amenities.The front desk staff were very nice upon checkin and allowed us our room at 11:00am after checking out of the Tuscan Inn.The cleaning staff did a great job and were always friendly. Knuckle's sports Bar has a nice atmosphere but the food is overpriced with small portions.The Hotel is two blocks from the waterfront,the cable cars are one block behind and the #10 bus to ATT ballpark is one block down right beside the Tuscan Inn.The Hyatt is the next block down from the Best Western Tuscan Inn with the Hilton and Marriot just down the street and the Holiday Inn Express right across the street,so lots of hotel options in the area. The Hyatt room rates are a little more than some of the other hotels mentioned but I think it was worth the price as this was a very clean comfortable hotel."

(we're from southern california). we thought our room had a lot of street noise - after all, you're in the city. we turned on the fan on the air conditioner. the noise from that enabled us to sleep soundly. comfortable bed. we did the duck tour which was fun. make sure you get to pier 39. go to the end of it to see the hundreds of sea lions - absolutely adorable and it's completely free. had a great time and will return as usual."
"Review_12402","hotel_144","hotel_3183","Aug 5, 2008","Loved San Fran. Booked room nine months before stay with an agent. Requested a two queen bed room and a rollaway bed for two parents and two teenage daughters. At check in, was given a king bed room, for four people!!!, because our agent didn't specify two queen beds, although the booking specified four people!! They said they were fully booked and this was the only room available.Apparently though, this worked to our advantage because the hotel has a two bed to a room policy. This meant that if we had a two queen bed room, we could not have had a rollaway bed, but a king bed room comes with a sleeper/ couch which isn't classified as a bed so we got a rollaway bed as well. We stayed in seven hotels in total during our vacation in California but this was by far the most comfortable.BUT..... the room we were given was a disabled room which meant that we didn't have a bath tub, but a walk-in shower room. The problem was that the shower head was set at a height of about 5' 5'' and my husband is 5' 11'' . Also the shower has an area of about 2' x 4' of a tiled floor sloping towards the drain separated from the rest of the bathroom by a curtain. The rest of the room slopes away fom the shower area, therefore any water which escapes the shower area floods the bathroom!!!!!! This happened every time we used the shower no matter how careful we were.The room had a view of part of the hotel roof and other rooms, but we weren't in there much so not a big deal.We can highly recommend the Hollywood Cafe opposite the Hotel entrance for breakfast."
"Review_12403","hotel_144","hotel_1153","Aug 4, 2008","Perfect location for a tourist I just returned from a week long stay at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf. First and foremost, it's a great location, but a bit on the steep side for the amenities. I chose not to spend the $10 a day usage for the internet. On the upside, it's literally two block sfrom the Wharf and a short walk from Ghiradelli Square to Pier 39, the main shopping/tourist spots. The cable car stop is behind the hotel. I was traveling with my elderly mother and my two sons and sharing a room was not an issue in terms of space. The rooms were comfortable, bedding was fluffy, but if you're looking for a firm bed, that's not what you will get. Surprisingly, there is no mini bar (or fridge) in the room, and there is no fan in the bathroom either The rate we got via AAA was better than the internet rates, plus AAA rate got us free buffet full breakfast each morning (eggs, fresh fruit, bacon/sausage, banana bread, etc), which is a huge savings. We chose the hotel for their outdoor hotel, but who knew that SF weather in late July would be so cool (it's like Maine weather so a bit cool for the pool when we stayed here). Downside is they only have one concierge on duty at a time, so the wait to get any information about tours or maps can take forever, and if the younger of the two is on duty, i wouldn't even bother asking him restaurant recommendations or suggested tours or routes. He wasn't very helpful and didn't seem to enjoy his role as concierge. The older gentleman was wonderful and extremely helpful and informative. The Radisson and Holiday Inn were close by as well, and are less expensive, if you don't want to spend the $270 a night at the Hyatt.TIP: Best place for dim sum is New Asia on Pacific Street in Chinatown, it's authentic and delicious. All the local Chinese eat there..(Yang Sink is the one the concierge and everyone seemed to recommend, but it's in a corporate office building, and it's really tailored to non-chinese tourists, and although a nicer setter and delcious food, is very expensive for dim sum). We had the same dishes at New Asia for less than half the price of Yang Sink...and it was better!"
"Review_12404","hotel_144","hotel_3836","Aug 4, 2008","Average hotel We stayed at the Hyatt Fisherman's Warf during our San Francisco sightseeing trip. The location of the hotel was perfect, just around the corner of the warf. The hotel had an outstanding service when we arrived with our car and the check-in went more than smoothly. We needed some help with the booking for our Alcatraz tickets and we asked the concierge for some help. He took immediately care of it. Don't use the concierge service for dinner suggestions because they have really no idea! The rooms have a nice bathroom and they are clean! The size was perfect. We also visit there StayFit Fitness Center. It was a poor room without any daylight and a low ceiling. Breakfast buffet was simple but with a good quality. On our 3rd day 2 busses with teenagers arrived in the hotel. We couldn't believe that this was possible in such a hotel. On our last night they started (it was past midnight) to scream from window to window and running from room to room. I have called the reception and they received already a lot of complains. During check-out they apologized again and they deduct 1 night from the bill. Overall a nice hotel but we expect more for US$ 249.- ex taxes per night."

"Review_12408","hotel_144","hotel_10470","Jul 28, 2008","Great stay at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf Our family of 3 spent 3 evenings at the Hyatt while visiting San Francisco for pleasure, during mid-July. We stayed in a 1 BR suite, which offered a separate bedroom and generously sized living room featuring a large plasma TV and pull-out couch. The hotel is decorated in minimalist, contemporary style (so be sure that this is to your liking), but is still comfortable. The housekeeping services were thorough and the room was always in tip-top condition after it was serviced mid-day. The location allows a quick 5 minute walk to the Fisherman's Wharf area, and about 10 mins to Pier 39. The historic Trolley is immediately behind the hotel, offering quick access to Nob Hill, Chinatown and other areas of the city. Our only complaints would be that the elevators are frequently crowded, causing long waits to go only 2-3 floors. Stairs are not accessible but would alleviate some of the waiting guests in the lobby area. As well, street noice is a problem if your room is at the front of the hotel. We got used to the noise from buses, motorcycles, etc after a while (which seemed to calm down after 10pm or so), but if you are sensitive to noise then make sure that you request a room at the back of the hotel or facing the interior courtyard pool."
"Review_12409","hotel_144","hotel_4637","Jul 26, 2008","Overpriced, Overated, Just OK I travelled with my Wife and 6 month old daughter. We booked a King Room trhough Priceline and thougt we got an amazing deal. We arrived at the Hotel at around 11PM pm on a Thursday night. The check in took longer than ususal even though there was no one in front of me. The staff showed no sense of urgency even thought my baby was crying after a 12 hour journey to San Fran. When we finally did get the room, after an extremely long walk throught the crazy long hallway, we were impressed with the moderness of it. However, after inspecting it further, we hated it. The window was facing the bright lights of a 24 hour gas station and did not even have black out blinds to keep the light from coming in. Secondly, there was no bathtub and the sink was shallow - no bath for the baby? The shower did not have a covering so the water would splash out to the floor. Also, there was no shower head as the water come out from the ceiling right above your head - straight down. Since it was late, we decided to deal with it in the morning. MY wife went down the next morning. We were told that all King Room were the same - only shower. Our only choice was getting a double bed room since all the Suites were spoken for. After debating this over with the wife, we reluctantly agreed. The guy did give us breakfast vouchers for our entire stay but the breakfast sucked!!! We ate their twice in spririt of saving money. The place across the street, Hollywood Cafe had an excellent breakfast.The double room ended up being better for the family situation and we were pretty comfortable for the rest of the trip. Staff was firendly - great location if you like the wharf stuff which we hated. What's the big deal with San Fran anyways. The shopping was good but we found the food not so good. I don't know what the fuss is all aboat but I'll never go their at my expense again.Been there, Done that, will hopefully never do that again. I definately didn't leave my heart in San Fran."

Staff was wonderful--allowed me to leave my rental car there after I checked out so I wouldn't have to find parking elsewhere. When I checked in, the room they were going to give me had two beds--I asked for one with just a king bed. No problem. Location is great. Area seems safe for a big city. Hotel bar had good food, late. Very quiet. Room overlooked 3rd floor pool, but never heard any noise from there. The drapes completely blocked out any light, allowing me to sleep in. Reasonable price for a Hyatt in a big city with a good location."

The staff were friendly and very helpful (concierge gave us great directions, suggestions for things to do/see, and assisted us with a car rental). Because we were staying for a while, we were given a complementary bar fridge which was great to keep drinks and snacks fresh  cold (there's a supermarket just a short walk away), so this was a great cost savings  totally convenient for those late-night cravings. Moreover, because we reserved on the hotel site using our AAA membership, we were given a great rate, as well we were given complementary buffet breakfast for two every morning were were there (approx. value $18/day X 2 = $36/day) . Totally recommend this hotel to travellers wishing to be in the heart of the Fisherman's Wharf area!"

We said ok but as we'd be staying several nights could we change the following day - we were told sure no problem.Got to the the room - it was next to elevator on the secound floor!! Immediatly I called down and got us another room on top floor in a quieter part of the building - why couldnt smiling Steve at the desk do that first instead of lying to us that it was a quiet room?!Next day we reuested a king size room and got one on a quieter level - all in all a good hotel IF you get over the staffs sparkling smiles and BS at checkin.Sports bar was better that expected and food was very good. Valet parking very expensive at $40 per night.A good spot for tourists that want to be close to Fishermans Wharf and is right beside the start for the tramline into the citys main shopping areas.Nice clean rooms and what has to be one of the BESTgym systems in a hotel I've used.One more thing, the queen sized beds are a joke - Im 6'3 and not exactly small but even my wife at 5'6 struggled to get a decent nights sleep!"

"Review_12417","hotel_144","hotel_10236","May 28, 2008","Less art more function I just got back from a two day stay at the Fisherman's Wharf Hyatt and while the hotel is in a great location and the staff was extreamly friendly there were issues with the rooms, mostly the bathroom. Here's a idea, bathrooms are a tool for your stay they need to provide a function and when it's over designed for visual appeal it looses the function. A two inch deep sink does one thing... it splashes water, most of it on you. As for the shower it has a recessed shower head in the ceiling, I am 5 10 and can adjust it my friend is 5 5 and she had to get on her tip toes ,someone who is 5 3 or shorter better bring there tooth brush into the shower and poke at it if they want to adjust it. It is also in front of the of the shower handles and the shower door does not slide. This means you have to turn the water on standing under it for a nice blast of cold water until you can dive out of the way or until it's warm enough to get back under. Some other things might help this hotel get the 4 or 5 rating the would like and that is don't let the city or whoever position a giant dumpster in front of your hotel. Not only is it a eye sore it's very loud when items are thrown into it. There are a lot of places on that street that are not occupied 24/7 and how about a mini bar?? I know when I booked the room it didn't have one and it didn't bother me from my computor... It did bother me when I wanted a drink when I got to my room.Overall the rooms were very clean, the staff very nice and the location is great, some small changes and the hotel would be great also. Until then it's just a little above average."
"Review_12418","hotel_144","hotel_2519","May 28, 2008","Good Hotel, Nice Location Our family of four stayed at this hotel over Memorial Day weekend. Overall we enjoyed our visit. The hotel was well located - very close to the cable car line and within a few blocks of Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf. Be bought 3 day Muni passes which gave us unlimited use of the cable cars, street cars, and city buses. For $18 each, we thought that was a bargain.The rooms were large enough, clean, and appeared to be newly remodeled. The kids loved the big screen TV and I-Home. However, they were disappointed that they did not have a DVD player in the room (or even any to loan out for use). After a long day of touring San Francisco, it would have been nice to relax with a movie that everyone could see (we brought some movies but had to watch them on the laptop). The beds were nice and comfortable. Even though there were big parties going on at the hotel, our room was quiet. We also were able to use the pool and hot tub one day, which is a treat for an urban location.The service at the hotel was friendly. The concierge was helpful with directions, but not so useful when it came to things like restaurant recommendations. When we asked her for breakfast options, she really pushed the hotel restaurant. However, after walking around, we found plenty of choices nearby.We crammed as much as touring as possible into our long weekend 鈥?the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Chinatown, Hait Street, Lombard, the farmer鈥檚 market at the Ferry Building, Nob Hill, Union Square, and of course Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf.

I work in the Hotel/Resort industry and have a very particular eye when staying at other hotels, and the Hyatt was wonderful! The staff were helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. The Concierge booked our trip to Alcatraz very quickly, with no hassle at all. Our bartender, Clayton, fixed us the most delicious (and strong) Mai Tai's all night one night during our stay. He also told us about a wonderful restaurant called Sardini's on Columbus Ave. It was the best Italian food I've had in years! The rooms were modern and decorated very nicely. Loved the bedding, and the shampoo/conditioner/soap in the room (Lavender citrus). My one and only complaint is that the hot tub closes at 9pm. We got home from dinner and wanted to take a dip because San Fran can get very chilly, but it was already closed. The courtyard where the hot tub is located is surrounded by hotel rooms so they probably can't keep it open late because they don't want to disturb these guests, understandably. We had a wonderful Mother/Daughter vacation at the Hyatt, and please tell Clayton we said THANKS for the Mai Tai's and for telling us about Sardini's!"

Bathroom was gorgeous, although I could have done with a door or some way to completely close in the shower because it got a bit chilly! That said I couldn't fault anything, there was everything we could need and more. I was very impressed to find laundry facilities for guest use, which may not be useful to everyone, but for people like us travelling to a few different places and travelling light it was helpful to say the least. On our last day we hired a car for the next leg of our trip and needed to go back to the hotel with the car to collect our belongings. The valet let us leave the car at the front entrance, free of charge, until we had brought the stuff down. This was great, and to me showed me what I was paying the extra money for. Location was fab, we were within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf, both Cable Car turnarounds, Lombard St and a short ride to downtown. All in all, FAB FAB FAB! I would definitely recommend it.

I found the Union Square area pretty grotty and there were lots of homeless people bothering the tourists for money/food.

Luckily we ignored her advise and went to the game to buy tickets at the gate for a 1/4 of the cost she qouted..hmmm makes you wonder.The knucles bar was dire..breakfast was ok, although service not that great.

The property was immaculate, well designed and very well maintained and service was excellent. Every staff member I encountered was very friendly. The close proximity of the hotel to the Fisherman's Wharf also makes the hotel's location very appealing (but, in fairness, there are lots of other hotels in that area also). My only crticism of the hotel is that the walls between guest rooms are very thin. I could clearly hear the conversation of the two women in the room adjacent to mine. Next to cleanliness and scent (i.e. no smoke odors, which unfortunately I often encounter even in non-smoking rooms) my second biggest peeve are paper thin walls; which unfortunately this hotel has. Otherwise though, a very nice hotel."

Booked a package price on Hyatt.com web site that included one night parking ($39) and breakfast buffet for two in attached sports bar that was wonderful ($35)....

I arrived late that evening and was upgraded to the presidential suite because there were no other rooms. I was particularly excited because the hotel had recently been renovated and the lobby was gorgeous. It was a very nice blend of traditional and contemporary decor in light cream/beige tones. The presidential suite had also been renovated, but was done so in very dark, masculine colors (burgundy, black, and greys). It was definitely a guy's hangout, not a place that most women would want to be. To be fair, it was well appointed, with a sitting area, powder room, a lounge area (all ready for a poker game) with a very large screen TV, separate bedroom with another Samsung flatscreen, a dressing area, and bathroom with whirlpool. The hair products were excellent. Room service breakfast came quickly and was very good, although the allegedly fresh-squeezed juice was not. Excellent service all around. My chief complaint? Every light had compact fluorescent bulbs in them. I know they are environmentally friendly, but the light they give off is absolutely depressing, particularly with a cold and stark modern decor. It just did not make for a very warm, pleasant environment. . I may start bringing my own lighbulbs (just a few) on trips from now on. . . ."

Our room was large, nicely decorated, and in tip top shape. Almost everyone was very nice and non-pushy. The valets outside were helpful with directions and information. Check-in was pleasant. Our only minor objection was a concierge who was not helpful and acted as if she was getting paid to push a particular restaurant. We didn't eat at their restaurants so we can't comment on that. In summary, we would stay again."

Buffet breakfast was good and staff was helpful (although they now have these automatic self check inn/out kiosks and you barely speak to anybody). Still there are plenty of cheaper hotel around that offer a great service as well, so, if you're not planning to stay at your room for too long i wouldn't recommend this hotel, in my opinion its pretty overpriced and they charge extra for everything (internet, water, etc.). Smaller and cheaper hotel give the same for free and cost a third of Hyatt's price, its not about being cheap, cause i do think that service and comfort must be paid for, it just that i don't feel this hotel is so much better than the other ones to justify its price."
"Review_12435","hotel_144","hotel_2272","Feb 25, 2008","Nice Stay We recently spent 6 nights at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf. As several reviewers have pointed out, the hotel has undergone a renovation. We found the rooms to be clean, decent in size, and the beds very comfortable. We requested a refrigerator and a rollaway which they were happy to supply at no cost. A wireless connection is $9.98 per day. The staff was very friendly. A nice bonus was the washer/dryer on the floor. The Hyatt has a nice sports bar called Knuckles which has a pool table and shuffle board. The menu has burgers, sandwiches, salads, as well as some nicer main course entrees. The prices are not cheap, but on par with a typical hotel restaurant.There are several hotels in the Wharf area from nearly every low to mid-tier chain. If you want to stay close to the Pier and Alcatraz (especially with young children) and get decent value, this area is for you and the Hyatt will acheive your objective. If you want to get a real feel for San Francisco, I'd probably stay in the Union Square area or maybe Nob Hill."

The hotel also has an outdoor pool and hot tub, but I did not get to use the facilities as it was too cold.The hotel's location is in the center of Fisherman's Wharf and convenient to the cable cars and other transportation to the business district of San Francisco. There is a supermarket and a drug store a block away from the hotel.The staff at the hotel was very nice. The front desk staff was very pleasant and welcoming. The bellmen were helpful, arranging transportation for me to a business meeting outside of the city. The hotel has a sports bar/restaurant - Knuckles. It is said to be a historical location. The food was good (although not great_ and the service was very good. Generally, its burgers, sandwiches, and the like, although there are some higher-end offerings.All in all, if you are looking for a nice hotel in the Wharf area of San Francisco, I would recommend this hotel. It is much nicer than other hotels that I have stayed at in the Wharf area. The only caveat I will mention is that the Wharf is very touristy and reminds me of being at the Jersey Shore (which I quite enjoy also). If you are looking for a more upscale area, stay in Nob Hill."

We had 3 burgers and three cokes and the room service bill was over US$80.00 .If anyone is staying there i recommend the little cafes across the street(food was quite good).

As background, my husband and I are 30 and we traveled with our 1 year old daughter. This hotel was great - for kids or for people traveling without. The rooms looked newly remodeled and were very sleek, modern, and clean. They were as spacious as you can get - we didn't feel too cramped, even with a crib and all the gear that goes along with traveling with a baby. Great location - about 2 blocks from the main part of the Wharf. We liked that because it was easy to get to everything, yet far enough away it was quiet. There is a great breakfast place right across the street called 'Hollywood Cafe' - we had our best breakfast there of the trip - and you never would guess it just by looking at it."

I asked for it to be looked at while we were out. When we came back the unit was simply turned off. It was never looked at. As a result, we had an engineer in our room at 9:30 in the evening when we wanted to call it a night after a long day of touring wine country. The engineer told me he gets this complaint all the time, but there is nothing he can do to fix it. He told me I should just turn it off if I want it quiet to sleep. After he left, the wall unit actually fell out of the wall. He had to come back to push it back in. Niiice. The entire hotel is small and dirty. I stay at Marriotts to get away from these sort of dumpy conditions. I would have rather been a bit further away and had nicer accomodations. The real thing that makes me angry is that when I booked through the Marriott 800 number, I asked them which was better, this or the one on Nob Hill. They gave me no indication that this one was such a pit. It's actually rated as a catagory 6 by the Marriott company. There is NO WAY. Certainly not the way I wanted to surprise my husband with a romantic getaway. Spend a fortune, fly 5 hours. Arrive by limo and stay in a hole. What an enormous dissapointment."
"Review_12450","hotel_145","hotel_7445","Sep 22, 2008","Nice hotel for a quick business meeting. Stayed at the Marriott San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf for a quick business meeting. This is a medium sized 4 story hotel that is between the Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach Areas. Small lobby, small bar area and a small sit down restaurant greet you when you check in. Check in was very efficient and quick. They have only two elevators and there is often a wait--catch them going down to go up! Stairs are not available for use between floors for some reason. Once you get up to your room there can be a bit of a walk to your room.Rooms are average sized--separate bathroom with shower-tub combo, bed, desk, table, chair. Minibar in room, no safe was available. Coffee maker available. I was on the third floor facing Columbus Ave. and was worried about the noise, but did not hear anything at night! Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable.Used the small gym which had a couple of flat screen TVs, a couple of treadmills, single elliptical and a single recumbent bike. A few machines and free weight sets were available. There are two laundry machines in the gym area. Fresh fruit and water were available. No one was staffing the room.Meeting rooms were good for our meeting. Rooms are downstairs from the lobby and they had connecting stairs.Food in the restaurant was OK. The food issue is not a big deal, if you are visiting San Francisco, you will always be eating out!Location is good given the proximity to the Fisherman's Wharf area and a few block walk to the Italian North Beach area. Concierge set us up with a local Italian restaurant--very nice place. If you take public transportation, the hotel is nearby bus routes.Valet parking is available--about $40 dollars a day. There is no self parking.Hotel was very busy when we were there--a combination of conventioneers and bus tour groups. The lobby and the elevators were the bottlenecks in the hotel.Would I stay here if I wasn't on a business trip? Probably not, can think of other places I would want to stay. But for a quick business trip it was OK."

The front desk staff hardly responded when we checked in. Handed my room card and pointed towards the elevators did not smile or extend any welcome. The evening concerge acted like i was disturbing him when I asked for info about places to see in Napa.On the second night my daughter left a Tiffanys neckace in bathroom on returning she found it missing when we called the front desk they abruptly transfered me to housekeeping who replied they knew nothing about it. What a suprise! No one ever called to address this theft. Which brings me to the issue as to why there was not a safe avail in the room?

I stayed here for 3 nights and found the staff to be unfriendly  inexperienced and the hotel generally dirty and outdated.Let me break it down for you.Front Desk  Room Service: The front desk would not answer phone calls nor would room service. To place an order for room service you must leave a message detailing your order and wait for them to call back. On average it took about 30 minutes for room service to call back. When room service items were placed outside the room, they were not removed for days. You could see various plates with leftover food, bottles of wine, coffee cups and all sorts scattered throughout the hallways. This occured every day during my stay.Lobby Bar:Beware of the bar. On my last night at the Marriott I went down to the bar for drinks. There was only one bartender and she was clearly overwhelmed. She was not familiar with many cocktails and was surly with guests. I don't blame her, she should have had help. At one point she had to leave to get ingredients from the kitchen and the bar turned into a chaotic mess.For $300 a night, you would expect this hotel to be clean  comfortable and the staff friendly  experienced. When visiting SF again I will not be staying at this Marriott."

First off, I called the hotel the previous night to confirm the payment and make sure the charges were to be on the specified card. When we got there, Michael (rude hotel staff member) told me in order to check in I would need the original credit card and photo id. The problem is my mother kindly agreed to pay for the stay. So we had to call my mother at work, have it faxed over and wait. Keep in mind we had to catch a alcatraz trip in 15 min. When I asked how to get there, I was told its 10 minutes walking distance. I said well ok that still doesnt tell me much? Then he said oh its pier 39. That type of short service is very typical of the staff here. Even when we got back from alcatraz I asked to speak to a manager (Alexander) which wasnt any better. When I told him of my unsatisfactory service he told me well now that your better and calmed down from earlier you should talk to our concierge staff to show you some stuff to do in san francisco. Yeah like I'm going to take advice from the unhelpful hotel staff. To top it off my mother called the night before check-out to say they charged her WAY too much. I spoke to another manager (from England) who told me in the most blatantly disrespect tone that he knows what he is talking about and my mother is wrong about what is being charged to the room. Now I think MY MOTHER KNOWS what she is talking about when it comes to what is being charged to her credit card. Its a shame I had to deal with this on my birthday weekend especially when I wanted to stay at the argonaut hotel instead but it was booked (for good reason). Avoid this hotel as it has the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!I wrote the previous posting the night before check-out thinking that was it but I was wrong. The morning of check-out I went to take a shower and was about a minute into doing so when the water from the shower head starting coming out in pulsating spurts which then turned to it spewing out YELLOW WATER. I immediately turned off the water and told my boyfriend to look as the water came out yellow (in addition to the faucet). We called the front desk who said they would send an engineer to fix the problem. Since we had plans for the day we told them we need to shower in another room. 30 minutes later a maid gave us a room key two floors down at the end of the hallway to shower. There was no explanations given or apologies for the inconvienience by the management whatsoever. Due to the ordeal we were unable to do what we had originally planned. I truly hope in writing this review others can be spared from theseexperiences."

The highlight of the trip was the concierge, I believe his name is John. He provided us with restaurant recommendations that were spot on to our interests and tastes, and always gave us great directions to attractions. I would highly recommend this location to anyone who wants an enjoyable stay in San Francisco."

"Review_12469","hotel_145","hotel_9833","Mar 15, 2008","""Great location but expensive"" We visited this hotel as a gift from a very generous uncle. The hotel had the clean, high standard finish you would expect of any Marriot. The location is literally 2 minutes from fishermans wharf but the hotel doesnt benefit from any stunning views of the wharf or the golden gate bridge from any windows. It has an almost dwarfed apperance and in honesty looks more like a motel; It is only once inside you see the luxury. We had a hire car with us and were told there was no where to park in the vicinty and had no choice but to take advantage of the hotels garage which we thought would be free or at a discount at least for residents...but it actually cost 拢45 for 2 nights parking!! Our room cost alot and this on top was extortionate espcially as my partners uncle was paying for it I couldnt enjoy our stay as much thinking about it. On the upside our room was great and the bed very comfy but purly on extreme lack of value for money I would go else where next time."

Hotel concierge was very helpful in selecting dining locations and all were above expectations. Bedrooms were ample in size and comfort. Bed linens were fresh each day and the room tidy and restocked appropriately. Room service was fast and the food above average. Enjoyed the sitting area near the bar with the fireplace and table service from the bartender. Friendly staff. Excellent breakfast bar but a bit pricey. My husband and I would happily stay here again and recommend it to any traveler. One drawback was the significant walk from the elevator to our room. If walking is a problem, travelers should specifically ask for rooms closer to the elevator. But, that's a nit when you are away from home for vacation. Great hotel."
"Review_12472","hotel_145","hotel_9692","Feb 8, 2008","Highly Recommended Great location, quiet area, with easy access to cable cars, buses, or street cars, and we walked a lot too. The staff was very nice across the board. The concierge gave GREAT recommendations on restaurants; he hit the mark 3 out of 3 times, exactly what we were looking for at the moment. We especially recommend the Steps of Rome Cafe on Columbus St. (next door to a sister restaurant, the Steps of Rome Trattoria which we hear is good also, but more expensive.)We also recommend the Pescatore Cafe, near the hotel, and also Alioto's on Fisherman's Wharf. We were delighted by the beautiful gardens on Alcatraz, the view of the city skyline from the now closed prison, boat trip over and back, and self-guided tour of the place. We also enjoyed the nearby dockside tour of the liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien, and submarine USS Pampanito. The Muir Woods (redwoods) site across the Golden Gate bridge was inspiring and also the Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen (Sonoma Valley), and their practice of sustainable and biodynamic farming, plus their fabulous guided tour and wine tasting. We rented a minivan right around the corner from the Marriott (Avis) for about $100 for the day, and drove to Muir Woods, Sonoma, and Glen Ellen, and ended the day watching the sun set over the Pacific from Golden Gate Park. Happy days."

It was clean, had a fabulous bed, and a courteous staff, but it was definitely not a glamorous place to stay. That is probably a result of the location. I personally didn鈥檛 care for the Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf area. It was dirty, commercial, and I didn鈥檛 feel comfortable walking around by myself. Maybe it would be nicer in the summer and fall, but I would not recommend it in January. Overall, the hotel was nice, but I would not stay there again based on location.

Weather aside our stay was excellent. The accomodations were better than expected. The room, on the 4th floor(of a 5 story facility), included a refrigerator, was clean and roomy. The bathroom was large and the shower worked well. The staff from the front desk, bellmen as well as the phone and housekeeping personnel were responsive and helpful. The concierge team(3 different individuals) were extraordinarily helpful.The in-house restaurant was a litle pricey but the breakfast buffet was excellent. The hotel was near 2 cable car routes as well as 3 buses that basically took us all over the city. We did not rent a car because, in part, parking at $40(+14%tax) for parking was outrageous. There were 2 supermarkets within 2 blocks which were able to meet all of our needs.By the way we are both light sleepers and I must say the rooms were quiet.I would recommend it."

We were always greeted on entry. The hotel's location is an excellent position within walking distance of all the attractions such as Pier 39, Alcatraz tour  Sightseeing tour buses.The City  Alcatraz tour bus picks up from the hotel.Some things were expensive such as items from the mini bar and bottled water but we didn't use any of these.We did have breakfast in the restaurant one morning and it was very good for the price. The chef in there was quite a character.Parking is also very expensive, as it is in all of Fisherman's Wharf. I think it was $38 per day + tips for valet only parking.Parking did not worry us however, as we parked our car in a multi story near Budget Hire on Beach road. It was expensive at $20 a day with no in out privalages but half the price of the hotel.The car park was about 10 mins walk away.I would certainly stay here again."
"Review_12477","hotel_145","hotel_1564","Jan 2, 2008","OK hotel with good location A good location to Fisherman's Warf area is definitely the big plus of this hotel. The hotel itself is a big run down in areas. I found the staff hot or cold - some staff was really nice and helpful while others (like the omlete guy at the breakfast buffet and one of the front desk workers) were downright surly. Rooms are well equiped with coffee maker, robes, nice toiltries, iron and a TV. Daily internet charge is a pain and should be included in the price. Workout facilities were quite nice and clean. Daily valet parking was a bit steep at $40/day, but was reliable and fairly quick. The breakfast buffet was pretty low quality and uninspiiring (basic danish, toast, cereal, eggs, fruit, etc.) for the price and the variety did not change much daily which is a bit dull if you are staying a few nights. Not a bad hotel, but a bit low for Marriott standards."

The view outside the window wasn't very nice - main street in front - and was very noisy especially at night. The room itself, as well as the shared bathroom and toilet, were very clean.

The Mosser has a fabulous location for walking around the city and is convenient for public transit. The hotel is very charming and I found all of the staff to be friendly and very helpful. My only complaint would be that my room was not very well insulated from noise, but that is probably due to the age of the original building with its victorian architecture. My room was very nicely decorated and very clean. The shared toilets and shower were also spotless and I never had to wait to use either of the facilities. Great value and the hotel staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Be sure to check out the daily rate special on The Mosser's website for a great price."

We had pre-booked this 3 star Hotel because it was affordable and central. It was just right for our needs, with a pleasant marble floored lobby and efficient staff. Muffins and coffee for breakfast. The room was compact but adequate, and there was a Jazz CD gift in the room produced by the owner. We opted to book a room without a bathroom, however the toilet and shower facilities on our floor were modern and clean. The Mosser has had an ungrade and so it has old Victorian charm and a modern freshness too. Within a few hundred metres you have diners and restaurants, picture theatre, the Cable Car, trams along Market Street, Union Square and the main shopping centre. If you are looking for 3 star comfort, reasonable price and a central location, then we are happy to recommend The Mosser."

I got a queen room with shared bath for $109, but after numerous difficulties with the card key to the room door not working properly, was upgraded to a queen with private bath right across the hall. Nice to get the Gillette Venus disposable razor as one of the amenities.Even though I used the shared bath for just the first day, there was never a wait and both the toilet room and bathtub/shower room were spotless! I never even saw anyone else using the hall bathrooms. Friendly, couteous staff. The mini muffins and tea/coffee were nice in the mornings. I felt as if I were the only guest from the U.S. staying here--lots of Europeans seemed to stay there. The Hotel Palomar next door looked more swanky (and $$$), and the 39th floor Sky bar across the street at the Marriott was fun for a good view and a drink, but this was the best value by far, since I'm a girl on a budget. Would stay here again."

Although the rooms are small, they are nicely decorated and reminiscent of a European boutique hotel. The best part of the hotel is the service. The staff is well informed and courteous, and, because the hotel is small, one never feels overwhelmed or rushed. The location is great too. It's right around the corner from the major shopping districts and transportation hubs. A nice restaurant next door, and an excellent breakfast diner down the block are also added amenities. If you're willing to forsake room size for good service and a nice price, you couldn't do better than the Mosser."

"Review_12490","hotel_146","hotel_5654","Nov 5, 2008","Stay here only if you plan to spend NO time in your room Location - superior. Immediate access to everything that the Bay Area has to offer, or at least immediate access to access, with MUNI and BART lines only a block and a half away.Rooms - taller than they are wide. A bed around which you can just about sidle; no desk; no closet; no bureau; a corner sink in the bedroom; a bathroom with tub, toilet, and a square yard of other space, most of which is within the doorsweep. I found myself placing bits and bobs (a plastic chair, a tray, a bizarre vase and artificial flower) out into the hall for the maid to carry away. The decor: Classic mottled hide-the-stain mixed browns, hiding the many stains with only indifferent success. Remarkably depressing, and with window-rattling street noise even on the eighth (top) floor.Stingy amenities - free coffee and muffins in the morning, all very well, it's not a bed-and-breakfast, after all; but oh, the cheeseparing of making the guests sign on every day, at $9.99 per day, for access to the Internet! One clerk said - It's not that bad, there's a three-day special fee. But when I went looking... No. One day at a time. On reporting that to the same clerk, he said - Huh! Did they pull that? Guess it wasn't making enough money. And there you have it, eh?Staff - Well-informed and chipper at the front desk. As for porters, chambermaids - one lift only, so that you must be prepared to wait for it to pass you by several times until this and that cart has made its way up or down. Better training might have ensured that they step out of the cab when a guest wants to use the lift."
"Review_12491","hotel_146","hotel_9131","Oct 29, 2008","The tiniest rooms ever! We booked the Mosser as I thought it looked like a gorgeous boutique hotel when I found it on hotels.com. When we arrived there we were really impressed with the exterior of the building and the lobby is absolutely gorgeous - beautiful architectural details.It was only when we got to the room that we realised the mistake that we had made. The rooms are quite stylish but they are absolutely tiny. I had read lots of reviews on this site before booking and figured that when people had said the rooms were small that they were exaggerating. There was just about 2ft on one side of the bed and less than 1ft on the other side. At the end of the bed there was about 3ft. As myself and my husband both had suitcases (mine was a small and his was a medium) we couldn't open our cases in the room without putting our cases on the bed and there was no wardrobe to hang things (well there was a 1ft rail but my husband hung 3 shirts on it and it was full!). Also attached to the end of the bed was a shelf with a tv perched on it, which without fail, I kicked repeatedly during the night (and I'm only 5ft 3). Also, the view out of our window was of other rooms - about 6ft away, so we had to keep the blind closed at all times.The Mosser would be an alright place to stay for one night, but after 3 nights there I had cabin fever from the size of the room (even though we were out early every morning until late in the evening seeing San Francisco) and I was so glad to get out of it."

Its location is ideal, right by Union Square in the heart of downtown, close to BART and the MUNI transit systems and of course the shopping. Upon my arrival at the hotel, the bellman asked for my name and it was obvious the hotel was expecting me. That's very organized. The bellman took my bags into the lobby which is very quaintly decorated. The old style decor is well preserved and maintained which adds to the charm. Checking in was simple and my room was immaculately clean. I didn't mind the size of the rooms (it's an old hotel built in the early 1900's) nor did I mind sharing the bathroom/shower facilites. I'm a budget traveller and I had no problems with using the shower facilites. (they are private so there is no communal shower to worry about) The front desk staff were very helpful in providing information during stay. I'd definitely stay there again."
"Review_12494","hotel_146","hotel_5069","Oct 23, 2008","European-style hotel, good price When we started looking for hotels in SF, the big price tags were a shock. We went through otel.com and got a pre-paid $128/night rate, which was excellent and suitable for our room at the Mosser. It is centrally located near the downtown shopping district and many other hotels. It has a beautiful art deco style lobby and a stylish decor throughout. Our room had a private bath, but there seemed to be ample shared bathrooms on every floor for those rooms that did not have a private bath. It is definitely a European-style hotel though - the average American traveller will find the rooms to be quite small. We are not large people, but we did have two large suitcases and the room felt very cramped - especially the tiny bathroom. But for one night, it was fine. There was normal city noise from outside. No air conditioning, but we had a fan which was adequate. The room was very clean. The front desk was very helpful, supplying us with a sewing kit when we needed one, and the porter was efficient. Organic apples were at the front desk, which was a nice touch. They also had basic pastries and coffee in the morning. Our one issue was with the parking service. Since we had rented a car for our entire trip, we had it with us in San Francisco, which was a bit of a problem as parking is scarce. The Mosser apparently has some kind of parking garage off-site which charges guests a daily rate of $28 if I recall correctly, with unlimited in-and-out valet services. Although we called down to request our car 20 minutes before we needed it on two occasions, it was not ready when we came to the lobby, and we had to wait 10-15 minutes for it to arrive each time with no explanation. On one occasion, when the car arrived, the stereo had been tuned to a different station with the volume cranked, and the gas was lower than how we had left it. This made us wonder. In general, leave the car at home when traveling to SF. Being from Boston and New York, we thought we had seen high parking prices - but the SF meters start at 5 cents per minute, and the garages are worse. All in all, the Mosser was an economical way to stay in SF and worth considering."
"Review_12495","hotel_146","hotel_9274","Oct 21, 2008","Good place if on a budget. This place has its good points and its bad.The good: Close to everything downtown. If not ,you can always fond public transportation within steps of this hotel. The underground MUNI system is right around the corner, so are the Cable cars on Powell St, and the Bart. Any of these will take you pretty much anywhere a tourist wants to go. Don't rent a car! Buy a MUNI pass good for 3-5 or 7 days, which is what I used and was well worth the 24 dollars for a 7 day pass.If you get a shared bath room, dfon't worry, they are always clean. I never had to wait to use one or the shower. Everytime I looked inside it was spotless. Also the smell of the hotel is very nice. I like the air freshener system they use in the place. Lots of places to eat all around and Walgreens and plenty of ATMS too.The bad: It can get somewhat noisy depending what side of the hotel you are on. I constantly heard beeping noises coming from an underground parking garage, and I was on the top floor! I also heard a whistle noise almost like a choo choo train, but its a type of whistle the doormen use to hail taxis! Its cute at first but after a while it can be annoying. Also in the morning housekeeping are noisy. They use storage bins in the wall which they open and close constantly to stock up supplies and they bang it open and closed all morning. I was in room 803, and 802 is literally right next to your door. Tucked in a corner. My neighbor had a bad habit of slamming their door when they left or came in. Very rude.But I would stay here again, but this time a bigger room and maybe in a quieter area. The price could not be beat."

The room was well equipped with even an iron and an ironing board and a wash basin. No view though. We were also close to the ice machine on the second floor of hotel and it was somewhat noisy. The shared bathroom was OK. I was initially a little grossed out just by showering in the same place that somebody else was, but it seemed nevertheless sufficiently clean. It was not clear to me how many rooms shared this bathroom and shower. We only stayed in the room for three nights. I would probably prefer my own bathroom in the futuree, but if you can bear showering where somebody else did and you want to save on accomodations so you can spend on other things, this is a top choice.

We stayed the last weekend of August 2008 for a quick mini weekend vacation on the cheap. So glad that we decided on the Mosser. Yes the rooms are small, big enough for the queen bed and small sink area with a little walking space... very european, but what are you doing in the room in an exciting city like SF? The hotel had everything that we needed. The shared restroom and showers were always clean, the staff was very welcoming and helpful during our stay and the location cannot be beat for the price. A few blocks to all the shopping you could ever want (Union Square), and right off of Market street and all the public transportation needed to get around the City.I will definitely stay at the Mosser every time i visit SF."

The staff is outstandingly friendly. I was pleasantly surprised to find a continental breakfast available in the morning, and there's great shopping around the corner. If you're headed to SF, particularly if you're spending your own money (and not on an expense account) you'll love the Mosser."

During my stay the staff were friendly and helpful when you needed them to be.The rooms are comparable with more expensive 'boutique' hotels i have stayed in, and are both clean and comfortable.There may be bigger and better hotels, but the Mosser provides great value for money and i would have no qualms about returning there next time i am in town"
"Review_12507","hotel_146","hotel_8069","Sep 16, 2008","Over priced, rude, rooms are tiny and cheap looking We arrived and our room was $160 plus tax which we found to be ridiculously overpriced for the room we stayed in. It was not even a Queen bed, we were told it was a Double but that seemed to be a generous statement. The room was smaller than one at Fomule1 and there was stains on the carpet. I had forgotten my cell phone charger and went down stairs to see if front desk had one to fit my phone, I was then talked to like I was a thief and untrustworthy and was made to go back up stairs to bring my phone down so he knew I wasnt just going to take it which was very insulting. There was meant to be muffins for breakfast but there was none left at 8am. I was also charged $1 for each 1800(toll free) number that I had called which I have never seen before as it is a free call.Overall it felt as if we had been ripped off and we really didnt enjoy our stay at all and will not be returning in the future."
"Review_12508","hotel_146","hotel_6546","Sep 14, 2008","Good location, small room We stayed at The Mosser hotel for three nights, and chose it primarily for its central location and price. Despite the extremely small room, there was a CD player, TV, games console and wash basin, and our bathroom was situated across the corridor, so this wasn't a major problem. The hotel overall has a quirky but smart decor, with a nice foyer serving coffee and muffins at breakfast. The location was great as it was situated a few steps away from Union Square, Chinatown, the business district and the shops of Market St."
"Review_12509","hotel_146","hotel_1563","Sep 8, 2008","Clean, Convenient, Safe, Good Rates Okay - I liked this hotel because it's really convenient to the BART (1 block to Powell Station) and other public transportation (street cars, trolley cars, MUNI buses). It's also VERY clean and safe. I booked through Expedia and got a great rate, but I booked a European style room - no toilet or shower in my room, they were in the hall. And this worked out fine for me.Here's what you need to know before booking this hotel: The rooms are small but well-designed. They are nicely decorated in what I'd call a High IKEA style. The European style rooms have a sink, hair dryer, bath robe and iron + ironing board in them. The closets are small. The rooms have ceiling fans but no central air conditioning - usually not a problem in San Fran, but you do need to keep your window open to get some cool air. Since the hotel is so conveniently located, the downside is that it is also noisy - more so when you have your window open. Right now (early Sept. 2008), there is construction going on right in front of the hotel. With jackhammers. There is also a parking garage right next to the hotel, and every time a car exits the garage, there is a BEEP-BEEP-BEEP while the arm is up - and you CAN hear this if you're on that side of the hotel. There is also a restaurant on the first floor (not connected to the hotel, and I think it serves lunch/dinner only + it has a large bar) - one hotel guest told me that his first room was on the 2nd floor right above the restaurant and it was quite noisy. He got a room change. Some rooms are noisier than others, so request to move to a different room if yours is unbearable. The hotel serves coffee, decaf, hot tea and muffins in the lobby every morning from 7-10 AM. The front desk staff, while very polite, is mostly brand new and not very knowledgeable about restaurants, getting around town, etc. Except for one guy: John. He is great and he is usually there in the mornings.If you don't bring a laptop, you are kind of screwed as far as getting internet service: you CAN get internet on your in-room TV, but it costs $10/day. There aren't any terminals available for your hourly use, and it's kind of hard to find an internet cafe - but I did locate a grotty one on Post near Hyde St. But bringing your laptop is probably the cheapest option - there are tons of free wireless hot-spots all over town.As far as the European-style stuff: the restroom and shower are SPARKLING clean. All the time. There may occasionally be a brief wait to get into the shower, but nothing unbearable and certainly not a deal-breaker.Overall this is a well-run operation and very clean, convenient, safe and affordable. I would definitely stay here again."

If you are claustrophobicdon't even think about staying here. Small rooms, shared bath, broken elevator, TV on a stick coming out of your bed, broken AC and you can hear all the noise from the street. I'd rather stay at the Y.

"Review_12512","hotel_146","hotel_3319","Aug 28, 2008","Perfect for a night away Nice modest hotel in a perfect location if you want to be down town. Market street has some not so nice areas but 4th Street where the Mosser is nice and safe. The hotel is easy walking distance to the Ferry Building and Plaza, a block from MUNI and BART and easy freeway access. This is a typical European old school hotel with very modern rooms. The place is well run, clean and comfortable. The in house bar and restaurant were both great. Both have very high ceilings, nice woodwork and a classic design.The rooms are small and may not be ideal for a family or if you are traveling with lot's of luggage. For a single person the rooms are fine. My room had triple layered window which kept all the potential street noise out, high quality bathrobes, fresh flowers, nice linens and pillows, and quality soap, shampoo etc...If I was spending several hundred dollars I would expect all of the above. My room was $119. For that price this is the greatest hotel deal in San Francisco hands down!!!I'm in SanFrancisco often. Now my only regret is I will not get to try any other hotels. I'm coming back :)"
"Review_12513","hotel_146","hotel_4535","Aug 27, 2008","Affordable Getaway We stayed here for 6 days, 5 nights. It was affordable and clean. I wouldn't stay here if you are used to a luxury hotel, but it's a great location in downtown near shopping and you can ride the muni or bart to pretty much anywhere. We caught the bart from the airport to the hotel and it was only $5.35! We loved being so close to the Cheesecake Factory (yum)! It is much better than Fisherman's Wharf where all the tourists are and prices are higher. The rooms are pretty small, so if you are rooming with someone make sure you don't mind living in close quarters! We used the community bathrooms and they were always clean and never occupied. They also give you a shower caddy so you can carry your toiletries to the shower which is nice. You have a sink in the room, which is also nice. I enjoyed our stay here and I would recommend it highly for anyone wanting a reasonable stay while in San Francisco!"
"Review_12514","hotel_146","hotel_5535","Aug 27, 2008","Nice stay at the Mosser My boyfriend and I stayed for two days at the Mosser from 8/23 - 8/24. We had room 608, which had a queen bed with bathroom and closet. The room was neat and clean with stylish, modern decor, but it was extremely tiny, although I expected that from reading other people's reviews. Just be prepared for a 2-3 foot perimeter around the bed, and that's it. Not much of a view, but you're in the city center, so that was also expected. It was reasonably quiet, in any case. Nice TV with cable, CD player, a chair or two, trashcan, and a nighttable was all that was in the room. There is no A/C, so we kept the windows open, which was fine. San Francisco usually has pretty temperate/cool weather.The bathroom was also tiny; standard tub, toilet crammed in right next to it, and sink across from that. Decent water pressure, plenty of hot water. I didn't much care for the sink though. It is about the size of a urinal, and there is a shelf right above it, so you can't splash your face with water without hitting your head on the shelf. Also hard to spit when brushing your teeth. Overall, it wasn't too bad though; just annoying.The lobby looked really nice, and the staff were friendly and pleasant. Breakfast was minimal - just coffee and muffins in a basket in the lobby, but the muffins were pretty good. We went around the corner to Mel's Diner on Mission St to supplement our breakfast - great food, cheap. Annabelle's Bistro was right next to the hotel, so we stopped in there for drinks in the evening, and it seemed like a good, local hangout. The location was good in the center of downtown. It was one block to Market Street with tons of shopping, restaurants, big office buildings, just a few blocks from San Francisco Bay. You can get to/from the SFO airport easily using the BART subway system, which has a stop just around the corner from the hotel on Market St; it was a $6 ticket/25 minute ride straight there. We used the MUNI system of trolleys to get around otherwise, which was also just around the corner and cheap at $1.50 anywhere you want to go on the line. The F line was our friend and goes all the way out to Fisherman's Wharf in about 15-20 minutes with stops at the piers along the way. We paid cash (exact change required) to the driver each time, but you can also get a MUNI card, which might be a little cheaper, depending on how many rides you take. As far as fun things to do, we had a car for two days ($35/day to park at the Mosser) and traveled to the Napa/Sonoma area one afternoon and hit a few of the wineries for tastings. It took about an hour to get there, and most of them close by 5 pm, so don't get up too late. Beautiful scenery, nice wines, tons of vineyards to try. The next day we drove to Muir Woods, which is an ancient sequoia forest with a walking trail. That was amazing; I felt like a dinosaur would come lumbering out from amongst the giant trees at any moment. We also hit the five-course Cirque du Soleil-style dinner show, Teatro Zinzanni at Pier 27/29; great food, great show - not cheap, but we thought it was worth it; book ahead. My favorite sidetrip was a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. We rented bikes from Blazing Saddles at Fisherman's Wharf for around $45 each, and it was a simply astounding ride past Ghirardelli Square to Fort Point, over the bridge, and down to the cute, little village of Sausalito, where we took the ferry back across (ferry ticket included in price). Took about 2-3 hours total.  Okay, back to the hotel. We also stayed four nights at the Queen Anne in Pacific Heights about 1.5 miles away, and both of us liked the Queen Anne better to be honest. The price was about the same (~$150/night), but the Queen Anne seemed more authentic to San Francisco, extremely cool, relaxed neighborhood (Fillmore district) with lots of neat boutiques and no chains, the rooms were 5x bigger, they had a better, more expansive breakfast, better bathrooms, and very reasonable access to transportation. However, if you really want to be in the bustling city center, convenient access to everything is the most important factor for you, and you don't mind being in a more corporate-y area, then the Mosser is the place for you, and is very reasonably priced for its location, especially if you get the rooms with the shared bathroom in the hall."

One sleeps and rests and leaves or maybe watches a little tv but why the need for a stadium size rooom??As a frequent European traveleur I find cleanliness more important that size the the Mosser was indeed clean and fresh and non smoking!I hope that this place lives on and on with it very reasonable prices!

"Review_12519","hotel_146","hotel_10205","Aug 15, 2008","Nice room, bad staff Myself and friends of mine booked twin rooms for the Mosser from 27th July X 4 nights. We in fact got double rooms but this was ok as it didn't bother us too much. The staff on check in were not friendly and welcoming as they could be and the concierge (door man) was pretty much useless with not even so much as a smile to make you feel welcome at all. We booked the rooms with shared bathrooms and even though the rooms were very small they were comfortable and clean and had a sink provided. The shared bathroom wasnt bad either and there was never any problem with a queue for the shower or toilets.Our friends had a problem with their door during the stay where the lock had died and after 5 or 6 trips to reception to get the problem rectified they had to move the room (they did not believe us and gave us new keys each time previous to this), My friends were left with everything in the room which couldn't be opened for the night and had no night clothes, no access to medication etc. This could have been a major inconvenience and the fact that the hotel were powerless to open the room until the following day should never be the case for health reasons if anything else. I would advise that the members of staff recognise that they are there to sell the hotel and welcome guests as I found their attitude towards us was cold and very unhelpful. I had to go to the concierge in the neighbouring hotel the Palomar on any questions I had who were wonderful and if I had not prepaid for the Mosser I would have liked to have stayed there instead."

You literally bang into the phone on the wall every time your try to get into the closet.Also the sink which is not located in the bathroom is so badly designed that you risk knocking yourself out on the protruding glass shelf above everytime you wash your face.We also had a problem with a stuffed toilet -- which is pretty embarrassing to begin with -- it only got worse when we had to call the front desk twice to get someone to fix it.Also at check-in the staff is trying to be so cool that they come across as downright cold.If you are staying alone - the room could work -- with another person way too small."

From the website it sounded like a great place, more boutique than typical chain hotel. After having some difficulty navigating the confusing one way/no left turn streets in the area, we managed to find 4th Street and quickly park with the valet service. Once inside, I was happy to see its small size and quiet lobby, staff were helpful. The room was on the small side, but had everything we needed and was clean, efficiently layed out and even hip. The bathroom was tight space wise, but manageable - a coffee maker would've been nice in the room, but there was nowhere it could go. We did have some questions about services (drink machines, check out time, etc.) that I had to ask the front desk about, but other than that our stay was very comfortable. I didn't hear any noise during the night either from the hallway or adjoining rooms, it was great not to have doors slamming, loud voices, etc., as in most hotels. I would definitely recommend this hotel, it is in a good location for shopping, entertainment and close to public transportation and gives a more European feel than a typical American hotel - more intimate and low key."

"Review_12528","hotel_146","hotel_9684","Jul 26, 2008","Great location, tiny room The Mosser is less than 30 mins from the San Francisco airport, and less than 30 secs from shopping and coffee on Market Street. Union Square, the major shopping area with loads of restaurants, is within 5 minutes' walk. In short, great location. You can get most of what you need as a traveler, be it shops, food, entertainment, and transportation. It's convenient location, however, also means it's on an extremely busy spot. The noise at night can be annoying, if you are a light sleeper or have jet lag like us. We could hear clearly people on the street, traffic and the occasional sirens. The room we had was more a shoe-box with a small double bed. We could barely move around our room with the 2 big suitcases we were travelling with for our 2-week vacation. The bathroom was literally the size to fit in the tub and the toilet. The sink was stuck in a corner in the room; and it's the smallest sink one can ever imagine. We chose The Mosser because it was right across our rental car pick-up point, and the price was right. It was only a quick 2-night stay before we moved on to drive around Northern California, so we were ok with it. I won't really recommend it if you are planning for a longer stay; unless if you plan to shop till you drop and party hard everyday. (You won't really notice the size of the room or the noise if you are dead tired...)"

It's been my home away from home as a single traveler in San Francisco since I found it about five years ago. The location is ideal, just off Market Street a few blocks from Union Square -- BART, buses, trolleys and cable cars all nearby. The hotel is in an old building with high ceilings, is very clean and well-maintained, and is simply but pleasantly furnished yet has everything I need. The staff without exception have been pleasant and professional, helpful, and just plain nice. I choose to stay in the shared bath rooms, and that has been no problem. The rooms are not large. The shared bath single might feel a bit cramped if you plan to spend much time in the hotel -- in that case, go for the shared queen -- but I'm in town to experience the city, not the hotel, and just need a clean, quiet place to sleep and shower. I'm not a fan of big American motel chain rooms. The Mosser is much more comfortable and pleasant! This is a hotel that puts the emphasis on the things that matter. I'm glad I found it."

On two of the visits I varied my length stay at short notice and was able to get the same room for extra days. I loved the decor of the rooms - clean and modern style - none of the fussy, floral / cottagey stuff! There was also great service at the front desk. A bonus was being able to book a reliable shuttle to the airport directly with the hotel - this is much better than having to deal with SuperShuttle, who require 24hrs notice and for the customer to book via a 1-800 number, and they sometimes do not arrive on time...I would definitely stay there again!"

There was a sink in the room, which was really convenient. The TV was pretty tiny, but there was so much to do that we only spent an hour our last night watching it. I never had to wait for the lavatory or the showers. The front desk attendant who checked us in was continuously helpful; we asked a few times for restaurant recommendations and were quite pleased each time.

The location is superb - very safe compared to just a few blocks further down the road (I had friends staying on 7th St off Market and the difference was marked) and also within walking distance of just about everything you'll need. The service was exceptional (I also stayed at the Whitcomb - avoid! - and the Hilton - so, so) and the little touches, like the free muffins and coffee for breakfast, very welcome.

The location is central and safe. There are good food and drink options nearby. They do free coffee and muffins in the foyer in the morning. I ate in the bistro next door which was quite nice. The rooms are tiny. The TV is tiny. I used the shared bathroom option was is fine. Air flow and temperature in the room was hot/cold but I find this a problem wherever I stay anyway. I'd recommend this hotel and would stay there again!"

The staff was friendly and helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. The shared showers and toilets were very clean as well. The hotel is also in a very good location that is close to tourist attractions and public transportation. My trips to and from the airport were only 30 minutes long via BART. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."

I'm originally from the City and have known of the Mosser (especially the dive hotel it was back in the 1980's). What a transformation! It's a beautifully designed, well appointed and friendly staffed hotel. The employees are very helpful and knowledgeble (overheard a desk clerk explaining our California Mission system to a foreigner), though not overly solicitous (with hand out). The location is perfect. Bus to the ballpark is right in front. Excellent restaurants within walking distance; the Metreon for movies. The MOMA around the corner and of course, Dave's Bar on 3rd...best beer deals in town; always has the game on and a great Juke box! Rooms are small, but perfect for what a busy or active traveler needs. Our room had a small chair that had a swing table on the arm and a foot rest that slid out, perfect for working on the laptop. Flat screen TV, dvd and stereo. The famous one on Nob Hill doesn't even offer that! We definately will return; we get up to the city often and have found a new pad in the Mosser. I'll recommend it to everyone heading to the City. The better hotels should take notice! Mosser, Great job!!"
"Review_12542","hotel_146","hotel_5682","Jun 11, 2008","Love the Mosser! My husband and I have stayed here numerous times on business trips. It is a great location, very accessible to all areas of the city and activities, impeccably furnished, and makes great use of its smaller sized rooms in a beautiful old Victorian building. The bar restaurant and staff are just as fantastic. Finally, it's priced very reasonably, costing much less than chain hotels with far less attractive rooms and atmospheres. And, in the meantime, you're in a bustling area of downtown with lots of nice local bars, restaurants, and stores nearby- instead of stranded out on Fisherman's Wharf with all the tourists and overpriced mediocre food. A great little boutique-style place."

I was amazed at how comfortable and clean it was considering the price. We had one room with a double bed which although compact provided all we needed. Using the shared bathroom and toilets was never a problem and they were always clean. Staff were great and informative. Very close to get the tram to the wharf. Also spent every morning just around the corner at Mel's dinner for breakfast which was yum. Was not disturbed by noise inside or outside the hotel. Would recommend to anyone on a budget who is just looking for clean, good priced accommodation in san fran. Good place for single/couple travellers or other fellow single parents!! Would stay there again :)"

From the moment that I arrived at the front door of this hotel, conveniently located on 4th Street in San Francisco, I was met with great customer service and a welcoming attitude. Michael, the valet, was very helpful in arranging parking accomodations for my car and handling the luggage. I noticed that he took extra time to advise other guests about directions to specific locations that they wanted to visit. The front counter personnel were also very helpful with visitors out of town that were looking for sites to see and the best way to get around.This is an older hotel that has been updated where updating was necessary but has kept it's charm and architecture from years past. The appointments in the room are very modern with flat screen LCD television, nice lighting fixtures, fan, double pane windows that actually open, and a great use of limited space.The hotel has complimentary coffee, tea and muffins in the hotel lobby every morning, which is a very nice way to start your day. The hotel is right next to a great newer shopping center (Westfield) and many other shopping attractions and restaurants.Overall, this hotel is a great value and I will definately stay there again. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a convenient and cost-saving place to stay when visiting San Francisco."

It's a boutique style hotel in a renovated old building located at Market and 4th in San Fransisco.When we arrived (early) our room was not quite ready so we were upgraded to a queen bed, which was awesome. All the staff were really nice and friendly, check in/out was very efficient.The rooms are definitely small but are really well designed and if you don't need a lot of space the place is ideal because it is super clean, the bed is comfy and room rates are really good.

The rooms were small but I didn't expect they would be huge. Regardless, we were very comfy and relaxed. The staff seemed reserved, professional, and friendly. They seemed to enjoy their job enough to make you feel comfortable. If you want fancy dancy and snobby go somewhere else. We found the Mosser wonderful and extremely relaxing even with the window open and the noise below.We took Caltrain from Sunnyvale and walked to the hotel, only 12 minutes. It took less then 5 minutes to the cable cars. We had diner very late at one of the jazz clubs nereby and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere very much and the fact that are hotel was a few minutes away was great.

"Review_12550","hotel_146","hotel_5896","May 26, 2008","great value but noisy halls The location is the absolute best part of staying there. You don't have to manuever through throngs of crowds to leave or return to the hotel like you do with some of the more higher end hotels in union square. It is very close to public transportation and in walking distance to a lot of great places such as the Metreon, California Center and union Square. The staff was very professional, accomodating and knowledgeable about SF. I stayed in a room w/ a queen size bed and private bath, which was comparable in size with similar rooms in the city. My room faced the front but the street noise was hardly noticable. The only reason I give it a neutral rating is because the hall noise was distracting. Noise traveled across the hall from the opposite hotel room. It was very much like staying in a dorm. I stayed on a holiday weekend so that may have contributed to the noise factor, The staff sent security once which made a big difference but other guests in other rooms seemd to have started making noise once the others were told to be quiet. This is not a place for light sleepers . If you are a heavy sleeper or are willing to trade off quietness for good value then this is the place to stay. I'm sure earplugs or headphones would help to."

The Mosser is a beautifully presented hotel, within walking distance of almost everything you'd want to see in San Francisco. The rooms are small but well equipped and excellently maintained. The staff are friendly and helpful, no matter what time of day or night. A light breakfast of coffee and muffins is set out in the main lobby each day, and there's always a bowl of fruit to help yourself to on the front desk (a nice change, when you've spent a week indulging in Disneyland snacks in Anaheim!). Although the hotel is close to many, varied, restaurants, including China town, the hotel restaurant itself (Anabelle's) had fantastic food...and coming from Melbourne, I'm pretty biased! On the whole, a great place to stay to explore San Francisco and to get well looked after by people that know the city well."
"Review_12559","hotel_146","hotel_4992","May 1, 2008","Great Hotel for the price After reading the reviews before going on my trip, I was a bit wary, but my opinion changed once I got onto the property. The lobby is beautifully (perhaps my taste) decorated in Victorian style. The room was small, but adequate. Coming from Manhattan, I thought the space was good. My friend and I booked a deluxe room with 2 twin beds, which means that we had our own bathroom. We both weren't feeling well when we arrived. (Thanks, AA :S) We rested for a while before we walked to fisherman's wharf. We're New Yorkers - we walked! All the tours were done by that time, but we did by a bottle of wine on our way back. We mixed our wine with juice and cut up our fruit (we packed fruits due to no food on our flight) and soaked it to make sangria while we went out for a burrito. Our sangria was perfect when we returned. Perfect for putting us to bed. We had muffins (complimentary) and coffee the next morning and checked out. We checked our luggage in storage and explored San Francisco until we traveled to our next destination. We left the luggage at the hotel for 12 hours, and had no problems retrieving them. Our room cost 119.00 plus tax and my friend and I divided it by 2 so it came out to about the same as a shared room. We had a pleasant stay, slept with the window's open and had no problems whatsoever. We didn't take any pictures of the room, sorry! Drunk people should not operate cameras. . ."

The Mosser was recently remodeled, they kept the best of the old,  added all sorts of new things compacted into the rooms in a way that they didn't seem to subtract from the limited space. I noticed  loved all of the little details that they added, since I had stayed there years ago by myself when I was at another conference. There was a full bath  plenty of hot water. We had a sense of privacy, it was quiet in spite of being right downtown. My husband is disabled, but we were so close we were able to walk just a few blocks to the Embarcadero, farmer's market, Union square, cable cars, Moscone center, Museum of Modern Art and a multi movie complex, not even 1/2 block away! We found handicap parking right on the street, but they offered 24 hour valet service for a reasonable price. The staff could not have been more helpful, they were friendly  inviting. And on top of everything it was spotlessly clean, I wasn't afraid to sit on the bedcover or walk on the carpet without my shoes. We will stay there again."

The entire hotel was immaculate.to include the community hall bathroom stall and community single room/stall shower And, I was able to stay in the heart of San Francisco, Union Square, for less than $70 a night! The room was small, but plenty big enough for one person, two if you were a couple. For those who have traveled to Europe....the room was the same size you would get in one of the more premier hotels. The bathroom was all granite tile and so was the shower room.

If that is what your doing and don't plan to stay in the room a whole day, this place is for you. The bathrooms were kept very clean, cleaned twice a day. Check in went smooth and quick as did the check out. They were helpful getting shuttle service to the airport.There is nothing I can complain about this hotel.

"Review_12567","hotel_146","hotel_8754","Apr 10, 2008","Look beyond the surface The Mosser is in a central location to the main shopping district and has a gorgeous lobby, but once you get past those things it has a lot of problems. I had a room with a private bath (the others share small bathrooms on each floor) but the room was tiny. I barely had enough room for my suitcase to lie down. But I was not there to spend time in the room so you could cope with that if that was the only problem. The staff are rude ad arrogant and when asking reasonably simple things you get quite an attitude. During my stay my electronic key deactiviated. After trying it several times i returned to the front desk to request assistance and the front desk clerk just gave me a look and said well did you try it slowly? which I did not feel was an appropriate response. Also, this place is noisy. My room overlooked an alley where I am pretty sure everyone in San Fran parked their motorcycles so all night you were irritated by the noise of motorcycles coming and going. Also, the staff seem to run the place. Everytime I tried to catch the lift it was held on floors or full of cleaning/maintenance staff who just kind of look at you when you want to use the lift. They need to pull their staff in line. But overall, not terrible for the price if you are on a budget. Just pack earplugs."
"Review_12568","hotel_146","hotel_1542","Apr 9, 2008","Small and quirky, but a great bargain Overall, the Mosser is a good little hotel, in an outstanding location. Anything else in the Union Square area is far, far more expensive. Just remember that you do get what you pay for. The room I was in was absolutely tiny. I knew it was going to be small, but I was rather unprepared for the size. The photo which shows the platform bed is basically a photo of the entire room. A little bit of floor space, a small closet, and a sink is about all you get. Interestingly enough, the tv is mounted on the wall above the sink, though it makes watching tv in bed easy and comfortable. However, the hotel offers savings on bookings of a week or longer and I ended up paying only $50 a night for the room. Moreover, everything was very clean, tidy and comfortable. It was well worth the money, particularly in terms of location. It is just feet from the Market Street streetcar line, a minute's walk to the all-important cable car terminus, and a very brief stroll to Union Square, major shops, and SFMoMA. This is a good deal for a room and the location is wonderful."

It's a boutique hotel in the SOMA neighborhood (not far from Union Square) that occupies an old Victorian. The hotel is very attractive from the outside and the lobby. The neighborhood is definitely the plus to this hotel. You're paying for the privilege of staying in the area and not much more. In my research, I found The Mosser was one of the most reasonably priced hotel in the area, but it's still very expensive. The rooms are frighteningly small (and we have stayed at some European hotels with pretty small rooms), my husband and I were literally tripping over each other while we were getting ready. They try to make the most of the very small space by having a flat screen TV, no dresser, small end tables, no counter in the bathroom, etc... But there's only so much you can do when the room is very, very small to start with. The front desk people were very friendly, and we did appreciate that they let us check in early. The hotel's decor was modern and trendy, but carpets and bedding are showing some signs of wear and tear. It really comes down to value for me, and I think that it's just not worth it to pay the money to stay in this area. We stayed at a place in Cow Hollow/Marina District the night before, and the room was literally twice the size and half the price of our room at the Mosser. I would suggest if possible, stay somewhere else and cab it back and forth to SOMA or Union Square if you need to be there, you'll still have money left over at the end of the day."

The per night had been $150 but when we extended stay from original 5 nights to 7 nights, the rate went down to $75 a night. I knew from reading reviews on here that the rooms were small and pretty basic, so we weren't expecting much more. We also knew that they had only coffee and muffins for breakfast and that Internet was $10 a day. Doing your homework keeps you from being surprised, I guess.But we were surprised - pleasantly so. Our room [#621] faced 4th Street, but with the double double windows, the room was not really noisy. You could hear street sounds, but at night, it was quiet enough so that sleep wasn't disturbed.The room had a bay window, but no window seat. We kept our suitcases in that area and they were out of the way. We had a flat screen tv which worked well.The room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. The sink drain was a bit slow, but we managed. There were just 2 sets of towels, but that was ok too.The mattress was not a heavenly one, but we were comfortable. It was a mattress on a wooden platform, so it may not be what you are used to, but we slept okay on it. I asked for extra bedpillows and got them right away.The hairdryer didn't seem to be working on the first morning, and I told the front desk about it. They had someone come up to check on it within about 30 minutes. It was the working when he check it - apparently the GFI thingy had to be reset [I thought I had tried that].Staff was pleasant and we thought that we had gotten the deal of the century.We would happily stay again at The Mosser and we would recommend it without hesitation!"

Strange since neither of us had noticed it. We returned to the hotle where we had left our bags in the storage room. The deputy manager accused us of stealing the television. He was extremely rude.

The tiny corner sink was impossible to wash my face in. Great coffee and muffins in the morning, great location as it was close to shopping, eating, a neat little park and a great aquarium."

I found my room comfortable, well equiped and as quiet as you could hope for in the center of a big city. Steps from buses, cable cars and the BART, it really is the best starting point to explore this city. I appreciated the ceiling fan, sound-tight windows and fresh apples every morning. Great experience."
"Review_12581","hotel_146","hotel_9666","Jan 8, 2008","I left my heart at The Mosser! I booked this hotel after looking online. I didn't have a clear idea of which neighbourhood I wanted to stay in. For going in blind I couldn't have been any luckier than finding this great hotel! It ended up being the perfect location for me, close to all transportation, and withing walking distance of so much. I always felt safe, no matter what time of day I came or went. I LOVED the room, and the staff were beyond helpful. There was a great restaurant next door, and when I come back to San Francisco, I won't even look for a different hotel. I'm staying here again!"
"Review_12582","hotel_146","hotel_1815","Jan 1, 2008","Good, but a few issues... We met up with a friend in San Francisco and he booked this hotel for us so the first I knew of it was when we arrived (after spending 2 weeks driving from New York). The hotel is in the business district but is good looking with a nice lobby. The area has a few bars and restaurants but it's also well located for public transport to all the other areas so it's a decent location. The inside of the hotel is clean and well decorated, the rooms are spotlessly clean but are tiny - most have the sink in the bedroom as the en-suite shower room is a (well) converted cupboard. The beds are also small by American standards but are comfortable. Unfortunately we did encountera few problems whilst staying here - firstly, when we arrived we were given our electronic room key (swipe card style) however when we got to our room it didn't work. My husband went back to the lobby and returned with a member of staff who also tried the key before agreeing that, we were right, it didn't work. My friend sympathised as he had experienced the same problem when he had checked in the day before. The staff were helpful though and immediately moved us to a different (slightly bigger) room, where the key worked perfectly, until we returned from a night out! We tried to get into our new room and had the same problem as earlier. My husband and I returned to the lobby and explained our problem to the receptionist who had some issues understanding us. For some reason she insisted on checking her computer and then announced that there was no one staying at the Mosser that night with out surname! This was quite a surprise as, we explained, all our belongings were currently locked in a room several floors above our heads! After repeating ourselves several times (each time met with a polite if slightly irritating smile!) before my husband had to go out for some air. I decided to write our surname down for the receptionist in case she had been spelling it wrong (mishearing our M's for N's perhaps?) and finally had some success - she found our details and called for a security guard with a master key who escorted us back to our room and let us in. All in all, this place is nice, clean and well situated but make sure you prepare yourself for malfunctioning room keys and slightly confused (but always polite!) reception staff!"

"Review_12588","hotel_147","hotel_8319","Dec 15, 2008","Roll the dice Sold to the highest bidder is the way this place works. we made reservations months in advance for the first week of december, only to be called a couple of days before our trip and told they accidentally gave our reservation away. in talking to the manager i was told that it was given away by a travel website by accident, so I asked her why she could not call the people who booked later and cancel them and she said she had no contact info on them!!! are you kidding me?. Anyway we were supposed to have the family suite for about $180.00 a night and she said that she could give us a room at their sister property Broadway manor for $140.00 a night. As i was talking to her I looked on their website and saw I could get a room for 3 of those nights for $59.00 a night , 1 night for $99 which she later gave me the discount, but if I had not asked we would have been paying a couple extra hundered for our stay.Instead of staying in a family suite that we booked months in advance in a hotel that we picked because of tripadvisor, we were packed in a standard room of a lower rated hotel. We would have stayed elsewhere but it was a high volume week and we could not get anything reasonable on such short notice.(I'm sure they got a lot more money for the suite). Being pretty mad about this I started checking other reviews and I realized that if you change the tripadvisor search to lowest rated instead of newest, every person who gave this hotel a 1, did so because they were duped out of their reservation. The funny thing is this is the only hotel I have seen with a 48 hour cancellation policy instead of 24.I can only rate this hotel a 1 even though I'm sure it's alright once you actually get a room, but as Seinfield once said  taking the reservation is easy, it's actually about holding the reservation. Roll the dice if you want, just have a backup plan. Would love to hear a response from management!"

"Review_12590","hotel_147","hotel_4095","Nov 30, 2008","Well located, but disappointed by the lack of amenities, the noise and price Stayed here with the wife and kids over thanksgiving week. Owners are nice folks who were full of local info and spent a good amount of time giving me a run down on the transport and sightseeing options. I have tried really hard to like this place but can't help feeling disappointed with the stay. The family suite is huge but there are no family-specific amenities supplied like cutlery or crockery. There is a microwave oven supplied but again no bowls, etc to use inside it. The free continental breakfast comprises a tray of pastries and a fruit bowl in reception. This was appreciated but stretches the definition of a continental breakfast.My biggest complaint is the noise from other rooms. The building is of timber construction and dates back to 1955. We were on the 2nd floor (one above ground level) and the noise levels transmitted down from the wooden floor of the 3rd level above were very high. We were woken at 5am most mornings by the noise from early-rising guests located above. We could hear every voice, footstep, running water, toilet flush, etc.The lack of in-room amenities and the noise levels make the family suite overpriced in my opinion at $184.00 per night plus taxes.On a positive note, the place was very clean and is well positioned with a one block walk to the nearest Powell-Hyde cable car stop."

Motel is a fair track from Powell St (where we arrived) but in a great location, about 10 mins walk (down hill) to the city front - Fishermans Wharf area. It's a a cab ride back as it's uphill.The lady on the front desk was very helpful pointing us in the direction of local restaurants and bars. Russian Hill is just round the corner where the famous twisty street is located. And trams run up and down a couple of blocks from the motel.

"Review_12596","hotel_147","hotel_5992","Oct 3, 2008","Overrated - Look Elsewhere As a an editor at a popular travel magazine, I have found TripAdvisor.com to be a reliable resource for honest, firsthand reviews of hotels around the world. I've relied upon the site dozens upon dozens of times without disappointment -- until now. I can't help but feel that there is some sort of scam going on with the authenticity of these reviews. There is no way that this property deserves such a high rating. This place is overpriced and much further than it implies from the fisherman's wharf area - count on at least a 25 minute walk. Picture the decor and amenities of a dingy roadside motel in the middle of nowhere and that's pretty much what you'll get.Don't be duped on their junior suites which are little more than a room with two queen-sized beds and a dirty couch. The innkeepers are intolerant of any guests who speak in tones louder than a hush. I was traveling with my husband and some friends in our mid-30s and actually had to tip-toe back into the hotel past 10pm, in hopes of not rousing the innkeepers who were quick to complain on several instances. There was a family staying there at the same time that we were who said that the innkeepers had given them a hard time because their kids were being kids. Do yourself a favor if you want to really enjoy your time in San Francisco -- look elsewhere."

I booked directly and had a great email and phone conversation with the owners. The room was great, a big room with plenty of space for three motorcyclists. The hotel is built around a parking area, so free parking too. The place was very clean, furnished well and did not suffer from noisy guests or traffic. The owners were superbly helpful, giving great advice about trams, buses and diners and there is a host of maps and guides there too. The help were very friendly as well and the price was out of this world. A basic buffet breakfast allowed us to fill our bike jackets with muffins and fruit and then be on our way. Far better than Fisherman's Wharf which we found to be seedy and dirty. Two blocks from the tram and then a $5 dollar ride down to the Wharf, cab fare back was around $8."
"Review_12599","hotel_147","hotel_7609","Sep 11, 2008","Clean, tidy and ideal for bus and cable car As the name suggests a great place to stay if you arrive by car. Nob Hill Motor Inn has spaces under the accommodation- safe and just a short walk to the lift.We had a 2 room suite for 3 nights and found it very clean with helpful staff. A short walk to Van Ness Street will put you on the main bus route, and a 5 minute walk will get you to the iconic cable cars. (Leave the car in the garage and go buy a travel pass from The Holiday Inn on Van Ness St. A bargain!)Breakfast is coffee, juice and pastries which you collect from reception then take on a tray to your room. Not ideal but ok.Overall a pleasent stay."

Not very close to any of the main attractions (but that meant we weren't a long way from any of them either) but close to bus routes which could get you to them all, so that was a bonus - and the buses run til 01.00 so not a problem. Staff were helpful. Breakfast was basic - my daughter loved their coffee - we have brought some home with us. You can get away with not having a car in SF, buses, trams get you just about everywhere in the city and there are excursions to the attractions further afield, Golden Gate, Napa Valley, Muir Woods/Sausalito.Recommend a visit to Sausalito - beautiful town with great views back across the bay to SF"
"Review_12602","hotel_147","hotel_7381","Aug 13, 2008","Nice stay We stayed here for five nights and it is in a great location, two blocks from cable cars, approximately 25 minute walk to attractions, such as Lombard Street and Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf, depending on speed going up and down hills! Union square takes a bit longer. It鈥檚 off Polk, where there is a good selection of bars and restaurants. There is an abundance of Laundromats in the vicinity, a Walgreens pharmacy around the corner and there is a small grocery store on the corner. For an excellent Italian head two blocks from the motel and eat in Ristorante Milano. Tangential note, head to restaurants before 9.45pm as we鈥檝e seen people refused entry after this time as restaurants stop serving early, well earlier than we鈥檙e used to in Ireland anyway!The room was spacious and the d茅cor a bit dated. Although the room was clean, there was a damp smell in the room and bathroom. The bed was fairly comfortable, with clean linens. The room had a fridge, microwave, ice-bucket, TV, coffee maker, iron and ironing board. The bathroom was standard and clean. There wasn鈥檛 a separate shower/bath; the bath had a shower unit attached to the wall. This is very acceptable and quite common for us. The only issue was that the shower door opening was too close to the toilet, so manoeuvres had to be made to get in and out of the shower. It would have been more practical if it opened the other side. That's just a little thing. The motel in general was nice and quiet and felt safe. Complimentary muffins, pastries, fruit, juice and coffee, fresh daily, are available in the reception office to take back to your room or if you鈥檙e heading out and about. No dining area otherwise. Parking is free. Just note that the spaces are a bit on the narrow side. There are vending machines and an ice machine in the parking area, opposite reception. Frank and Judy take great care of the premises. They are very helpful and friendly. Frank checked us in and he was a font of very useful information. He pulled out a map and highlighted the attractions, areas to avoid and the location of nice restaurants, including the Italian mention above. We found this very useful to have. This is an unfussy plain place to stay, so if one wants someplace a bit more plush look elsewhere."

But we figured it would be worth it.We had a huge suite with a separate room for our boys. All adequate and clean. Excellently located and great advice from the owners. There was some noise from what sounded like a hen party arriving back at 2 am.Our only gripe was that the room was depressingly dark! It was very hot in SF the weekend we were there and we needed to chill in our room at times - but we did find it simply too dark (one small window facing out onto the inner court).Not sure we would stay again - however we have nothing to compare it to in SF and it is quite possibly a really good motel if you have a car to park and want to be centrally located."

My wife and I stayed here as part of our Californian tour, largely due to the great Trip Advisor reviews and low price (拢50GBP).All in all we enjoyed are stay here, the rooms are very large and reasonably well decorated and in a good state of repair. We had a room over the main entrance which was somehwat noisy. There was a bitt of traffic noise during the day and at night/early morning there were a surprising amount of cars zooming past the room, which did wake us both. The main disturbances however came from the recycling centre next door which seemed to be dropping bottles off at 5am - very noisy.Still, the location is great. Its a 15 minute walk from Lombard St and a further 5 to FIshermans Wharf which is were we spent most of our time. Its also not too far from Union square and China town if you are feeling energetic! There are lots of shops and restuarants nearby and the Pancakes at Polkers on Polk street are the best ever.The staff were very helpful and gave us a map with various items marked on telling us where to go and avoid.I would certainly recommend this motel for those on a budget who want to be right in the centre of SF."

The couple who own it are fantastic....and sincerely interested in making your stay in San Francisco a pleasant one. The motel is very close to the cable car line and the owners will point you in the right direction to transportation, tours, nearby restaurants and (in our case) somewhere to have a couple of drinks after having arrived late. Our stay was enjoyable and, oh yes, lest I forget, our room was comfortable, clean, convenient and quaint (and I didn't try to be poetic..those words just happened to come easily.) But don't expect a Holiday Inn!...this motel is not your run-of-the-mill safe expectations...it's an honest to goodness motel full of welcome and charm."

"Review_12624","hotel_147","hotel_2657","Feb 8, 2008","No Problems We had a room with 2 queen beds, which was enough for my partner and myself, and a friend in the other bed. We had a small fridge (not tiny, sort of waist height) and microwave, and coffee-making facilities. A kettle would have been useful though!It was quiet enough, although yes, you can hear people in other rooms if they are loud enough.Sadly one major piece of 'dirt' (for want of a better word...) was on the toilet seat when we arrived, which was quite disgusting, but other than that the place was clean and the room was cleaned daily (apart from one day when I was feeling ill and asked them not to).Yes the place could do with a refurb but everything worked as it should and overall we had no complaints.The staff were nice and really helpful - they recommended places to visit, places to eat and places to avoid (eg unsafe areas). Thanks too to the Indian man on the front desk who recommended sunset in Santa Monica (where we went after SF), it really made for a memorable part of our trip."

Everyday, we'd begin our day with breakfast from one of those places.The parking spots are free, but tight.

"Review_12628","hotel_147","hotel_8104","Jan 8, 2008","Amazing for the Price We Paid My boyfriend and I stayed for three nights, and were very pleased with our room with a King bed. We paid $65 a night.Pros: As stated in other reviews, the couple that owned the place were very friendly and helpful, letting us know what areas to stay out of after dark, and where some of the better tourist attractions are. The housekeeper was even friendly, and was smiling every time we saw her. She seemed very sweet. The motel is in a great neighborhood, and I never felt unsafe when walking around at night. The shower in the room was fantastic and large enough for two. The bed was really comfortable, and smelled surprisingly good for a hotel bed.Cons: The room smelled really, really musty when we checked in, but after about 10 minutes I didn't notice it anymore, and I never noticed it again during our stay. The free wi-fi was spotty at best, and I don't think that the channel for HBO was ever on while we were there. I think they were having some technical issues though, that I'm sure will be resolved eventually.The only major con was the parking. Oh, the parking. Thank god my man is a good driver, because the spots are _tiny_ and there are poles everywhere. Some nights there were cars double parked in the lot, because there weren't enough spaces. If you're reasonably comfortable with difficult parking though, don't let this discourage you from staying there.Summary:If you can get a room for somewhere in the $60-85 price range, I'd highly recommend a stay here. It's essentially a really nice motel, so don't stay here if you're expect something amazingly spectacular. It made for a great home base to explore the city."

We waited at the lobby along with 5 other guests until 3pm. Once checked in we were placed to a room across the street on the top floor with no elevator. The TV in the room is facing the vanity instead of the bed, the TV remote dosen't work, neither did the voicemail system, iron and ironing board. The curtain has stains on them and so did the bed spread. We finally argued our ways to switch the room to the side where the front desk is. We will definitely never stay at Ramanda again."
"Review_12631","hotel_148","hotel_6984","Jul 9, 2008","Small rooms, Great location I had a one night reservation for a queen bed room in late June at this property. After reading some of the horror stories on this site, I was pleased when I found that my room was located in the main building, and not in the annex across the street. Maybe those rooms are earmarked for people reserving via travel bidding sites? The main portion of the hotel is typical of many roadside inn type hotel/motels in the city. Narrow side to the street, but going back deep. Parking is available right by the office, in a sort of open-air courtyard surrounded by the rooms. Check-in was a breeze, the desk employee even called up to my room 15-20 minutes after I left to make sure everything was ok and I didn't need anything.My room number was in the 200's, but you had to push #3 on the elevator to get there. Little quirky, but no harm done. There's also a fourth floor that was closed off. Perhaps renovations are underway? The room was small, but clean. The cabinets, desk and drawers looked newer, but the bathroom fixtures had obviously been around for a while. No problems with hair in the bed, or insects. I didn't get a chance to try the breakfast, but the internet was quick and easy. It's free, but you have to get the access code from the front desk first.The hotel is two and a half blocks from the Civic Center Muni/BART station. There were a fair number of homeless around, but not one so much as asked me what time it was. I used the hotel as a base between the airport and ATT Park and it worked out great. I would stay here again without any reservations."

The staff was extremely unhelpful when we tried to get the car towed. They could have cared less about our dilemma. We also had problems with our reservations. We booked 2 rooms with two double beds. Instead of receiving this, we got 1 double bed and 1 single bed. We made our reservations with the price of $99 a night. When we checked out they charged us an extra $50 a room because they had to upgrade us because they messed up on reservations. They did not inform us of this upgrade charge until check out. And even if they made a mistake, we should not be held responsible for it. Everything about this hotel from the staff, to the management, to the location, to the conditions of the rooms was horrible. We weren't looking for a high class joint, just a decent place with a decent rate for one night. This place couldn't even deliver that. I can't get over how rude and dishonest the staff was."

We had to booke it since SF was booked up due to Oracle, Openworld and thought, Hey it's a Ramada (name brand), it should be fine. NOOOOO!! We were given the annex across the street and walked in to see a filthy room with dust and crud in back of the bed, bathrooms that leaked and had rusted pipes, carpet that was stained and moldy and the best.. pubic hair in the bed!After a long day at the conference, I pulled back the sheets to find multiple pubic hairs in-between the sheets! I called the front desk and after one hour of called, finally answered and said they would bring a change of sheets. They never came. We then called again and the night person came on and said he never heard anything about our problem. He came over shortly with new sheets and I showed him the hair. I then started to help him make the bed, only to find the new sheets had holes, cigarette burns and spots on them. He apologized and came back with new sheets. I was so sick that I tried to find another hotel room in the city but no luck. We were forced to stay in that room, listening to the shower drip all night. We never slept. The next day, I complained to the front desk and the woman in back of me overheard and said she had the same problems with dirty sheets and hair in the bed. They only gave me a 20% discount and I called the corporate office which is looking into the place. DO NOT STAY THERE!!! The term, 'Fleabag hotel was created just to describe this place!!!"

I removed the sheets as I entered each room and 3 of the 4 were full of hairs. The curtains were stained and the T.V only had 6 channels.

To sumarise our experience: On booking in we were told our pre-booked suite was not ready but booked as requested. A double double on a high floor. Our bags were stored and when we returned later the suite wasn't available anymore. We had to settle for a double and two singles on a lower floor. This meant my six-foot high son squashed into a single bed and his luggage had the other one. He tried the games but stopped when he realised it was an additional charge.The bathroom had a hole in the ceiling and mould as extra decoration. It smelt musty.Lightbulbs were out but there was an abundance of mouthwash. Weird. The noise throughout the night was awful and I resorted to earplugs. Looking back it was the battle to get the room which remains worst. This was not a relaxing experience. Try elsewhere if you can unless you are prepared to stand and negotiate/ argue with the reception.There are better hotels - we found one."

Of course flying across the country, we had called 2 days in advance to confirm our reservations at the Hotel California. After 8 hours of flying and a 20 minute van ride we finally arrived at the hotel to find that they had overbooked our 2 bedroom suite and all other rooms and could not guarantee us a room for any of our 4 nights we were staying. The hotel's best offer was to shack us all up in a single room with double beds in a hotel where the rates were $150 more per night. The only offer the Hotel California made was that they would pay for the 1st night there. They would not budge on their downgrade of an offer which would cost us more money and jam the four travelers in a small hotel room. After 2 hours of standing, waiting, arguing, standing, waiting, and arguing, .... in the main lobby they suddenly had a 2 bedroom suite open up at their hotel. I guess the finally decided to bump someone else because they may be less trouble to deal with. I truly recommend to avoid this hotel at all costs. The manager was no where to be found and requests to talk to him on the phone were declined. Besides these two hours of Chapter 1 in Hotel NO NO's we weren't bothered the rest of our stay. However after their first impression on us all, we didn't expect much."

"Review_12645","hotel_149","hotel_2714","Aug 17, 2008","Probably Not Again This hotel isn't horrible, but it isn't great either. The pictures are a little deceiving. Although they apparently have remodeled recently it seems as though they scrimped on the details. From afar it looks nice, but up close it's pretty shabby. For example, the crown molding isn't repaired just painted over, where tile meets wood flooring it looks like a 2 year old did it, where they have touched up paint they actually used different colors, the carpet is worn and the floors seem sketchy. The rooms aren't huge, but not entirely small either. I will say that we had a room on the 7th floor, which I thought was going to be great. But the windows are so paper thin, and the hotel is in such a busy area it litterally sounded like we were sleeping in the street. I'm not very proficient in busy cities, the sirens and trash trucks, (they pick up trash EVERY day) seemed like they were going ALL night long. The walls are so thin, you can actually hear the tv in the next room. It was my honeymood and arrived early and they would not let us check in early and we were not met with the promised frosty shot of tequilla. The area is good location wise, walking distance to China Town/Warf/Shopping but it is full of homeless people who are relentless in asking for change. Now for the positives.... They offer a breakfast for $7 and it's really good and the best price you'll get. Toast, bagels, cereals, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, sweets, rolled lunch meat and orange/pinneapple/grapefruit juices along with coffee and tea. We weren't ever at the hotel at 4:00 for the wine and cheese reception, another couple did say it was nice. And, they have what has been called the best vegan restaurant in San Fran.

"Review_12647","hotel_149","hotel_6210","Jul 24, 2008","Sweet place I thought this was a great place. We were in SF for a conference in July 2007. At the time the taxi driver took us first to the wrong place, the California Hotel which is about 6 blocks further down Geary (and scary!). We were relieved to make it to this beautiful place--bright, yellow, welcoming. The taxi driver said oh, the old Savoy Hotel. Don't know what it's rep was back then. Also, it's apparently now a Best Western hotel, but I don't think it was when we were there. In any event, we loved it. Very european feel to it, and clearly very recently remodeled (so maybe it used to have a bad rap). Cute yellow rooms with quotes from songs stenciled into the ceiling molding. Very small room, don't get me wrong, but it's a big city right and you can't have everything? Small but really well furnished. The bed was great, and there was a comfy pleather chair. The bathroom was very nice, and pretty well sized. Because it's SF in the summer we had to open up those double-hung windows to let the glorious 58 degree air in while we slept--BUT, that made it pretty noisy (and we weren't even facing the street). We found out later that there's a major hospital about 20 blocks west on Geary, so all the ambulances coming from the Union Square area zoom past the hotel with sirens blazing. But seriously that was not a big deal. Plus, there's tons of stuff nearby, you're only about 3 blocks from Union Square, can't beat that. Oh, and the wine and cheese thing in the afternoon was really nice, we just sat in the small lobby and met some really interesting people (one guy from Australia, and some locals from Napa or someplace waiting to eat at the apparently well regarded (4 star or something) vegan restaurant adjacent to the lobby)."

The rooms weren't excessively large, but they were adequate considering that you don't really spend much time in a hotel room anyway. Two of the gentlemen at the front desk, Duane and Tony, were both extremely helpful. They were both incredibly friendly and on several occasions helped us find different locations around town that we were interested in, giving us what turned out to be good advice.The wine and cheese in the afternoons was a nice touch, as was the complimentary shot of tequila.Overall, our stay at the hotel was very pleasant."

On the other hand, the price was right and the room was good. Management needs to take the plywood off the elevator door and fix it up--it really looks bad."

I stayed here May 14-17 and hated this hotel. The whole place smelled of pee - it made you gag when you walked in! And if it smells like that then it can't be clean surely? There was a heat wave when me and my husband were visiting and the rooms are horribly hot with no air con. We could not open the window as the kitchen fan or something similar was right outside on a flat roof and this sounded like a train driving into the room so we just had to sweat! The elevator was not working for over 24 hours when we arrived so we had to carry our own bags up the stairs to our room - not easy as I had a broken arm so could only use one arm.They advertise a cocktail on arrival - we got none. There is a wine and cheese thing every day in reception which would be great if you like sweaty cheese and warm wine.This hotel is horrible and I wish we had stayed somewhere else. Avoid it if you can."
"Review_12651","hotel_149","hotel_1825","May 18, 2008","Not what we'd hoped. Having read reviews on this site I chose this hotel carefully. I was aware of noise at night and the lack of sound-proofing, so requested a 'high' floor and a double, double suite. On arrival we were assured this would be ready in a little while. We left our bags and went to explore the city. On our return the rooms had been allocated to other guests. We had to accept a lower level suite, which also meant that one of us had to sleep in a single bed with a spare one for the bags. Lucky bags, unlucky 'six-footer'.The Reception had obviously caved in under pressure from other guests (who we met later- and they had complained, so got the upgrade!).Unfortunately, the 'night -music' I'd read about, did wake me at 3am and after a while I found my earplugs and I got sleep. The windows were overlooked (about 12ft away) from offices, so the wooden blinds stayed down even in daylight hours, keeping out light but not draughts.The bathroom wreaked of mould, looking up the black patches were huge and obvious. The whole bathroom was well overdue for renovation. I suppose you could say it was in keeping with the style of the hotel - small and needing a 'shake-up'.The Breakfast was a strictly vegetarian choice, so not even an egg in sight.The Millenium Restaurant was exceptionally busy and even with a reservation we had to wait for our table. Service was excellent.The menu firmly revolved around beans and every kind of pea imaginable. The plates were a sea of green and beige. Deserts were fabulous, maybe we should have skipped the main course and had two or three deserts. In summary, an expensive meal, but a stylish and good-vibe restaurant.My advice is, if you are Vegan or strict vegetarian then this is a venue for you. For others... look elsewhere for a more comfortable stay. As a footnote, the next day I recognised the 'music' which had kept me awake at night... a homeless man stood outside the hotel with a white cassette player. Maybe not homeless, he lives in the space between the hotel and the office block below the bedroom windows!"

The staff was always friendly and helpful. The complimentary wine and cheese receptions were a highlight, with California wine! We also had free round-the-clock coffee and hot tea. There's a great lobby with huge comfortable chairs, and a media room at the mezzanine level with additional seating, a computer, and a printer, where I was able to print our boarding passes. Another guest computer is available at the front desk. The free high-speed wireless was wonderful. (I always resent having to pay $10 a day or so for wireless access at pricier hotels.) From the music in the lobby to the pictures on the walls, the decor set the mood: very vintage San Francisco, with curving, carpeted stairways, high ceilings, and hardwood floors, with a definite European feel. The hotel was built in 1906 but underwent a major refurb a year ago. Our yellow room with blue and white bedding was not large, but adequate. The safe in the closet, big enough to hold a laptop, was no extra charge. The bed was more comfortable than those in pricier SF hotels. We also had a flat-screen TV. The shower had great water pressure and no shortage of hot water. We stayed seven nights and could not have been more pleased with this hotel. The hotel has a great restaurant (the place was hopping on Saturday night), and there are many others nearby. The location was terrific for us. This hotel was the best bargain we've ever had in San Francisco."

Has one of the best vegetarian restaurants I have EVER experienced (I'm picky and a meat eater and I was entirely satisfied).

Playful lobby music had me bobble-headed and wiggly while awaiting the elevator, complimentary shot of tequilla upon check-in (come-on guys - buy some Patron) actually launched my vacation. Rooms are tiny, but completely adeqaute. Baths are basic, comfy, totally tight and clean though not state of the art. I had a nice flat screen on the wall, my traveling companions had a big bulky CRT. So it's inconsistent, but nothing is BAD. Who owns this hotel? So Invest a little more, would ya please!The neighborhood ranges from homeless army-of-zombies to the coolest hotels I could imgaine. I landed here cuz I coudn't get a room at Hotel Nikko or the Clift Hotel. OK - not the same place at all. And yes I figured these were neighbors - so I'm Stupid. . Still - I was pleased and laughed cuz I was trying to find a 4 star wowzer. This isn't a snooty 4 star - but neither is it self-absorbed and pretentious, unlike the Stanford Court which I stayed in later, (4 stars and looks like it was decorated by Lady Bird Johnson in 1964).Like almost every great hotel - it's the line staff who make it great. Buildings are ho-hum; smart helpful people make travelers feel connected and safe, and therefore - adventurous! This hotel has that sort of staff. Thanks to you all."

I had stayed in one of the renovated executive king rooms of the hotel. The room itself was nice since it had been recently renovated(art deco design). The other added bonus was the large size of the room. It was 310 sq feet. That was pretty much the only positive of the hotel. I had originally booked the room through the hotel's website and at that time had also signed up for the hotel's rewards account. Upon arrival of the hotel, not only did the staff personal that helped me check in tell me I had not applied the rewards account, but had also refused the look at the confirmation letter I had printed up after the reservation online with the rewards account clearly on the reservation. Since she had a [--] attitude and did not want to really wanted to be bothered with, I went ahead and continued to check in an got my keys to the room. Upon arrival of the room, it look nice, but had a view of the backside of the building. I had noticed the room was right across from house keepings. Nothing occurred of the location of the room until maybe after an hour later, I kept hearing the house keeping room being open and closed. Everytime it closed it would slam and it was heard from my room. Aside from the slamming of the door, everytime there was a laundry shoot drop you can hear the metal. It felt as though there was a lightening storm. I only realized it was not when I went outside of the hotel and noticed that it was cloudy, but there was no thunder at all. This basically happened from the hours of 8 am to 5 pm on the 3 nights I had stayed there. Be forewarned the pressure on the shower head is very low. You literally have to stand right under the shower head and just wait for it to drip on you.Having stayed in other hotels within the same vicinity, the rooms may not have been as large as the one at the maxwell hotel, but the staff personal treatment more than made up for the difference."

After reading reviews, I was somewhat hesitant about staying here.However, once I arrived, I was happily surprised. Yes, definitely there was some street noise (I was on the 7th floor), but this hotel is in the heart of downtown. So, if that's your thing, it really can't be beat. And with that information in hand, I just brought some of those soft ear plugs and I was fine to sleep.The room and bathroom were clean and comfy. I didn't notice any spots on the carpet and while there was some wear and tear , it was nothing that I haven't seen in my own home or other hotels. The bathroom was nice and the room seemed plenty spacious. Plus, per some other reivews, since I don't really watch TV, the limited channel scope wasn't really a concern.The front desk and staff were very helpful. And, I got lucky because I found a parking spot a block away. It was Saturday night so parking was free on Sunday. Bonus.Overall, I enjoyed the experience at the Maxwell. I used to live in San Francisco and I'm not really into the whole downtown thing. Yet, having the hotel in such close proximity was pretty fun and I found myself getting up a little earlier just to explore a bit before I had to go to the airport."

When placing the reservation, I was informed that it was under renovation, but I was not troubled by the work being done. In fact, I barely noticed the tell-tale signs of construction. I arrived hours before check-in, and the front desk staff worked to check me into a room that was ready instead of making me wait until later that afternoon. Though given a interior room instead of a street view, I had a beautiful room.The front desk staff -- upon learning it was my first visit and only 48 hours to spend in San Francisco-- went out of their way to recommend the best places to see in the city, how to get there, and what to do. They checked up with me upon each stop back into the hotel and made sure I was okay and enjoying myself.I found it to be a wonderful place, and though a little disappointed to know that it will lose its art deco appeal in the remodel, I would recommend this hotel to everyone -- both now and after the remodel is completed."
"Review_12665","hotel_150","hotel_7664","Aug 5, 2008","Sleepless at the Maxwell - it's NOISY AT NIGHT!! The hotel is located on the corner of Geary and Mason, and right across Mason is Biscuits and Blues, a blues club. The window of our third-floor room was apparently made of Saran Wrap, because from 10 pm to 4 am on Saturday and Sunday nights, we heard it ALL: the music, the drunk hooting and hollering, the horns blaring (?!). Then at around 5, the garbage trucks came to pick up the huge dumpsters full of beer bottles and what-not that were stationed directly below the hotel. It was a horrible experience. I am extremely annoyed because when I called to make the reservation two weeks prior to our check-in date, I asked about the noise level at night due to the renovation. The person dutifully told me that the renovation stopped at 4:30 pm and resumed at 7:30 am so there would be no noise coming from the renovation. They must get a thousand complaints a year about their flimsy windows and the noise from the blues club, though. I think he purposely did not mention the potential for street noise, though he could have suggested that we request a room on the other side of the hotel, perhaps. So, the noise level, plus the really poor customer service, shabby and germy room, terrible mattress, Third-World bathroom...I would not go back to the Maxwell (soon to be the Hotel Frank after the renovation) if they paid me."

The room given (309) needed a total renovation. As out travel agent had assured us that we were booked a renovated room we insisted on changing to another room but both the front desk person and the concierge assured us that there were no renovated rooms in the hotel. We insisted on changing hotel and were promised that the manger would answer us the next day. Room 309 was worn out and especially the bathroom was not clean and was cold becuase the window did not close tightly. The windows offered no sound inulation and we were able to sleep some hours only because the sound of the aircon (needed to be turned on all night long to keep us warm) was strong enough to cover the sounds from the streets. The next day the manager changed us to a completely renovated stylish and confortable room (408), so the front desk manager and concierge had lied about the lack of such rooms."

Whilst the hotel needs redecoration, the service and cleanliness was of a good standard, the room was large and the variety of breakfast served in Max's - attached to the hotel - catered for the healthy and not so healthy. Signs in the lobby clearly stated the hotel was undergoing renovation - I doubt we will be able to afford to stay when it is a fully renovated boutique hotel. I hope they do not hike the prices up, as this is an excellent location."

We always like to try new places and we decided to try the maxwell based on its' proximity to the masonic center, where we were going to a concert. The location is excellent, it is within walking distance from everywhere we wanted to go, like cool bars and restaurants. the staff was very friendly, and our room was small but cute. We've stayed in many older hotels and are not phased by small rooms or hallways. Charming' would be how I would sum up the decor. However, the only reason I'm not giving this a glowing review is because of the noise. I'm not talking about other guests, but the maid service at 8 in the morning! After hearing loud talking and banging around in the next room, I assumed it was guests loudly getting ready to leave. However, when I heard the vacuum cleaner, I realized it was the maids being loud from approximately 7:45-9:30am!!! What the hell?? checkout time is not until noon (another plus in my book) so why wake us up at 8 in the morning??? I was furious and almost considered calling the front desk or banging on the wall but decided against it. I might consider staying there again, but I will be sure to request a room far away from the gathering of the maids in the wee hours of the morning."

We booked this hotel through the vacation package option on Priceline. The only thing we knew was that we wanted to stay in the heart of the city. This hotel is definitely in a fabulous location for the 'big city' feel. You're within walking distance to all of the major department stores (Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Saks) and other great shops. The restaurants around the hotel are excellent and you're a couple blocks away from Market St. which is where most of the bus and trolley lines pick up. The hotel itself is old, they're actually remodeling it this fall, but it has a really cute old Hollywood feel to it. The rooms are tiny, ignore the pictures on the site, you won't get that room. But they are plenty big for people who are there to see the city and not hang out in the room. It does get loud at night as there are a few bars that have late closing times, but turning on the air conditioning unit completely eliminates the crowd noise. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean. This was the perfect hotel for a weekend stay!"

When we were notified that our hotel would be the Maxwell, I immediately came to this site to read the reviews. Honestly, I was a bit concerned because the reviews weren't great.  However, when I saw the room I was relieved and excited! We got upgraded to one of their remodeled suites. They are upgrading and changing their name to Hotel Frank in the fall of 2008. The new room was exactly that, brand new. It even smelled a bit of paint. We had a large, comfortable bed, new carpets, modern-looking lamps and fantastic toiletries in the bathroom. We also had a decent view (street and King George Hotel). The TV was a brand new, flat screen that was much larger that what we have at home.  Yes, the hallways are still narrow, the elevator is painfully slow and the water pressure in the shower is lousy. But, we still enjoyed our stay and would come back when the hotel is fully upgraded."

The hotel were still under renovations for the new look, if it looks now as they promised, it should be looking very modern. As soon as i registered I were informed that i was up-graded to another room. I didn't ask why but i had a bigger room than the one i booked, very spacious with two sofas and a table. I felt like i was at home. The bathroom was very clean and in general everyone at the hotel were always friendly. I always felt welcome. The hotel is very good located, everything is light walk distance, you can also take the BART to the airport, which is very convenient.

Normally one expects old to have a certain charm but not at the Maxwell -- here it's just old. On the positive side, the room was quiet and the highspeed internet was fairly fast so it wasn't a complete waist. They're remodeling the hotel and renaming it (probably to get past all the bad reviews), maybe when that's completed it will be worth another stay but until then, unless you're trying to pinch every penny, do yourself a favor and stay down the street."

Yes, it is an older hotel with small (but very clean and functional bathrooms) and narrow corridors and elevators. However, it is in the heart of San Francisco--close access to the cable cars down to the wharf and all other trendy neighborhoods are within easy walking distance. Staff was not exceptional, but friendly enough and accommodating. They gave me a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite (queen bed and sleep sofa) when I asked if they had a room with two beds, because my automatic reservation was for only one queen bed via priceline.The hotel will soon be undergoing renovations to turn it into a true boutique hotel with flat screen TVs and the like--I say get a great 75-100 dollar rate while you can at this hotel and enjoy the central location and charms of an older building. I think the problem many previous reviewers had with this hotel was their own expectations--not the hotel itself. Of course, there were a few car horn and ambulance noises at night, but it's in the middle of the city! Relax and recognize a good value for what a good value is--that being said I would probably not pay much over 75-95/night for this hotel."

The Aveda bath products were a nice touch, the staff was very helpful and friendly, and room/bathroom surprisingly large for a SF hotel. Loved the extra sink in the bedroom.

When we mentioned that it was also on the toilet he apologized. We got our luggage and went downstairs and asked for a new room. The manager apologized profusely and said that he would make it up to us.

The rooms are nicely decorated and a good size compared to other hotel rooms in San Francisco. The only drawback is that there is no air conditioning system, but not a problem as long as you dont go during a heatwave. Our toilet leaked a bit, but we figured out that all we needed to do was jiggle the handle. the weahter forecast was left on the bed each noght with some chocolates during the turndown service which I considered to be a nice touch. Staff was friendly and courteous, always eager to answer a question or engage in conversation if you had the time. Price was great. Walgreens accross the street was super convenient. We tried finding cheaper parking in the area, but other garages seemed a bit shady, especially when you can smell alcohol on the attendents breath. So we decided to go with the valet parking at the hotel for $35 a day with in and out priveledges. The location was amazing. We were able to walk to the beginning of the cable car line at powell and market st in just a few minutes (5 blocks). I recommend starting there, otherwise you might get passed up at other cable car stops because there is simply no room for you. There is also a subway at that same intersection. Buy a muni pass!. you can use almost every kind of transportation at leisure for unlimited rides. there are other tour busses that charge an arm and a leg to drop you off at all the tourist spots. with a muni pass, all you need is a map of the city to see what lines you need to catch. Super convenient for out trips to fishermans wharf and the ball park. We skipped the transportation for our trips to Yerba Buena Gardens, union square and chinatown.

All three rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and the staff was wonderful. I was concerned because of some of the negative reviews - but was happily surprised with how nice the hotel is. It is very small, but in a great location on Geary Street. The rooms were small, but last year I stayed across the street and paid twice as much for the same size room. There is no air conditioning and we were on the 2nd floor - leaving the windows open for fresh air caused it to be a little noisy at night. We left just the bathroom window open and it was fine. Each room had a ceiling fan - which kept it very comfortable and even a bit too cool one night. The beds were comfortable, but seemed a little smaller than a queen -- if you are used to a large king bed or need a large room, this isn't the place for you. It is an old beautiful hotel with large wooden moldings, large old fashioned brass keys (no digital door locks here). Large dark wood furniture but a modern flat screen TV with pay per view. There was one PC in the lobby for guest use (no charge) - with no charge for printouts - which is unusual. Sometimes there was a line, but it was free - so its hard to complain, right? I had an emergency and needed to be able to send and recieve a fax at 1 a.m. - the front desk staff jumped right on it and helped me out with no complaints - it was great customer service. (No charge for my faxes either.) When we called for ice, a bucket was delivered within minutes at no charge (except for the tip.) There is a safe in the room and the honor bar fridge was only half full so we were able to keep soda and beer in it without a problem without any extra charges. We asked for an iron and one was delivered. There was a hair dryer in one of the drawers. There isn't a closet. But there was an armoir and a lot of drawer space. There is a cable car stop about two blocks away. Decent (not great) pizza two or three stores down. There is a drugstore about 40 feet from the front door, as is a liquor store for snacks, sodas, etc... All in all it was a great value. We paid $107 per night, per room (plus tax) on priceline... in San Fran I would have been comfortable paying up to $160 per night for this hotel and still felt it was a fair price. The best part was that there were no little hidden fees for faxes, pc use, printouts, ice, etc..."

The only closet in the room was an armoire, which had a broken hanging rod. The bellman said he would send someone to fix it. Two days later still not fixed. We had to hang our clothing on the coat hooks. Not very convenient.We did not eat in the hotel, but did have a drink in their small bar, which was pleasant. We did eat at a deli practically next door, which was very good, and a few doors down is a Mexican restaurant to die for.We arrived prior to the rest of our party. We were early for check-in. We had our luggage plus all the luggage for family joining us from England. Staff stored all our luggage eagerly.Two negatives: 1. we overheard the desk giving totally inacurate information to other guests asking directions, and 2. when we asked where we could find a Notary they hadn't a clue what we were talking about."

We booked the hotel on priceline - name your own price and were a little apprehensive after reading some reviews. Must say, our visit was very nice. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was typically small, very clean and comfortable. We were on the 7th floor and had no problem with noise from the street (with our window closed of course). We visit SF every year and have stayed at several more expensive hotels and found really very little difference between them and the Warwick. Would definitely stay there again."

This led me to believe there was a fitness center...they will give you privileges off the hotel site. It is an excellent location for Union Square...easy hop to the cable cars and shopping. It would also be fairly convenient for a convention at the Moscone with a bit of a walk.The entire staff were great and helpful. The breakfast in the restaurant was good. I would give it a 3 star. I was given a room off of Geary on the 4th floor and it was reasonably quiet. The carpet was fairly worn and the remodel is aging but the room was clean and comfortable...a little small."
"Review_12705","hotel_151","hotel_9211","Jul 28, 2008","Just OK..... The place looks better on their website than in person. The Warwick is a relatively small property in a great location on Geary in the heart of the Union Square area. Our room (a junior suite) was much smaller than I had expected (I would guess 200 sq ft) with a tiny bathroom. Our room faced Geary and therefore to get any fresh air into the room it was necessary to open the sliding glass doors overlooking the street. The street noise is considerable, and goes well into the early morning hours - therefore if quiteness is a consideration, avoid the rooms facing Geary. Overall I would say this is a 3 star hotel in my book - the public spaces and hallways were well maintained, but the rooms (at least ours) look a little tired. And the bath was definitely 3 star material. So, great location, just so-so room, OK room rate ($200/night plus $35 for parking) - and noisy."

I am here to tell you that the Warwick is a LOVELY place to stay. We asked for twin beds once the room was booked and were not disappointed. The room  bath was very clean and decorated beautifully. We were on the fifth floor and the only street noise was the occasional ambulance. At night it was very quiet and dark in our room. The furniture included a Chinese armoire that held extra pillows and robes. The bathroom was lined in black marble with golden brass fixtures that portrayed an earlier time. All very elegant. We stayed for 3 nights and the turndown service with chocolate was never missed. Housekeeping came with iron within minutes of request and back again to pick up right when finished. Very attentive. I left my pillow and housekeeper had it waiting at the desk when we came back through town days later. Please don't let the negative comments on travel advisor keep you from booking this hotel. It was a great deal on Priceline and I was very pleased with our stay."

Fold out sofa bed had terrible mattresses. Heat wave forced us to need a fan but fan was in the guest area, not the main room. First room had no window fan so we had to buy one downtown. First room we were assigned had major plumbing leak develop and we asked to be moved to another room. Hotel personnel said she could only put us in a room with one double bed and there were 3 of us! She had no sympathy for our dilemna. Took the maint. dept to get someone else to see we HAD to be moved right away. Also, they advertise free complimentary coffee in lobby in the morning. In fact they only have it from 6am to 7am... hardly a time you want to get up and dressed when on vacation! They also tried to overcharge us for honor bar items.

The room was nice with a comfortable bed and cute antique decor. It was very small though as was the bathroom. The room and bathroom were clean but obviously very old. The front desk staff were all very helpful in directing us to places we should go in town and getting us a shuttle to the airport that was cheaper than a taxi. The hotel is a a great location within walking distance of Union Square shopping, theater district, and a little farther walk to North Beach and Chinatown. It is also very convenient to the transit systems. We ate breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant and it was good but very overpriced for the amount and slow service.

Some of my colleagues that stayed in the rooms at the main bank of elevators, and they said their rooms were like closets and not nice at all. The larger room section was nice. Nice bedding, room, internet service, etc. I got room service twice and thought the food was just OK, one night the food was about an hour late. The hotel has a great location to nearby restaurants, shopping, etc. It's also only 5 blocks from Chinatown.

However, despite some updates, the hotel's age shows. My room was beautiful if you looked up--gleaming chandelier, decorative molding, heavy draperies, tastefully decorated walls. Unfortunately the carpet was shappy, worn, and buckled in places so that I bounced on the way to the bathroom; the room was tiny and I kept bumping into the heavy furniture. There was hardly any drawer space at all ( a night table and two tiny drawers in the closet), and the (nice flat screen) television was placed uncomfortably to the left of the bed. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a reasonable size though drafty. The hallways were large with old, shabby carpeting, and the lovely open marble staircase at the end of the hallway was littered with wrappers. One can defintely appreciate the old glorious past of this hotel but the age can't help but show through."

We commuted from the airport on the city's subway - the BART- and walked the easy 2 blocks up from the Powell Street station. Our approach was nothing short of breathtaking as the merriment on Union Square, with its ice-skating rink and enromous Christmas tree lay before our eyes. I told my husband - that's where we are staying. He said there? in amazement. The hotel with its regal bearing was much more than he expected. In all our 8 days, the only mishap was that we were first given a double bed instead of the queen-size we had booked. Once that was taken care of we enjoyed a comfortable room and a nice sized bathroom with a tub in which to soak one's weary limbs after many days of walking. You can't beat the location. Easy to get to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard Street, Castro, Haight-Ashbury. The hop-on, hop-off shuttles are right outside your door. The restaurant is acclaimed. When in New Orleans, I like a BB, but for San Fran, the Westin St. Francis does you proud!"

The hotel was better than average but nothing spectacular. We were there for 8 nights, with a complimentary upgrade to the 28th floor in the Tower. Glass elevator was great! Views were fantastic. Cleaning was done daily, but not consistently (ie tea/toiletries sometimes replaced). Hotel is very large and very busy, it therefore lacked a more personal touch. Overall though, it was good."

My wife and I were staying on the 11th floor when an obviously crazed man knocked on my door at night and when I opened tried to force his way in. I wrestled him back out the door and as I pushed him out he spit into my face and ran off down the hall. I called security and reported this and about 20 minutes later they showed up and told me they had found him and escorted him from the hotel and if I wanted to I could report to the police but that he was gone.The next day I approached the manager ( I could hardly believe HE had NOT contacted me!!) and he offered that he thought their security was fine but he thought he could comp me for half of one days stay! I had not asked for anything but I was insulted by this and told him he could do whatever he thought appropriate.Given their location on Union Square and the large homeless population that roams this area this hotel CAN NOT GUARANTEE YOUR SECURITY given their existing setup.I am just thankful my wife did not answer the door as I would have been fighting this guy in my room. As it is I will have to be tested over the next months due to the spit.I always loved this hotel but can't stay there any longer."

Normally when I stay in S.F. I stay over at the Hilton on O'Farrell, however considering the special occasion, I decided to upgrade just a bit. BAD DECISION! First let me say that the hotel is AMAZING. The exterior looks like an old 1920's Chicago style hotel. The restaurant, Michael Mina, is a Michelin Star rated restaurant, the bar atmosphere is phenomenal, and the lobby was buzzing with life. Our room was pretty nice. It had a flat panel, heavy blackout drapes and a decent enough bathroom. Unfortunately the walls were PAPER THIN. The both nights we stayed at the hotel, we were startled out of a deep sleep at around 3am by what seemed to be club goers returning from Ruby Skye around the corner. The people yelling and screaming was absolutely ridiculous. It keep me up most of the night. Another MAJOR issue I had with the hotel was their parking situation. I rented a car, because I wanted the flexibility of getting around the city. Unfortunately, this folly cost me an extra $100. The hotel charges $49/night for guest parking which is the same price they charge non-guests. Not to mention everytime we wanted to leave, we were forced to wait over 15 min for our car to be returned from the valet only garage. What made matters even worse was the tip fishing by the valets. I don't mind slipping folks a tip that give great service, however don't overdue the clearing of the throat and the hand gestures.All in all, I will probably never stay at the Westin St. Francis unless it is in a suite in the new tower. However the $49/night will likely keep me at the Hilton from now on which is only 2 blocks west of the St. Francis."

The location is, of course, excellent. I expected the lobby to be larger and a bit more grand, but it is definitely beautiful.I can't say enough about the check-in staff. From my initial check-in, to requests for a late check-out, every person I dealt with was very friendly and helpful - I was never made to feel like a second-class guest since I booked a discounted room online. The concierge was also very helpful in tracking down some touristy information.I stayed in the new addition, and after requesting a room with a view, was very happy getting a nice, large room.

We had stayed in S.F. Le Meridien in the financial district/embarcadero last month and did notice that the St. Francis wasn't as well equipped or as spacious, but the location is what we needed this weekend. My only complaint about the St. Francis is the parking at $49 a night plus taxes is just ridiculous. Even the expensive hotels in S.F. are less. Guests should get a break on parking. I find I am reconsidering SPG hotels for the high charges for internet access parking which add considerably to costs. Many modern hotels have WIFI ."

Mediocre, overpriced, convention hotels that work hard to make that check out bill as high as possible. If you have to stay here, for business, at least you're not paying for it. If you intend to stay here for pleasure, you can do much much better. There are about 50 different room types here which is where the problems start. We experienced four of them...and one didn't even have A BED in it. It was the living room of a suite, in which we were told we would be given rollaway beds. I have never encountered such nonsense in any hotel. They will do anything to make $$, including selling rooms that don't have beds in them. This happened after my friend and I were told we would have to sleep in one double bed -- we're both men and over 6' ft tall because there was nothing else available. First, what hotels these days only have one double bed in them and claim to have nothing else on reserve to solve these problems? And the best part: they really don't care. Just bring in the $$. We refused the rollaway beds and after, much arguing, ended up with a Murphy Bed, of all things. Again, beyond explanation. From the aged furnishings to plumbing problems, exorbitant food costs and poor ventilation system, 10 minute elevator waits and more, I hope Starwood sells this cash cow and then a committed hotel company with vision and passion can do something great with it."

Once in the car park we were 鈥渨elcomed鈥?by the valet guys.When checking in to the hotel the guy on the front desk was very rude and more or less threw our passports and credit card back at us.Once in our room it took 45 minutes for our bags to arrive. This is when we realised we had made a horrible mistake in coming to this hotel! The bell boy was totally unpleasant and threw our bags on the floor taking no care with them at all. We believe in tipping for good service, therefore due to the bad service we were not tipping this guy! When he realised he was not getting a tip he refused to leave our room! When he eventually did leave he slammed the door shut! Within the next 5 minutes we received 2 prank phone calls to our room.We decided that after such a long trip we would order room service, the food was delivered promptly, but was not worth the money at all. When the food was delivered to our room I lifted the pen to sign the bill and the waiter who delivered the food turned to my husband and asked him if I was 鈥渁llowed鈥?to sign for the food! When we looked at the bill we were quite shocked at how much of a tip the hotel had allocated their staff!The following morning we needed to print our tickets to Alcatraz, my husband spent an hour trying to arrange this with the concierge (we had our lap top with us it should have been a 5 minute thing). We were told that they could not let us wait at reception for our 1 sheet of paper it would be delivered to our room  would cost $3!!! What a rip off!We found that any time we wanted to get out car from the very expensive car park we had to wait 20 minutes!The attitude of all the staff we met was awful, they made us feel totally unwelcome. An awful experience all round! We have stayed in Westin hotels many times in lots of different locations and this one was such a let down.

We were expecting a big price tag for overnight parking having parked rental cars in the city in the past, but come on. We opted for a room in the new tower because friends who鈥檝e stayed in the older portion of the hotel said the rooms in that building were like cracker boxes. However our room was on the larger side, decently appointed and had an amazing view of the bay and city skyline. We never visit San Francisco to spend the weekend in our room, but the overall impression of the room was standard and cookie cutter. In my opinion that is sorta a Westin for you, but they are usually very clean (which this was) and have nice dining and guest lounges, which the St. Francis did as well. The real bonus of the St. Francis is the convenient location. Since it is right on Union Square, terrific shopping is literally right out your front door and you can hop a cab or cable car to hit other big tourist spots in the city. Point is if you are in the city to play tourist, then the St. Francis is a great home base. If I were to get another deal like the one we got for this stay, I would consider the St. Francis again; otherwise, I'd probably take my money elsewhere and find a more boutique/unique experience."
"Review_12739","hotel_152","hotel_1677","Oct 2, 2008","Great Location and Hotel This is a classic hotel in the heart of S.F. downtown shopping district. We stayed in the newer tower which I would recommend. It is well appointed and has newer furnishings than the older tower(stayed in that one last year). I love the heavenly bedding and shower...definitely adds to the value. There is a great bar and nightlife in the main lobby. Prices are high but that's the city. I would recommend parking yourself at the Union Square garage right in front of the St. Francis. It's only $31 a day rather than the hotels cost of $50 a day. I would also recommend using the metro to get around to other parts of the city...very inexpensive....$1.50So overall a great experience. Make sure you go to a Giants baseball game too....amazing stadium with a view :)"

The hotel is old (in the historic sense) and charming. Our room was small, but just what we expected from a hotel of this vintage. (It reminded us of the rooms in the good old New York hotels.) Check-in was pleasant, and we were suprised that we had a choice of rooms even though we arrived two or three hours earlier then their announced check-in time. Housekeeping was very good, and the room was clean and comfortable. And the concierge had excellent restaurant recommendations for lunch and dinner. Perhaps the best feature of the hotel is the location--right on Union Square.A couple of suggestions. Ask for a room away from the front of the hotel. You won't get a view, but you also won't be kept awake by city noise. And, if you need a cab for dinner, be prepared to wait 15 or 20 minutes in a queue in front of the hotel. Everyone else will likely need a cab when you do."

The first was lovely - as an SPG member I was upgraded to a nice room in the new tower. The room was spacious and quiet. The second experience was less pleasant. My flight was delayed from the east coast and I arrived in SF after midnight which is 3 am my time. I just wanted to get to sleep. I was given a room in the older tower and the hallways had a very musty odor (not a big deal). When I got to the room, I opened the door and tripped on the bed. This was without a doubt the smallest room I have every seen. I live in a studio in Manhattan so I am used to small spaces but this was ridiculous. I couldn't even move around in the room and had to put my suitcase in the closet to open and unpack because there was no room to put it on the floor and open it without me having to jump over it get around. When my colleague came by the next morning to pick me up for breakfast he was stunned by how small the room was and exclaimed This is the tiniest, most horrible room ever!Believe it or not, the tiny room wasn't the worst part. Because it was 3:00am my time I was exhausted and couldn't wait to get some sleep. In the middle of the night I was woken up by what I thought was thunder but later came to realize was the sound of my next door neighbor flushing the toilet. Every time some one in a neighboring room went to the bathroom, turned on the sink or took a shower a booming noise went through my room so there is a plumbing issue there. I am going to San Francisco this weekend for business again and I am not staying in this hotel even though it is the most convenient to Union Square which is where I need to be. I just am not willing to take my chances and end up in a shoebox that makes my little apartment seem like a palace."

All staff we met were very helpful.Our Room was on the 20th floor and a decent size. It was in the newer Tower Wing. As with all Westin hotels rooms it had very comfortable beds. Bathrooms are in marble and were maybe the nicest part of the room. The room was cleaned extremely well. Only real fault was a reading light that was completely broken and although we mentioned it to the cleaning lady after 5 nights it still was broken and looked likely to fall at any moment.The floor was a Starwood Preferred Floor but not sure what was different. You still have to pay $10 a day for Internet!Have stayed at the Hyatt on Union Square and I found this hotel quieter. The view was decent though just a few floors higher it would have been much nicer. The corridors could definitely do with redecorating and look from a different decade. Seems a shame as the rooms themselves seem more up to date."

The room was not ready at one pm so we went out the front door and used our 3 day transit pass to hop on the cablecar down to the Wharf for lunch. When we returned the room (at a special conference rate) was still not ready and the front desk was very busy. Yet the receptionist found us a half studio way up the tower at the same rate. We took the glass elevator up and stepped into a room with windows on 2 sides overlooking the City (though no Westin bed). We flew back down and said yes we love it. When I thanked the manager at the desk area she was glad we were happy and sent us a wine basket to welcome us. So for a big busy conference hotel we were much impressed."
"Review_12747","hotel_152","hotel_7129","Sep 13, 2008","My go-to hotel in San Francisco As a business traveler, the St. Francis is in a perfect location right in the heart of downtown San Francisco. The front desk staff was very helpful to me on this particular trip, as I had left an item in my room upon check-out, returned five minutes later, and they quickly helped me retrieve the item. I love the size of the rooms, along with the big-screen television (HD for more channels would certainly be a plus). For a high rise hotel, I very rarely had to wait more than 15-30 seconds for an elevator - and the hotel was nearly at capacity.Only a couple things prevent this hotel from being five stars in my book - first, the closet doors in my room had obvious nicks in them that almost seemed calling out to be fixed. Also, the toilet fixtures don't seem to match the luxury image of the hotel. On the plus side, the Heavenly Bed is great, along with the views from the high-story rooms.Whenever I'm in San Francisco, I would stay here, especially since the price is typically the lowest of the Starwood properties in downtown San Francisco."
"Review_12748","hotel_152","hotel_9706","Sep 10, 2008","Beautiful hotel, but some problems with the cleaning service I recently stayed at the Westin St. Francis for six nights using my Starwood points. The location of this hotel is great--easy walk to Nob Hill, Chinatown and of course Union Square. I was very pleased with the room, spacious and very clean and of course, the infamous Westin Heavenly Beds. The only thing that was troubling during the stay were some items were taken from my room. I noticed one thing immediately and reported it, and was reimbursed for the item, but after the cleaning service was in the room, it magically appeared again. On the way home I remember a gift that I had purchased for my daughter was also missing. I contacted the hotel twice and got absolutely no response about this. Luckily the items were not of significant value, but I wonder if anyone else who stayed at this hotel had a similar experience. I am surprised that a hotel of this caliber would not respond to even apologize about this. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest and have never had an experience such as this in one of their hotels."
"Review_12749","hotel_152","hotel_8745","Sep 8, 2008","Great location, shabby hotel The location in Union Square is perfect--central, happening, terrific shops at your doorstep (for example Victoria's Secret off the main lobby and Chanel, Macy's and Max Mara a block away), but the rooms--and I stayed in three different rooms over a 5-day stay--were all shabby and each had problems (leaking pipes, non-working phones, bathtub and shower fixture handles that fell off when you turned the water on, tiles coming off the walls, etc.). I also found the lack of a standard hotel coffee shop a shortfall; sometimes you just want a salad or sandwich in the relative calm of your own hotel. It was fun staying there because of the immediate vicinity with its cool jazz bands on warm evenings and little wine bars and coffee shops around the corner, but next time I'll opt for the Ritz or one of the newer hotels."

Its a very dark hotel with a poor bar area - more like a Waiting lounge than a bar and not at all what i like - the bar in nice hotels makes a hotel this did not! there is nothing better than returning from your day or evening and having a lovely drink and people watching- this was disappointing.

"Review_12755","hotel_152","hotel_9381","Aug 21, 2008","Loved the location I've always wanted to stay at the St. Francis due to the location right on Union Square as well as the history of the hotel. Our room 839 was in the historic part of the St. Francis and was a corner room looking north on Post. The room was lovely and very,very large (two double beds). I felt like I was staying in a lovely victorian mansion guest room with all the charm that goes with it. The beds were very comfortable and our room was very quiet. I feel that honor bars are something all hotels should do away with (who uses them?) and let guest keep water in the small refrigs. Who can't walk a block to the local market or Walgreens in this case and load up on snacks? The Food was good at the Oak Room the one night we ate in. For a great dinner experience at a reasonable San Fran price, walk 2 1/2 blks to John's Grill (63 Ellis St). Great Ceasar Salad and my sister loved the Halibut, the other diners' steaks looked great. This was my first time to visit San Francisco in August, I would recommend to avoid summer if possible, too crowded. Be sure to bring a coat and gloves, especially in the summer.Highlight of the trip...Mr. Toads tours. (www.mrtoadstours.com), worth every penny...try to get Kathy if possible. I have visited many times and even lived in the bay area 30+ yrs ago but I learned much and went places I didn't know about.Hoakiest...Blue and Gold cruise Escape from the Rock. If you are really interested in Alcatraz, take the offical cruise from Pier 33 ([--])"
"Review_12756","hotel_152","hotel_9073","Aug 20, 2008","Great stay at historic hotel! We stayed at the Westin in August of 08. We were given a room on the 10th floor of the old building at the front of the hotel (facing Union Square). We had a partial view of Saks, Tiffany and Co. and other stores on the sqaure. Check in was very quick and the bellboy who took our bags up was extremely informative and friendly. He turned the thermostat down for us, showed us how to use the menu guide on the tv, explained where everything in the hotel was and the how to get to the cable cars, etc. Concierge very knowledgeable. We passed by a wine bar a few blocks from the square on our first night, and when I couldn't remember where it was (or its name) the next day, he knew exactly where it was and whipped out a map with a marked route to get us there. The hotel staff in general are very helpful and polite. We were lucky in that we were given what I guess is a larger room with king bed. Room was probably 20X12. The room was painted in soothing shades of creams/tans with white woodwork, coved ceiling and lots of crown moulding, a crystal chandelier, and large flat screen tv. Bathroom was small, but in great condition and well appointed. My husband's a triathlete, so we visit the gym in every hotel we stay in. He was very impressed with the gym at the Westin. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for location and historical charm. It seems other reviews complain about things like room size, small bathrooms, outdated decor, etc. This hotel is for those that enjoy the charm of historical buildings. If you're looking for a huge master suite type bathroom and olympic sized pool, go somewhere else. Only downside was paying $14 a day for internet and $16 a day for the gym. However, I scored a $189 a night rate through expedia, so didn't feel like we were overcharged on our stay. Great experience at the Westin!"
"Review_12757","hotel_152","hotel_1721","Aug 19, 2008","Outdated  My brother's family  my family stayed in 2 rooms in the Tower building for 7 nights. We do a lot of traveling and have stayed in many different hotels (everything from a Comfort Inn to the Mandarin Orientals  the Penninsulas), and have never been as disappointed as we were with this hotel. We are definitely NOT picky people and ALWAYS try to give the benefit of the doubt to the hotel and their staff. I have NEVER given a hotel a one star rating  that itself tells a lot on my part. In addition, I am a Starwood Preferred Guest and our last three hotel stays have been in Westins. We arrived at the hotel (our time 2 am-SF 11 pm) after traveling for 5 hours with a 9 mo. old  another child. When we arrived at the hotel, not a single person asked if they could assist us with our luggage. They saw us, but didn't even bother to open the door as we were struggling with the baby and the luggage. After check-in (which went ok), we asked 3 different people (including front desk) for luggage assistance to our room. 20 minutes after checking in and STILL standing in the lobby, WE had to hunt the bellman down. We asked kindly if he could bring the luggage as quickly as possible, as we were extremely exhausted (esp. with the baby). He said it would be 10-15 minutes for him to deliver the luggage (which we had no problem with). After 30 minutes of waiting in our room, we called the front desk and complained that our luggage was not with us yet. The bellman came after another 10 minutes and proceeded to THROW our luggage into our room and tell us that we need to be more patient (this, after waiting 40 minutes for him to deliver the luggage)! He not only threw our luggage into the room, berated us for not being patient, but also slammed the door on the way out! By this time, it is after our 3 am! My sister-in-law called the manager and complained and they did give us breakfast the next morning, but it had already left a sour taste in our mouths. However, we still we willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the rest of the hotel  their staff.We found the hotel staff and the hotel itself to be very unaccomodating (with the exception of the Concierge-they were very helpful), cold, and unwelcoming. We did not feel any comfort coming back to the hotel at the end of the day and really didn't feel like we could enjoy the lobby or anything. Although it was spacious, the rooms itself were cold, outdated, very worn out, dim, and did not make you feel comfortable (and these were the tower rooms-can't imagine what the old part felt like). The environment made us not want to spend any time in the hotel or the room. On top of that, room service was not only VERY expensive, but there were absolutely no choices on the menu. Our first night there, our daughter was starving. Since we don't eat meat, there was NOTHING on the menu that we could order. Even the kids menu was closed-not even pizza! So she had to settle for cookies  milk! After that, we went out  got food (there are numerous choices right outside the hotel).This is a HORRIBLE, unwelcoming,  very old hotel and it needs some serious updating in every aspect of the hotel. Having paid approx. $300 a night (a piece for each of our rooms) for this hotel, we felt we had completely  utterly wasted our money. For us, the hotel experience is half the vacation, and this was a complete waste. This hotel DOES NOT live up to the Westin name. Don't stay here. My brother stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero hotel and he said that was a palace compared to this dump. Better off going someplace else."

We had breathtaking views of the city and an exciting elevator ride everytime. You can't beat the location as it's close to all public transportation and the Powell Street cable car turnaround. You are paying for the location and the view. The rooms had been updated at some point, but really, they were just ok and nothing special. There were stains on the carpet. The Heavenly bed was not that comfortable. The room felt sparse.There is a big sign on the mini fridge - $25 cleaning fee for removing items to store personal items. So, like all the reviewers have stated before - don't even peek at the minifridge unless you want to buy something. They might have a sensor that charges you for looking! btw, there's a Walgreens close by where you can pick up cold drinks and snacks.Overall it was an adequate hotel stay, but that's all I can really say.

The touristy part of San Francisco runs from Fisherman's Wharf where you can jump on a boat to visit Alcatraz all the way down to Union Square where all the major shops are. The Westin is based right on Union Square and is a short walk from the tram terminus, the shops, great restaurants, Chinatown etcThe staff were excellent and very friendly with the kids. Check in was swift and this is where the will you/won't you like this hotel lottery kicks in...the rooms. Some are great (ours was) and some are smaller then your bedroom closet. E mail ahead and get confirmation of a good spacious room on a higher floor (22nd floor and higher for the views) in the Tower block and you'll agree with all the positive reviews. Get given a broom cupboard and you'll agree with the negative reviews.Some tips for SF:1/ Book way in advance for the Alcatraz tours as they sell out quickly. Buy through alcatrazcruises as they run the boats and are the cheapest. Night time tour is good2/ Take a jumper/jacket even in the middle of Summer. It's cold out there in the bay3/ Ride the trams. $5.00 for a single journey. Take the old trams along the F route from Fishermans Wharf to see the non touristy parts of San Francisco 4/ If there's only 2 of you then wait at the traffic lights for the trams to stop and the driver may let you onboard. Queues at the start points can be lengthy5/ Don't get sucked in and eat at the breakfast restaurants recommended in the guidebooks. You will queue for an hour for the same breakfast as you can get at any place"

A year after our engagement in SF, my fiance and I decided to return to SF...I guess you can say we left our hearts in SF.We decided to stay at the landmark Westin St. Francis and thank goodness we did. We had the Golden Gate Suite (I'm pretty sure that was the name) on the 31st Floor and had the most phenomenal views of SF...breath-taking in fact. The room had a marble entry with a mini-kitchen, a luxurious dining table, beautifully upholstered couches and their Heavenly bed in the bedroom. The suite came equipped with a Bose CD player. Although the prior year we stayed in a Ritz Carlton suite (and that was gorgeous), we preferred the decor of the Westin suite better. That and the views are beyond words.The hotel, itself, gets very crowded. Many tourists love coming into the hotel to ride the glass elevators to the top to get a view of SF. But overall, we knew what to expect with a bustling hotel, in the heart of SF. The hotel was very kind when we mentioned we were celebrating our engagement (a year later) and surprised us with chocolate covered strawberries. Needless to say, this was NOT our last time, nor will it be our last time in SF."

My stay at the Westin St.Francis was one of very mixed reviews. I will start with the good. The staff was incredible. Very polite, courteous and extremely professional. That goes from the front desk people all the way through to the cleaning and maintenance group. That was the good. Now the part you probably do not want to read about. The hotel nickel and dimed all of its guests. Pay to use the internet, a fee being accessed to your room every time you open the fridge and I could not believe it was $12.00 each time to use the Gym or $30 for the week. If that is what you can call it. If you want to do cardio on a treadmill or stepper they had it covered. Anyone wanting to do weight training was in trouble. The facility had 2 machines and some hand weights. Big problem if 2 people wanted to lift weights at the same time. Because they couldn't! There is not ample room to do so. As for the steam room that is advertised. What can I say. It doesn't work. There isn't steam in the steam room. It is sort of like a wet sauna. I never felt hot enough to work up the good sweat to clean out my pores. Enough about that. My biggest problem came with my room. It took 2 requests for someone to come up and clear my bath tub which drained very slowly. The bed was not very comfortable despite the cloud or heaven tag that was thrown on it and the noise that transferred from room-to-room and from the hallway was unbelievable. Half of my problem trying to sleep was from transferred noise that came from doors closing, toilets being flushed or showers being taken, conversations of other guest late at night and that damned ice machine. It was as though I was sleeping in a tent not a expensive posh hotel room. I felt there was very little privacy. If I can hear them I am sure they could hear me and my wife. Talk about killing romance. Finally and probably the biggest offense was the cleanliness of my room. Especially the bathroom. Let me explain. They have an infomercial running that states Smell that! That is clean air you are breathing. The Hotel takes great pride in the cleanliness of the air provided to its guests. My room was 723. The dust and hair hanging out of the vent in my bathroom horrified me and my wife. After 2 days at the hotel, I started to cough at night and sneeze. I thought I was getting a cold. Strangely it only happened at night. Then on Friday night I was taking a late night steamy hot shower to try to clear my lungs. I looked up at the vent above my shower. Right then I knew where all my problems were coming from. I also looked at the bathroom floor at the mold and dirt in the grout lines of our tiled floor. The room was clean looking at a quick glance but certainly not sanitized. Needless to say I did sleep at all that last night. Thinking about it made my condition worse."

It's on Powell and Geary and close to almost everything you need in the city.Cons:- Rooms need some serious updating. The furniture is still from the 80s. I got upgraded to a deluxe room so the standard room was probably worse off. The only saving grace was that the room was spacious- Charged $12/day for use of fitness center. I expect this at perhaps a luxury resort but not at a Westin that is so much in need of renovation- Cleaning services could be more thorough/offer turndown service, etc."

I picked the Westin St. Francis because it looked rather nice and besides, with a Westin, how could you go wrong --- Not. We checked around 8:30 pm and Check in was the high point of our stay, it was swift and efficient. We were on the 29th Floor of the new tower and thought we would be spared the noise from a make shift music festival on the corner of Geary and Powell. No such luck. I had requested a refrigerator before we arrived because I knew we'd be checking in late, and was told by the Express Service Manager, that she had taken the liberty to arrange that service for me. I asked the front desk and was told that it would be there. It wasn't, and arrived only after I called 4 times. Finally at 11:30 pm, when I said, that I would like to go to sleep, they brought my refrigerator. They tell you that the cable car stops right at the door, what they don't tell you is that you won't get on the cable car unless you walk down to the turnaround on Market St, and only after you walk down Powell St., where every panhandler of San Francisco waits for a handout.We were supposed to have a city and bay view room. This was not the case, saw the city, but not the bay. Housekeeping in the hotel was okay, but there were days that my husband had to find the area where they threw out (or were supposed to) throw out the trash because ours wasn't picked up. I was taking a shower and went to turn the water off and the handle came off in my hand. This is hardly what you consider you'll be doing after paying $500 a night for this hotel.Twice the concierge gave me incorrect information on where to wait for a tour and then for the return shuttle to the airport.If you stay here, check your bill before you leave. I was there for 4 nights, and charged for 6 days of internet service (double charged on two of the days) as though they didn't make enough revenue on my room.Would I stay here again-- not in a million years and the management has heard from me via snail mail. This hotel does not live up to the standards of a Westin. They need to send the management to the Westin Moana Surfrider in Honolulu to learn the fine art of being a Westin property."

Front desk offered to upgrade me to a junior suite but when I asked, she recommended I keep my original room because it was on the 29th floor corner in the New Tower, which meant I had 2 great panoramic views. The elevator ride up was a treat as it is attached to the outside facing Union Square. Some of the fellow riders seemed to find it a bit scary, but the view is magnificent once you get to the upper floors. The room was clean and spacious (by metropolitan hotel standards) with modern furniture and a 37 inch LCD tv. Their cable service offered HBO and a few other channels in HD. The room also included the Heavenly Bath and Heavenly pillowsets that are a staple of the Westin brand.Location was great as it's right in Union Square with plenty of shopping and lots of action right at our doorstep. During our stay, Union Sq hosted an art festival, the Indonesian culture festival, not to mention a Gay Rights march! For you sports fans, I saw Mark Grace and Kimbo Slice in the lobby and the Diamondbacks must have been staying there beause I frequently saw autograph seekers waiting outside. Both Chinatown and the SFMOMA are within 5-10 minute walking distance and plenty of restuarant options nearby. I found the concierge very helpful in guiding us with public transportation and recommending restaurants. My main beefs would be the cost of parking ($49/night) and internet service ($15/day). I suppose that's not outrageous for a city hotel but still tough to swallow nonetheless. Also, I didn't use the gym but they charge $12/day, free for SPG Platinum members. Overall, a nice upscale hotel with a lot of history. Definitely recommended."

The room I stayed in was attractive and clean. It was not large, but it was not tiny, either. It might have felt cramped for more than two people, although I stayed by myself because I was traveling for business. The bathroom was fairly small but well-lit and clean, and the shower water pressure was good. The hotel is historic and showing its age a little bit, but it is still beautiful. I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again.The location is fantastic. It is right on Union Square, and there is plenty of vehicular and pedestrian traffic on Powell Street night and day. BART and MUNI lines are very close by, only about three blocks."

It is busy, busy, and set in the middle of a busy district-- but to see the City, the location is good. The room was quiet and adequate. The service was hit and miss. We had to request a bathrobe and that the burned out lightbulbs be replaced. The minibar continued to lock itself and we had to ask repeatedly for assistance (they can only unlock it technologically-- there is no key). The elevators are overused and clearly need some maintenance-- they worked sporadically. We were charged extra for internet connection and water, as well as $45/day for parking!! Overall fine, but the hotel is very old and needs some maintenance."
"Review_12769","hotel_152","hotel_1411","Jul 23, 2008","Terribly needs renovations ! It is really a shame that this hotel carries the Westin name. While I understand that it has a historic block/building - I really don't expect that histroic means complete run down. The size of the room is ok - actually quite big (especially when it does not have much furnitures apart from a king-bed and small table). But this is about the only positive thing I could say. The photos on their website (particular about the historic block) are complete joke. We have paid over $230 for a room and felt completely ripped off. VERY DISAPPOINTED ! My advice is to avoid until it has completely renovated all the rooms. It just ruined its name and it should stop renting out those terrible rooms !"
"Review_12770","hotel_152","hotel_7342","Jul 21, 2008","Nice staff, tiny room The Westin is huge with different elevator banks and hallways - and the staff is wonderful and very friendly. The building is beautiful both outside and inside - there's a cafe and some shops available too. Location is central and on a pretty busy street with all the shops of Union Square right outside. The trolley is right across the street.My only complaint is the room. It was TINY. I live in NYC so I'm used to small rooms, but this is one small room! The coffee maker was in the closet. The entrance door opens right into the bed. You can't have the bathroom door open and the closet door open at the same time. The walls and doors were super thin. I heard everything next door - the TV, conversation, yawning - I heard everything in the hall too. The view was a brick wall. I think it was just my luck with the room assignment and thank goodness I traveled alone on this trip because this room was really meant for one person. I'd go back but I'd definitely make sure that I had a different room."

The room was large and the accommodations were nice. The bathroom is the one spot I encountered some problems. The space was very crowded considering the size of the bedroom. The sink must have measured eight inches by four inches. I can only imagine a woman trying to use that bathroom with all her makeup鈥?not good. However, the room was quiet and comfortable. I would not mind staying here again; I just would not go out of my way to stay at this hotel once more. I rated it above average as it has many positive attributes."
"Review_12772","hotel_152","hotel_4880","Jul 20, 2008","Bed was heavinly but room and service was hellish... Let me first say that because I have traveled all over the world and stayed in every conceivable accommodation from hostels and pensiones to some of the best hotels that the world has to offer, that I feel well qualified to offer my thoughts on this hotel. I will also state that I tend to take many negative hotel and travel reviews with a grain of salt as I believe that my expectations aren't unreasonable. Upon arriving, I checked in and politely asked if it was possible to receive a complimentary room upgrade to a view room in their tower building. My request was met with a question that I have never been asked before when requesting an upgrade which was what is your reason for requesting an upgrade? I stated that I just always ask. I was told that the hotel was at 100% occupancy (which I'm skeptical about since this is downtown S.F. on a weekend, the economy is in the tank and the high number of rooms and hotels in S.F.). After checking with the manager, the person at reception said that it couldn鈥檛 be done since the hotel was full. Now, I know many of you are probably thinking, this guy didn鈥檛 get an upgrade and is upset so thus, is writing a negative review. I have no problems with not getting the upgrade; I just found that being asked why I was asking (as though if I had the right answer it would have been possible) seemed rather odd.The reception person noted that I have a child and attempted to locate one of the gifts that the St. Francis gives to children travelers. He was unable to locate said gift (after he offered it...it was unsolicited) and stated that housekeeping would find one and deliver it to the room. It never arrived. I could live with this in addition to not getting the upgrade but it gets better...Arrive at the room which is very, make that incredibly small. I had read the other reviews on here indicating this and what others say is true. Now, I totally get that this is S.F. and that many of the rooms are more European style making them much smaller than the average American room but had I not booked this room through Priceline (as I always do when booking rooms in S.F. or L.A.) and paid less than half of the Westin's advertised rate, I would have been VERY disappointed. Not only was the room tiny, it did not appear to be well maintained or very clean. I should note that I find it interesting that the person at reception stated that the hotel was at 100% occupancy yet I was able to get a room through Priceline (which works off of excess inventory) just days before our trip.Another issue that we had was that my wife phoned down to the front desk and requested a crib for our daughter. She was told that one would be sent up right away. After waiting for well over an hour and due to the fact that we were exhausted, we gave up and the three of us slept in the one bed. Overall, I just cannot give this property very high marks especially after having stayed at others within close range of the St. Francis such as the Nikko, Parc 55 and Grand Hyatt all of which in my opinion are better hotels. I鈥檝e stayed in the regular rooms at all of the properties and there is just no comparison in size and quality over the St. Francis.I must admit that I feel that for the first time that using Priceline perhaps was held against me however I certainly don鈥檛 feel bad or apologize for being a 鈥渟avvy鈥?traveler and one who likes get a good deal. One obvious question is that why would the check in person even check with the manager if we could upgrade if it weren鈥檛 possible? He seemed to waiver between 100% capacity and a possibility. That just seemed odd to me. I suppose my answer to the check in persons question would be that I travel a great deal and because of this, there is a very good chance that I/we may be back (although not to the St. Francis). In fact, S.F. is a city that we do frequent. I am also a person who because of the amount of traveling I do, is often asked for hotel recommendations. Lastly, I must admit that for the first time since using it, I feel as though booking through Priceline may have been held against me. I have no trouble paying full price for a room but as I鈥檝e said, I like to get a good deal when I know they鈥檙e out there. In fact, I have three rooms reserved at the Wynn in Las Vegas next week. I look forward to being at the Wynn and at a property that unlike the St. Francis truly sets the bar very high."
"Review_12773","hotel_152","hotel_6145","Jul 15, 2008","Great location As you've previously read this is a great location with the trolley running right by the hotel, taxis lined up and ready for you, Union Square right in front.We had a nice corner room on the 25th floor with 180 degree views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Union Square and the Bay. The glass elevators are wonderful providing great views on the way to and from your room and they are speedy. We had a great stay in San Francisco and enjoyed this location but there were few things not up to par.The Oak Room was just ok - actually the food was pretty good but the service was substandard. Most of the staff was cordial, friendly, and wanted to help in any way they could. However the expectation of a tip was obvious every time something was done for you.Our biggest complaint would be about the mini bar (refreshment center in the room). Each item you consume is charged a 20% service charge (tip) plus sales tax - this adds up! There was also a discrepancy in the amount we were charged and the amount of things we agreed that we consumed. Beware!"
"Review_12774","hotel_152","hotel_4416","Jul 13, 2008","Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay I brought my family along for a 2-night business stay at the Westin St. Francis. We really enjoyed our time there. For me, a BIG part was my love of the historic architecture and knowing some of the history of the hotel before going there--it's one of the oldest buildings in San Francisco. The building really is a beauty and we stayed in the old part of the hotel. I have read that there is a bit of luck of the draw with these rooms. Our rooms had 2 double beds and was a nice size, although it had NO view to speak of (However the hotel is configured, our room looked across to someone else's room window--and they were getting changed right in front of it!). The room had a big closet, but no bureau for clothing, which I found odd. But our marble bath was immense (I've read other reviews where people got tiny baths.) The room was clean and updated, and I loved the baby blue paint and crown molding and crystal chandelier--the old-time elegance of the decoration was big for me. I always find the Westin bed comfortable. The cable car stops directly outside the hotel, which was convenient for my husband and 2 little kids who wanted to do typical sightseeing activities (ride the cable car, Fisherman's Wharf to Alcatraz, etc.) while I worked. I think the main floor layout is a little strange. Coming in off the front entrance, the common area there is a bit dark and dreary. The restaurant Michael Mina is there and construction is underway I think on a bar facing the restaurant. But the actual reception area is away from the street toward the back. The real lobby/reception area is bright and cheerful. I thought the staff was uniformly friendly and efficient (front desk, concierge, bar and breakfast restaurant). Overall, I just had 2 beefs about the hotel. First, our room adjoined another room and the walls were paper thin. The person's television on the other side was clear as a bell. But fortunately, they turned in early, so it didn't become a problem I had to deal with. This could be a big problem if you get unlucky in your neighbors. Second, I picked up a can of cookies from the minibar to read the ingredients and was charged instantly, though I put it back. i guess this is standard practice, but I find it annoying. They gave me no hassle about taking it off my bill on checkout, however. We did bring a rental car (and my husband took the kids to beautiful Muir Woods), but parking is a FORTUNE at the hotel garage--$50/night. You definitely don't need a car if you're not venturing outside the city. Otherwise, I got a corporate rate of about $220/night for the room. I think that's a great rate for this hotel, and not typical. If you are into soaking up the historic ambience, then I think you'll enjoy. If you decide not to stay, pop in and ride the glass Tower elevator to the top for a fun ride and good view."
"Review_12775","hotel_152","hotel_8389","Jul 9, 2008","Nice Hotel but? We have just returned from a Canada and Alaska trip and stayed 3 nights in the Westin St. Francis Hotel. We stayed in the historical section, and had what was described as a run of the house room. The room itself was fine but our room was right next to the elevator shaft and we could hear the elevators going up and down all night long. If you do decide to stay at this hotel make sure you do not get a room that backs onto the elevator shaft, apart from this we could not fault the hotel at all, the staff were very friendly and efficient. I would definately recommend this hotel as it is central to everything e.g. shopping, the cable car stops right in front and takes you down to Fisherman's Wharf and all the attractions in that area. There are some great places to eat in the area around the hotel and we felt safe walking around at night."

"Review_12778","hotel_152","hotel_8227","Jul 5, 2008","Who's opinion is right? This hotel tends to get mixed reviews and I guess people ask the question, who's opinion is right? I think the answers is that they are probably all correct depending on how much you pay and what room you are assigned.I'd like to start by saying that if it's a good location you want then you couldn't do better. Not only is this Hotel on Union Square it is in fact the finest building on Union Square so you feel you really are staying in a true piece of American history. The lobby area is very traditional and has a real feel of turn of the century style without being dated (If you're looking for straight lines and minimalism or Ikea styling then look elsewhere).The luck of the draw comes with your room assignment as far as I can see. Myself and a friend both got rooms at the Westin St Francis, I upgraded to a traditional tower room and he got a standard in the old building. The room in the old building was tired and in real need of upgrading while I found the tower to be very comfortable and spacious. I think you'd have a right to feel let down if you paid full price and ended up with a standard room in the old building with a view of a wall.With regard to descriptions like 'heavenly bed' I must say I find these descriptions to generally be over the top but I must say that it is one very comfortable bed so I wouldn't argue too much about that. The room also had a nice large lcd tv with high definition channels and very good air conditioning which unlike many other hotels keeps your room at the same temperature throughout the day rather than you returning to the room and waiting an age for it to become comfortable again. The staff were also excellent and could not be faulted so I find it a little disappointing that whenever anyone has anything negative to say about the hotel on this web site the hotel representative seems to cut and paste a paragraph out of a hotel brochure as a reply rather than address the issue. I found the staff on the ground to be far more attentive than this.I would certainly recommend this hotel if you get the right room at the right price which I did so I'd like to thank the Westin st Francis for a very good stay."
"Review_12779","hotel_152","hotel_3523","Jul 1, 2008","Reasonably nice, but not entirely up to Westin standards It's hard to be too critical given that our room rate (pay for two nights, get one free) worked out to about $105 a night for one of the small rooms in the older section of the hotel, but when they said without a view, they meant it. The window looked at a brick wall and the lack of morning light was really disconcerting. Internet access was a whopping $15/day, which seemed unreasonable given I can get free wireless at podunk hotels in Eastern WA (we travel for softball). The room decor was charming (blue walls, lots of crown moulding) and the huge LCD television actually had HD channels available, which was great. The bathrooms in the old section (built around the turn of the century, so it's understandable) were TINY - my husband and I couldn't brush our teeth at the same time. The location is excellent, just a few blocks from a BART station (only $5.35 from the airport, much cheaper than even the shared vans) and close to buses and the streetcar and the cable car runs in front of the hotel. The staff was very helpful, particularly when my husband got sick in the middle of the night. Overall I'd return, but not for the usual rates unless they merited a larger room with more light and free or cheaper internet, since we always rely on our laptop for excursion planning, flight check in, etc. One other helpful feature is that they will store your luggage if you have an evening flight, of which we took advantage and made our last day there a lot more enjoyable."
"Review_12780","hotel_152","hotel_2474","Jun 24, 2008","Depends on your room I redeemed some points for a room here for 4 nights. It's in a great location, right on the trolley line on union square. Initial nights were in the tower. Tower rooms are small but adequate with nice views. Air conditioning in our room was very noisy, so when we complained, we were switched to the old building, and were given a corner room (reportedly the -06 and -34 rooms are the best) and loved it. Lots of room, lovely view over the square, high ceilings - really great. I had an unusually hard time activating the internet connection ($13/d). If I were to stay here again, I'd ask for the old building overlooking the square. However, I would stay here again."
"Review_12781","hotel_152","hotel_5068","Jun 19, 2008","Satisfactory stay I stayed at the Westin for the Endo conference over a weekend after getting it through priceline. After reading some reviews here, I was a little nervous (people complaining about small beds, rooms, etc). I was relieved when I was given a room with kingsize bed. Did not have any good views since I was on the 4th floor and did not expect any perks since I was paying probably a third of what others were paying. It was a room right next to the elevator, but it was surprisingly quiet. The room was small but with a king-size bed, so I did not care. The decor is outdated (eighties salmon pink), but simple enough so it wasn't obnoxious. The flat screen tv was nice but for some reason, not all the channels were available and the menu option was not working. The mini fridge had snacks and minibar which were weighed so you were charged even if you lifted them up (which I thought was a little money-grubby). And yeah, there's an extra charge for internet and the use of the gym.One thing that bothered me despite my low expectations was that there was many strands of hair on the floor the first time I walked into the bathroom (obviously not mine). That was kinda gross.Overall, I am satisfied with the deal that I got through priceline, but seriously doubt I would stay there if I had to pay full price. My friends stayed at Parc 55, and the decor was nicer, they had kickass view, the gym was free and well-equipped, and it was half the price of Westin."
"Review_12782","hotel_152","hotel_7723","Jun 16, 2008","Great stay at the St. Francis We spent the weekend at the Westin St. Francis. We arrived at the hotel via BART from SFO, it is only a short 3 block walk up Powell and if you are looking to save a little money riding BART is not a bad option. Once at the hotel there was a short check-in line, but there was an employee greeting people in the line and thanking them for their patience. Once thru the line we were quickly checked in and head up to our room on the 26th floor. It is definitely worth the little extra for a higher room because of the view, but mainly because of the glass elevator ride each time you go to and from the room. The room was a nice size and had a flat screen TV (with actual HD programming) and of course the heavenly bed was great. We used the concierge a couple of time and Glen was great giving suggestions for things to do and places to eat, and remembered our names the second day we saw him. However one of the other concierges was not as friendly and he acted as we were inconveniencing him with numerous questions. The location is great right on Union Square, close to shopping and adjacent to the cable car line. If you are spending multiple days get the MUNI 3-day pass it is only $18 and you can ride the cable cars, electric street cars and buses as much as you like during the 3 days and save some money, as it is $5 to ride one way on the cable car."

They moved us to a smaller room which stunk of cigarettes!! The staff weren't particuarly friendly. Although I had an amazing pedicure in the spa. The location is ok - beware of homeless people all outside though.

The food is not spectacular there are better value-price offerings in walking distance around the hotel. Their premium restaurant Michael Mina (named after the chef) supposed to be better, but according to the menue also in the upper price level. The hotel is located centrally right next to the union square right in the shopping district (Macy's, Nieman Marcus and a few more shopping malls and shopping streets are in walking distance). Also in walking distance is China Town and Fishermen's warf.

It's a wonderful location, right across the street from Union Square and just blocks from the city's Theater District.But my stay this past Memorial Day weekend was, overall, disappointing. First, the positives: the room was clean and the Heavenly Bed was as great as always! The lobby is lovely, and I love the way the hotel has leveraged its marvelous history by providing so many vintage pictures of its past glory days entertaining kings and presidents.The negatives, however, far outweighed the positives (at least on this visit):* Check-in was excruciatingly slow, even though we checked in at about 11 pm, with only one person in line in front of us. There were three people available to check guests in, but none was very efficient.* The coffee maker in our room was defective. When I called Service First to request a new one, the representative gave me the 5th degree on whether I'd properly operated the one in the room. We never did get a replacement, and decided to go to the Starbucks down the block instead.* There was paint peeling from the wall in the bathroom in about a 2 square foot area.* Even though I am a Starwood Gold Preferred Guest, we did not receive turndown service or a newspaper during our two nights at the St. Francis.* Our room had no hotel directory in the black portfolio provided in the room. Again, I contacted Service First to request one. It never came.I've stayed at the St. Francis five or six times in the past 5 years and--until now--have always had a very pleasant experience. I am hoping this past visit was an anomaly, not the beginning of a new trend."

It feels like your neighbors and people in the hallway are in the room with you at night. Save your money! Use the extra $49 a day to stay at a better hotel and the extra $14 dollars to shop or eat."

We called down disappointed because the room was very business like and cold. They put us in the historic portion of the hotel, which was much prettier and had the charm we were looking for. It still didn't have the big bathtub that the lady on the phone boasted about as fitting more than 2 people in- LOL it was nothing but a standard tub. The next day when we went to check out, we were charged a whopping $63.00 for parking ONE NIGHT in their structure. This included an extra $7.50 charge for having an over sized vehicle (Ford F250 with 4 inch lift) I was infuriated at the blatant highway robbery! When the valet drove it up, he stood there like one of the homeless people (which are swarming that area anyway) with his hand out until we gave him a buck... so make that $64.00 for parking!!!!!!!!"

My general sense was that there are some important improvements in service. I think that they do a great job in the spa. The hotel seems cleaner and the service that I received on this trip was really exceptional. The hotel let me do a late check out which really helped me out. I was trying to get down to Palo Alto and back and was able to do that by 1 pm. I just think that they have improved in many areas. My only note in this area (which is not hotel related) is that there are so many homeless who really need some help. That is true of this part of the City in general. It always creates a dilemma. You want to help out, but it is unclear what to do, but you can not walk a block without sometimes aggressively being approached. I wonder if the City could help out or if the businesses in the area could help them out. Tough issue and challenge."

It has retained its old charm and elegance, while incorporating modern touches and the restaurant, Michael Mina. It's Union Square location is perfect for first-time or seasoned San Francisco visitors, and is close to everything. The service was impeccable, the rooms quite large and room service was the best I have ever had. Although a bit pricey, the St. Francis is a must for anyone visiting San Francisco."

You never quite know what you're going to get on a points room, but we were really happy with our room.We were on the 31st floor - and though we did not get a view of the bridge - we did have a view of the City, the hills and part of the Bay.The room was large with a four-poster bed, a chaise lounge, desk, armoire, flat panel TV, two large closets (in one is a fullsize ironing board and iron) and a HUGE marble bathroom. The vanity has two sinks (and a fullsize blowdryer) and in our bath we had a cabinet that housed the mini fridge inside and the coffee maker and snacks on the top.Remember to NOT remove any items from the fridge unless you intend to pay for them!!The bed was comfy - though I thought the Heavenly Bed would be a little more cushy/soft - my boyfriend liked that it wasn't. The bedding was nice with lots of pillows.I loved having the chaise lounge in the room! That was where I plunked down every chance I got! I think the only problem with the room is that we could never get it cool enough - which during the day is fine, but at night trying to sleep at 73 degrees is uncomfortable. Not sure if they had the thermostat rigged so it wouldn't go cooler - or if it was just because of the insane heat (94 degrees) and that we were on such a high floor.The concierge is very helpful, the front desk very friendly and the valets were super accomodating if we needed to keep the car close and just run up to the room for a second. Remember parking in the hotel will run you around $55 for two days.We had reservations for Michael Mina (in the hotel) for Thursday night, but decided we weren't hungry enough to fully appreciate it, so we went up one block to the Clift Hotel and had a bite at Asia de Cuba. What a fun space!! Connected to the restaurant is the Rosewood Room which was really beautiful. Great drinks and the food was really good!There are so many great choices for food within walking distance to the St. Francis! But if you are looking for an incredible dining experience, check out Michael Mina - but call ahead for reservations. I've eatten at the one in Vegas and I booked my dinner almost a month in advance. The food is excellent!A great stay at the Westin St, Francis and I would definitely recommend this to others!!"

It also seems that the hotel's customer service was superb this time around.

As some of the other reviews stated, it's in an ideal location, with a cable car stop right on the corner, and then several more, located on Powell Street. The concierge was particularly helpful, recommending great restaurants, and the entire staff of the hotel was very friendly and accomodating.The rooms were very nice, decorated in a classic style reminiscent of your typical San Francisco architecture. Despite the fact that my view was less than desirable, in a fantastic city like San Fran, there are amazing views on every corner!"

The front desk was very helpfull. The bellman were all so kind to us. Best of all when I booked our stay I put a note with our reservation that we were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary there and could we have a good view from our room. We got a great view  Champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a huge chocolate cake on a plate with chocolate writing saying Happy 10th wedding anniversary.

Some noise at night, but we did not mind that at all since were traveling as a couple without the kids. A fantastic deal for $99 plus taxes through Priceline. Rooms were small but we were very clean and confortable with the Flat screen TV and super comfortable queen bed. Starbucks coffee in the room. USA Today and Wall Street Journal (reception) in the morning. Twin shower heads in Marble bathroom. Westin could invest a little to do some minor painting and minor touch ups."
"Review_12807","hotel_152","hotel_10540","Apr 13, 2008","nice hotel, overpriced I got a special rate for a conference at this hotel... really the rate was not all that special at $279/night. And I was disappointed to have to pay $12/day for the gym... a tiny, cramped, 2-room gym w/ old equip and only 3 elliptical machines. The hotel is beautiful in the lobby area and some of the larger conference rooms are very ornate. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice room, comfy bed and nice shower... I'm just glad my company was paying. For my money, I would have tried to find a better value. Although, I'm pretty sure that the rate has something to do with the Union Square location as well."
"Review_12808","hotel_152","hotel_6078","Apr 12, 2008","Great - but beware if a smoker! So I spent five nights at the Westin back in February. We booked at a supposed reduced rate as we had a conference in the Moscone, but soon afterwards I heard that some people were getting their rooms for under $100 - ah well, not to worry.I also saw some split reviews for the St Francis which sort of worried us but we needn't have been concerned. The hotel is very big and whilst my room was quite small and overlooking a wall, I didn't go to SF to stay in my room so it wasn't a problem. The bed was comfy as all Westin's tend to be, and the shower was fine. I did have an issue where I couldn't turn off my tap (probably because I am a bit of a spanner), but it was quickly sorted.Staff were very friendly and helpful and you couldn't ask for a better location on Union Square!The only niggle I had and this is purely because I am a smoker, is that it was quite disconcerting smoking outside the building before the bell-hops got on duty as there was a tendency for every homeless person on Union Square to congregate around you. Those who fly in to SF from Europe will know all about the 'wake up at 4:00 syndrome' and smokers will recognise the need for a smoke when you wake up - just don't go outside before 06:30 (or try one of the other two entrances).All in all, a decent place in a good location with reasonable prices. Just don't take/hire a car - it was $50 a day or thereabouts to park!!!"
"Review_12809","hotel_152","hotel_8238","Apr 11, 2008","not a good hotel.... I spent Tuesday night this week in the Westin St. Francis and it was absolutely the worst hotel stay I have had in years. Checking in was fine but they had no 'standard rooms' available so I was asked if I would upgrade and stay in a union square view room that had a murphy bed. I specifically asked when checking in if the murphy bed was of the same quality as the heavenly beds. I was assured it was.The room was ok (nice flat screen TV), but I had asked them to turn down the bed (ie: flip it down from the wall) while i was out at dinner. Arriving back later I ended up in a bed with a 10 cm thick mattress, springs that could be felt through the sheet and this WAS NOT a Heavenly Bed!!! It was absolutely brutal and just like a hide a bed on an old sofa bed. For 300 per night i was shocked.Then to top it all off the lady in the room next door started smoking at 5am, in a non smoking hotel. I eventually called at 645am and security came and stopped the nonsense. So with the bed being the most important thing i was looking for being completely disappointing, I would have checked out on that basis alone, the smoking was just too much. I will never stay in this hotel again and cannot believe just how bad it was. This hotel is OLD, needs a renovation desperately so wait until this hotel with a great location does that and then you can stay here."

The lobby is beautiful as are the rooms with crown molding and very high ceilings. We saw three rooms while there and they are all very different. Some are very,very small. If you do not like your room, ask to change. They accommodated us and we ended up with a great corner room. Do not accept any room with a 24 as an ending, like 724 or 824. These rooms abut the elevator which begins running at 5:30 AM. Also stay away from the Oak Room for breakfast, It cost us $140 for 4. We could not believe the prices for such an ordinary breakfast. Instead grab a coffee or juice along with a yogurt or bagel in the lobby deli. It will get you started for the day without spending all your money you will need later to shop on the Square."

The grand deluxe rooms are basically higher-floor rooms in the tower. Ours appeared to be one of the smaller ones, and one of the few that faced west over the city rather than east over the bay, with part of the view blocked by a concrete bay.The Westinized room renovation appeared several years old and was in pretty bad shape. The walls were dirty, and all of the dark wood furniture and trim had bad nicks and scratches. The furniture in the main lobby was even worse - the cushions on the couches basically had no padding left.Service was friendly enough, but the only thing we specifically asked for (paper every day, WSJ + local paper) they never got right.Good location, but there must be better choices in SF."

"Review_12816","hotel_152","hotel_5202","Mar 24, 2008","Rip Off The Westin St. Francis is a historic hotel in San Francisco. There are 2 towers, the older one and the newer building. I was first given a room on the 10th floor in the older tower. It was horrible, the room smelled of urine from the bathroom, there was a horrible view of concrete from the building in front of it, the bed looked slept in, and the paint was coming off the ceiling. I wish I could remember the room #. After I complained, I was given a room in the new building. It was much more modern and clean. It was on the 16th floor and that, sadly to say was one of the highlights of the hotel it self, riding up and down the elevator.  The concierge desk was not helpful at all. Very minimal advice, unpleasant, no personality, no smiles!  Lastly and most importantly, A major rip off!!! You have to PAY for everything. I was charged $35.00 for using the internet in the business center for 20 mins. 6.00 for 2 copies. 14.99 a day for internet in the room, 12.00 o use the spa! Absolutely ridiculous. Don't stay here it wasn't Orth it. You'd be better off in a boutique hotel than the Westin!!!"
"Review_12817","hotel_152","hotel_5063","Mar 12, 2008","poor value We stayed at this hotel from 6 鈥?11 March 2008. We had accumulated enough Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) points for 2/5 nights to be free. We booked through SPG in early January and were told that the booked room was basic but that it should be easily upgradeable on arrival once blocks of rooms had been released as 鈥渨e always strive to take care of our SPG guests鈥? Upon arrival we were assigned one of the smallest rooms in the old part of the hotel. The only other thing available had a Murphy bed! The attitude of the front desk was take it or leave it. Oh well鈥?The room indeed was small but also on the worst side of the hotel. Each evening we were treated to drummers, rock bands or bag pipes on the sidewalk outside our room. Ear plugs solved that problem. A sensor on the door that controlled the air handling unit malfunctioned on the first night and chirped at us for several hours. Maintenance did come and fix it quickly once we figured out what it was. The room was so small that every time we took a shower the water vapor would make the smoke detector chirp at us. Since the window was frozen shut, we solved that problem by propping open the room door to the hall. The maintenance man did apologize for that but basically told us it was a function of the room being small. The peeling paint on the bathroom ceiling is also due to poor ventilation, but we were able to wash the flakes down the drain when we showered. We had 4 interactions with the front desk personnel. 3 of 4 encounters had all the charm of checking into a Motel 8. One young woman stared at her computer screen and never looked at us the entire time we were in front of her. She had us furnish all of our personal info, ID and credit card all over again when we transitioned from the 2 鈥渞eward鈥?nights to regular nights. When I asked why we had to do so, her response was 鈥渢hat it was easier this way鈥? I was so dumfounded that I did not ask the logical question of 鈥渇or whom?鈥?Not all was lost, however. We were simply walking by at one point when a front desk woman greeted us and wished us a nice day. I watched her do this to many people in the lobby and when she had a customer in front of her, she was pleasant, smiling and courteous to all. On the positive side, housekeepers, the doormen and bellmen were excellent. The concierge service was delightful and surpassed our expectations. This was our first test of the SPG reward program and it did not meet our expectations. On the whole the experience was just simply 鈥淥k鈥? Given the number of points we surrendered for 2 free nights and the expense of the regular nights, we felt we that just being 鈥淥k鈥?is poor value in return. We travel to San Francisco frequently and in the future we will happily settle for an equivalent room and service at a less well known chain for a lower price. Alternatively, we will only have to spend a bit more than we did at the St. Francis if we want a more luxurious experience. The SPG program will not be a factor in any future hotel reservations. If we wind up accruing points through whatever mechanism, that will be nice, but we will not be going out of our way to do so. The purpose of any reward program is to generate loyalty and repeat business. In this case it has had the opposite effect."
"Review_12818","hotel_152","hotel_10450","Mar 11, 2008","Historical Hotel in Convenient Setting Having read the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor, I was somewhat hesitant to stay at the St. Francis. There were complaints about the property's upkeep, specifically in the older building bordering Union Square, and also allegations of bad service. I cannot comment on the condition of the older building, but the newer skyrise was absolutely fantastic. We stayed on the 27th floor which offered amazing views of Union Square, the financial district, the East Bay Bridge, the Coit Tower, and several other areas of the city. Our room was very sleek with the typical Westin heavenly shower and bed, along with an ample work space. The room service was very attentive, the concierge very knowledgeable, and the front desk very helpful with all inquiries. Perhaps the older part of the property isn't worth the price of admission, but the skyrise is more, shall we say, Westin. The entrance and reception areas are very cool, mixing San Francisco's bygone elegance with its hip modern persona. As far as the property's location, it doesn't get any better. The trolley system stops at your front door on Powell and you're within walking distance to all the major shopping in the city, as well as several excellent restaurants. I was very satisfied with my stay."

I have bounced between the W, St. Regis  St. Francis. What I do like about the St. Francis is the old section overlooking Union Square because the ceilings are high and the rooms have that sense of old San Francisco that I remember as a child staying there with my family. However, the best part is that the windows open wide letting in the cool S.F. air and the sounds of the city complete with the clanging cable cars traveling up and down Powell St. A view over Union Square to Tiffanys, Macys  Nieman is so cIt y. It really doesn't get much better than that for a city experience. If you can time it right be sure to book a lower Union Square room to watch the Chinese New Year parade from your window.What I don't like about the St. Francis is that the new gourmet retaurant that has taken over what was one of the most wonderful hotel bars in the city. Nothing against the restaurant itself as I have yet to dine there. Cocktails are now relegated to the lobby which diminishes what was once a Grand entrance. Now the lobby is kept impossibly dim littered with too warn, never were attractive furnishings.All in all, I will probably opt sometime again in the future for the Union Square experience; but I do miss the bathrooms at the St. Regis."

I walked down the street to the Westin St. Francis and walked directly up to the front desk and talked with a very friendly clerk. I explained my situation and asked if there were rooms available. I am a government employee and was on official business, and explained as such and asked if there were rooms available at the government rate. The clerk was more than helpful and was able to assist me. I explained that my family would be joining me on my last night and asked for a family friendly room. She said she would put me in a special room that she thought I would like. Needless to say, I was put into a HUGE room that was way more than adequate and way more than what I am used to while traveling on business! My only regret was that I hadn't stayed in this hotel the previous days!The staff at the Westin St. Francis were all more than helpful in helping us and making special accommodations that I had requested - a cot, a refrigerator, etc...

We arrived from London, and found the hotel quite quickly from the airport. We were in a deluxe room in the tower - and had a great view over Union Square. Do book a tower room, as I believe the historic rooms leave a lot to be desired. We only ate at the hotel for one breakfast (we stayed for 5 days) - and the food was pretty good. The bar wasn't great, but due to the fantastic location there are a number of cooler bars quite close by.The staff (esp. behind the desk and the concierge) were extremely helpful - and the only negative was the cost of parking at the hotel - or SUV was oversized and we were charged over $60 a day to park at the hotel. But, it is an expensive/premium hotel. All in all, a great hotel, and certainly one that I would use again (in fact I'm booked to go back in a couple of months)."

I've just returned from staying in the Westin St Francis while I attended a convention in town and spent a few days site seeing.The location is great (for shopping, not really for the covention centre), very central and right next to the cable car stop.The lobby of the hotel is impressive, and I have never seen so many entrances to one hotel, but the hotel room itself was tiny. I've had small rooms before, but this was the smallest I have ever stayed in. It was so small that the (very nice!) flatscreen TV had to be placed to the side of the bed at a very inconvenient angle so it was difficult to comfortably watch it. The bathroom was nice, good fittings and a nice shower. The bed itself was very comfortable and large.The only real complaint I have about this hotel is the way their mini bar system works. The mini bar/fridge was in a cupboard under the tv, which I used to store some documents in (the cupboard, not the fridge!). At no point did I even open the fridge, yet on the day I was due to depart I was given a mini bar bill for over $200! I spoke with reception, who were very off hand about it and insisted I must have removed things from the fridge as it is sensored. I insisted I had done no such thing, at which point they said even opening the door of the cupboard could set the sensors off and if I wanted to avoid getting a bill next time I shouldn't open the cupboard! They cancelled the charges, which was fine, but by that time they had already requested the money from my visa card so my bank back home stopped my card due to the large international transaction! It seems crazy that they can't get a mini bar which can tell the difference between you removing an item and opening the cupboard in which the mini bar is stored!! Anyway this is just a gripe of mine, the hotel was nice, and central and the other staff I encountered were very polite and helpful. Careful of the coffee shop/bar though - we went in there on 3 seperate occassions and they charged us 3 different prices for the same drinks!!"

We received a very warm welcome on our arrival  it all looked promising. We had just arrived from a very long international flight and had an extremely tired baby who needed to sleep. I had previously emailed and called from Australia to confirm a cot would be in our room on arrival. The girl checking us in advised it was not there yet but would be sent up immediately. After at least half and hour it still had not arrived so we decided to take her out for a walk. On our way through reception we asked again  were assured it would be sent straight up. An hour and a half later we returned - still no cot! We finally rang exasperated and pleaded for one - finally it came about 20 minutes later. Not quite good enough  something so simple should not take 3 requests.Other than that, the paint was pealing off the ceiling in our bathroom which was surprising and not up to standard for such a property.This is an extremely busy hotel so not the place to stay for a quiet relaxing time, however it is in a fantastic location and we were able to walk or take the cable car everywhere. The room was spacious and comfortable  other than the pealing paint it was very nice. Staff were mostly all very friendly  overall we did enjoy our stay."
"Review_12826","hotel_152","hotel_8115","Feb 20, 2008","Great service We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights Feb 16-19. We booked through travelocity and got a great deal with flights included. Our room was in the newer tower on the 16th floor and the rooms were of a good size. The elevator is something that you have to get used to if you don't like heights because it is a glass elevator which goes pretty fast. It does have a great view if you go a little higher to get above the rest of the skyline, we took a ride to the top floor and the view was amazing. When we arrived from the airport we took the BART to the Powell st exit and the hotel is a few blocks up the street. Also there is a kiosk right as you exit the Bart station to by multi-day passes for the muni transportation, which includes the cable cars. We checked our luggage and went to lunch because we were a bit too early for checkin. Check-in was very smooth and they sent up our bags immediately, I think we might have been in our room for 1-2 minutes when it arrived. Another time we called because we couldn't get our safe to work and again the service was excellent, help arrived within 5 mins. As mentioned in other reviews this location is perfect. With easy access to alot of public transportation and also taxis are always outside the hotel.There was one negative that we had the heating system made a very large clunking noise right before it was turning off. It did wake me up a few times. Another thing that I didn't mind but some might is that the bathroom was a shower only set-up."
"Review_12827","hotel_152","hotel_5622","Feb 19, 2008","Average hotel, great location I travel to San Francisco regularly for work and have stayed at the Westin St. Francis for a total of three weeks over the past four months. Overall, the hotel is charming and the rooms are nice albeit visibly worn. Despite this, all the beds and showers are Westin's signature heavenly brand and therefore very comfortable. Most important, is the location of the hotel. Overlooking Union Square and steps away from shops galore, it's a refreshing change from staying at other hotels downtown, which can be located in the business area and therefore quite dead at night. I also prefer to be a little bit further from the business area just to have a change of scenery when I am done at the office.I would recommend the Westin St. Francis to anyone who likes the same and enjoys being in a more lively part of town. The hotel may be a bit old but the location certainly more than makes up for it!"

The hotel is in a great location, the bed was very comfortable as was the dual head shower. The room itself was very small, but clean. There was no view at all, but for $99 I didn't really expect one. My only complaint is that the walls are very thin. We were awaken by the staff vacuuming at 7:30am, cleaning someone's dishes in the hallway, etc. I felt we got a good deal for $99, I wouldn't pay more than that."

We had a large, light corner room in the old section. However, the overall condition of the hotel was rather shabby - dim, poorly furnished lobby, paint and wallpaper peeling off the wall of our room, hooks in the bathroom falling out of the wall (and then just left there by the maid for 2 days), no light, paper or pen on the desk, no information about the hotel amenities (no pool?!) other than we had to pay $12/day per person to use the gym. The amenities are nicer at the Holiday Inn Express in any podunk town in America. Too bad, because this is a beautiful landmark hotel."

My husband was there for a conference and I was on holildays.The hotel looks good. The lobby is quite nice. We were in a king room in the older part of the building. The room was a good size if not big. The decoration was simple and a bit tired but pleasant.The location is really what made us choose the St Francis. Being right on Union Square it is hugely practical. Cable cars at the front, BART at the end of powell street and plenty of buses around for those wanting to catch public transport. Cabs always easy to get for the others. The walk to Fisherman's wharf takes about 25 minutes (Powell street is very steep!) and walking to the ferry terminal (to go to Sausalito) takes 10 to 15minutes if you go down post st and then market st.On the cons side, the service was poor. Sitting at the bar at the front if the hotel we had to wait 15 to 20 min for a drink. The other bar in the lobby wasn't very attractive and was very noisy. It felt like you were sitting at the check in counter. Concierge seemed quite annoyed when we asked for restaurant recommendations! Being more of a business hotel, it was quite noisy for 8am onwards.I would probably not recommend this hotel for a vacation."
"Review_12832","hotel_152","hotel_9505","Feb 12, 2008","Westin St Francis is a stunning hotel overall I stayed for three nights at the Westin St Francis in the newer tower building.As there were no twins available I had originally booked a standard double in the historic building but was shown to a standard queen room instead. The room was beautiful, though small, and everything was neat and clean. I had read reviews on this site that the older smaller rooms were dated and dirty but this was not the case at all. I did however get an extremely strange feeling in the room, and was not keen to stay for a reason that is unknown to me! We asked to be upgraded to the newer part of the hotel for an additional $35.00 per night, and as we left the old part of the hotel I mentioned to my sister that my right ear started ringing loudly as soon as we entered the room. She said her right ear was also ringing in the historic room... very spooky!Anyway, having upgraded to the tower room with two queen beds, we had absolutely no complaints. The room was massive, and the bathroom was incredible! The beds were heavenly as promised, and the dual shower was great too. It was well worth the extra money for the upgrade. The only thing even slightly disapointing was the view, (of some old buildings), but you can't have everything.Staff were friendly and helpful and the public areas of the hotel are stunning. I really enjoyed watching the documentary on the hotel tv channel about the history of the St Francis- fascinating!I would definitely love to return to the St Francis in the future."

As you've no doubt read elsewhere, the hotel is ideally located in the city, close to great shopping, sight-seeing, restaurants and all the excitement that was around Super Tuesday! It had us enraptured, even though we were visiting from abroad!The hotel checked us in, and we were given a very spacious room on the 10th floor of the tower block; the room was serviced every day; there was a coffee maker, hair-dryer, flat-screen tv, arm-chair, desk, and so on within the room. We found the concierge especially helpful throughout our stay. And we were only sad to leave!"
"Review_12835","hotel_152","hotel_9866","Jan 23, 2008","Nice rooms and public area, very poor service This was my third time at the hotel. The first time I was put in the old building, and our room was terrible. The second time they comped my stay--had a great room overlooking Union Square in the new tower. This third time I booked 3 rooms. As an SPG gold member, I usually get upgrades. But the women who checked us in, would not even give us the king room we booked. My wife insisted on talking with the manager and we finally got our king room (but no upgrade). The room was in the old building, but it was recently renovated. The rooms was well furnished and appointed. But the service at the hotel is terrible. In addition to the check-in fiasco, we couldn't find a bellperson. They have one doorman for a 600+ room hotel. We ended up carrying our own luggage (including stroller) inside. Upon coming and going to the hotel, the doorman (even when he was not busy) never offered to help us lift our stroller over the steps of the hotel's front entrance. We asked the conceirge to recommend a good place for sushi. After a 5 minute wait, he came back with some places. We asked what he particuarly liked about them, and he said he just searched on Google for sushi. We ended up finding something ourselves since we know the area pretty well. So if you need a nice room in a good location, the St. Francis will fit the bill. But after staying in many SF hotels (we used to live in the city), we prefer the Omni, which has amazing service. Other good options are the Grand Hyatt and Marriott, both of which have better service than the St. Francis."

Both were fantastic, and surprisingly about half the price normally charged by hotels in this league. All around best hotel experience I have had on the West Coast."

The hotel itself smells a little old and it's a little dark too. We arrived at 10:30 am and the front desk managed to let us check in early, which was a plus. We were in the Historical Building and we were on the 4th floor. Our room totally looked onto Union Square and there were no obstructions. I had some issues with the hotel staff with helping me with directions and using the internet costs a min. of $10 (what a joke). The location is great, but not the best hotel.

I recently spend a week at the St Francis on business; It was a fright from the moment I got to my floor. The doorman, front desk staff, and bell staff were attentive, but didn't warn me about my room... It was on a newly renovated floor that smelled of mothballs (I was told it was the new carpet), the whole 11th floor smelled so my window (which opened) was of little help. The bell staff that escorted me to my room noticed immediately that the room was not made up properly and left to collect the towels, robe, and missing pillow. The amenities were less then I would expect, I've received better at a Hampton Inn. They were happy to press my suits, but were unable to shine my shoes. Housekeeping skipped my room twice during my stay, and the hotel never offered an apology; only a they'll be right up. All in all, it was a beautiful hotel, but the room was far too small (albeit a old hotel) for the price and the door banged into the bed when I opened it.For the money, stay at the ritz or four seasons..."

We did not use the mini bar as the cost was expensive. The fridge had a sensor so we were worried about even opening the fridge!

It's reasonably priced, very close to Fisherman's Wharf, has free parking for one car, and the rooms are OK. Stay away from the mini-suite on the second floor at the corner of Mason  Bay; it's one of the noisiest hotel rooms I've ever had the pleasure of being moved from. Great view, though. If you want quiet, you have to put up with the view of the adjacent building."
"Review_12844","hotel_153","hotel_5485","Oct 20, 2008","Some good points but wouldn't stay again First the good points:The location is excellent, one block up and right between Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The hotel offers free parking and you can continue to use their parking up until 3pm on the day of checkout. The room was large including a couch and the bathroom was good-sized. The room was also clean.Now for the bad:There was no fan except a quiet ceiling fan which meant that every noise was easily heard all night such as doors slamming, people in neighboring rooms and street noise. This made for difficult sleep. Also, we were there when the weather in SF was 80 during the day and the room was very warm and stuffy. No air conditioning or even a wall unit fan for white noise.If you are a heavy sleeper this hotel might be okay but after a long day of walking around we were tired and just wanted a good night's rest and we didn't get that due to the noise. We usually stay in SF a few times a year as we live only an hour away. This was our first time at the Wharf Inn. On previous visits we have stayed at the Handlery on Union Square but their rates this time of year were a bit high for us but it is a great hotel and we've never had the noise problems we had here. I wouldn't stay here again."

Negative to say is, that the walls of the Hotel are very thin. we were able to hear the words of our neighbours. We got a room with wall view, but the postive thing was that we didn't hear the street noises. The staff in the lobby was a bit lazy, but friendly.

We also travel with two teen age grandchildren. Directly across the street from the Wharf Inn is a 7-11 convenience store and a Subway sandwich shop. We always take along reusable bowls and spoons, so we are able to have a quick breakfast of cereal and fruit( found at the 7-11). Subway has many specials and healthy options.

We didn't have much time in San Francisco (just Friday evening and the next morning) so I felt by staying at Fisherman's Wharf we were able to make the best of the time we had. We booked an evening tour of Alcatraz. The departure was just a short walk from he hotel. It was nice to be able to walk and enjoy the shops at night and find a restaurant for breakfast the next morning.The room was pretty good, but nothing fancy We had two queen beds and paid for a rolloway. There was high speed internet. We had a room in the back facing a wall, so there was no view. That was OK . The bathroom was suprisingly large and nice (shower no tub). The management was very helpful in getting us directions both to get to the Alcatraz tour and to the airport in Oakland the next day.The price was a lot more than I have paid for similar rooms in other cities, but it was much cheaper than other rooms in Fishermans Wharf area.

I guess compared to the prices of other places nearby, this was a bargain, but you have some stuff to deal with. Rooms were a little warm...had to sleep with windows open, which made all the street noise that much louder. It was nice to be in walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf and the cable cars.I would probably stay there again, but would go for the Penthouse and take some ear plugs or sominex to help you sleep.Bring your own hairdryer...you have to get one from the front desk and they are not very good.

There were loud and obnoxious drunk Mexicans partying until 3AM on a Wednesday night and nobody took care of this problem. It sounded so loud it seemed they were in the room with us. I know people were complaining because I heard other residents asking them to quiet down. Anyway they just eventually passed out I think.The shower in the morning never got hot. Also very poor water pressure.Also they make you sign this agreement when you check in with all kinds of fines listed. This seemed very unprofessional. I strongly recommend staying at a better hotel in the Fisherman Wharf area.I never write bad reviews but I have been back from my vacation for 5 days now and I am still enraged that this poorly maintained/run hotel ruined the end of my vacation."

Since the hotel was across the street from a 7-11, there is alot of car traffic noise, especially the night we stayed. In the mornings around 6 or 7 am, the street cleaners slam the metal grates down when cleaning the sidewalk. Overall, a hard place to get a good nights sleep.

Unpretentious, The Wharf Inn does not try to be an over-priced luxury hotel, but we did not go to SF to spend time in a jacuzzi! In a city where most of the hotels are very old and the reviews commonly report smallish rooms (Charming) and very tight bathrooms, we felt fortunate to have a room that was spacious enough for two couples to share and was furnished with two comfortable queen-sized beds. The staff was courteous, professional and helpful. You could not ask for a better location--a short block from Fisherman's Wharf and right on a trolley line--also a short walk to a cable car line. A huge plus is FREE parking -- worth $25-$40 a day in the city. Free wireless internet was provided.

Maybe just an impression but.....So I recommend only if you don't pass many time in the room and want to spend as cheap as possible still taking advantage of the good location"
"Review_12868","hotel_154","hotel_2341","Jun 26, 2008","Excellent location and quiet place to stay in SF! We stayed there respectively 3 and 1 nights this month and we can highly recommend this motel: kind and helpfull man who runs the motel. Clean place and above all close to all locations you want to visit, either by walking or taking a bus. One block away from the noisy Lombard street and consequently a lot quieter to sleep! We payed an average of 97 USD tax incl. per night for the first 3 nights and only 73 USD tax incl. for the last night with a coupon. Only one disadvantage: when the motel is full there is not enough parking! Anyway, we can highly recommend this affordable motel and would choose it again."

This is a great place to stay for the budget conscious traveller, but if you are looking for extra amenities or luxury, this is not the place for you.Pros: PRICE, location (very near the shops and restaurants on Chestnut and close to Golden Gate Bridge), friendly staff, clean rooms, FREE Parking, ample parkingCons: rooms are small, no telephone, thin walls. It is a quite neighborhood and I felt safe, but due to the thin walls you can hear the street traffic at times. If you are a light sleeper or in need of major relaxation, this could be a definite issue."

Paid only US$64 per night. I stayed 2 week nights. Towels were clean, Bedsheets were a little stained. Toilet seat was a bit old. Did not experience any bed bugs or see any cockroaches running around. Hotel wasn't secured. Anybody can come up and knock on your door or window. But I didn't experience anything throughout the 2 days. Parking was free. Parking looks limited but I managed to get a space for both nights. Free Wifi. Overall it's ok if you just need a room to bath and sleep."
"Review_12873","hotel_154","hotel_1175","Apr 28, 2008","Everything was OK Stayed here one Saturday night April 08. Price was $78 plus tax =$90.02. with free auto parking. Room 17, directly above the small reception office. I was expecting worse, but the room and overall experience exceed my expectations. Most of the other reviews appear to be on target. My room was very clean, no stains, bathroom very clean with no crud nor mold. Room comes with hair dryer, iron, small ironing board, small refrig, coffee maker with one pack, TV with remote, but no mircowave. I made the reservation on-line at the last moment, and this was one of the less expensive motels in this area with a vacancy. The Lombard/Cow Hollow strip has over two dozen motels/motor lodges of different age,quality and price. I did not try to contact any motel directly by phone, however I saw upon arrival in the area that many still had a vacancy sign on. The street noise was very loud in the room but dropped off later in the evening. Parking was tight and there were no empty spaces when I left in the morning. I left the car parked and traveled by bus #45 via Union street to ATT baseball park. As I am very familar with San Francisco, the location in the north section of the city is not a problem. The publicity photo of the front of the hotel does not do the property justice. It is better than it looks. The office staff was friendly and my contact minimal. You could do better but expect to pay anywhere from $30-90 more."

The price was right and it was all we needed (pretty basic).PROS: *Bob the manager- He was incredibly helpful and hospitable. Thank you Bob! *Location- Right off Lombard, about mile from the Wharf. *Skylight in bathroom- Definitely nice to have some natural light in the bathroom. *Across the street from Mel's diner, a 24 hour restaurant. *About a block from Chestnut Street, which has tons of little shops and restaurants, and the Muni bus.CONS: *Noise- Walls are thin, garbage trucks were loud and woke me up about 3 times during the night (and I'm a heavy sleeper!) *Heater was loud. We had to keep it off just to sleep, and woke up cold. *Broken vending machine- no sign put on. *No clock in our room.All in all, the CONS were minimal and we were only in the room to sleep and shower, so this place was suitable for our needs."
"Review_12875","hotel_154","hotel_4872","Mar 24, 2008","Pretty nice motel We stayed at the Greenwich Inn for one night in March 2008. We were seeing a concert in Larkspur, but wanted to stay in the city. The location is very nice and seemed pretty mellow and safe. Save for some machinery noise early Sunday morning, it was a pretty quiet place to stay. Shutters on the windows were a nice touch. The room offered dimension, which a separate closet area, which prevented the feeling of staying in a box, which is common with hotels. One of the coolest amenities, which was a nice surprise, was a huge skylight in the restroom. Being a huge fan of natural light while getting ready in the morning, I loved this feature. Free/safe/ample parking is also a plus. This property actually sprawls across either side of Steiner, and one minor inconvenience is that there is only one ice machine for both buildings, and we stayed at the ice-less location and had to walk across the street at 1am just to get some ice. Also, there is no breakfast offered in the lobby (not even a muffin!), but IHOP is right around the block and San Francisco's favorite Mel's Diner is just a few steps from the motel. Nice place for the price. Will stay again."

I concur with other posters, management is not very cooperating into resolving the matter. Getting one incident is concerning for a hotel manager, but as many as mentionned in that forum shows lack of customer service. But i have tools for the (poor) folks that runned into the same trouble: look at Wikipedia as they have good tips into removing the bugs from you luggage. If your from Canada or northern countries: keep your luggages outside for a while (freeze kills the bugs) or do like we did: wash everything in hot water then dry for at least half an hour and you will get it out. Oh and by the way, we are still waiting for reimbursement of our stay as promised from the hotel...I do not count on it... Cheers!"

All others I strongly recommend STAY AWAY from this place. Ok, its fairly cheap on weekdays about $65, and as far a San Fransisco goes its quite economical, but can be an unbelievable $130 per night for a room at weekends. However, in the room we stayed you would be hesitant to keep farm animals. The bed covers were more cigarette holes than bed cover, the inner sheets also, the windows dont lock so that anyone can reach around and open the door, there's not even headboards so you rest your head against the depressingly yellow walls and the divan cases are zipped up inside a sealed plastic sheet, probably to lock in the swarming bed bugs, yes I said BED BUGS !! which kept us company for the night in both beds. If the sharps box in the bathroom hasn't already given it away, then look out the bathroom window and you are greeted with the majestic sight of a narrow alley littered with junkies needles and equipment. By the way there's no air-con so can be stifling in the tiny cramped rooms in summer. Lastly if that doesnt keep you awake the ancient hot water pipes banging like a salvation army drum everytime one of your neighbours turns on a tap surely will. We were booked in for 2 mights but couldnt risk our lives for a second night and had to check out and go elsewhere. Found a nice ramada on the corner of buchanan and lombard street for $$140. The extra $10 well worth it, roomy, clean, safe, nearer the attractions and you're not sharing it with the local wildlife."

I investigated the bug I found on me at 3am on the internet to discover that BED BUGS were real. I never believed the stories on reviews about them, until I experienced it. I actually saw this strange flat brown bug walking across the table before I went to bed, and never thought more about it, but found out on the net later that this was actually the adult form of the bed bug. The noise at this place is horrible too, and the area feels extremely unsafe, with drug addicts and drunks walking around. Our car did survive the experience in their parking lot (surprisingly). I was third in line to check out, and the third one that was making a complaint. I did receive a full refund."

I went online to see what the review for the hotel was cause the place at a second look seemed run down. We had a roof rack on the car and I didn't like the look of the neighborhood. It was late at night and we had our 15 month old child with us, so driving didn't seem much of an option, at 11 at night. I went online to see the big red flag of bed bugs! We looked through the sheets, under the mattress even though we both hadn't seen a bed bug before, we thankfully didn't see any bugs at all. We got ready for bed and there it was a bug crawling up the wall. I immediately googled it after my husband killed it, and it was a bed bug! My husband went directly to management to say we were leaving and the clerk said he would deduct 19 dollars off our stay if we stayed in the room. No Thank You! How can a hotel that knows that it has bed bugs keep open? Shouldn't it be shut down? We shook out all of our belongings cause if a bed bug gets into your home, your home is infested as well. Bed bugs are hard to get rid of. Someone I know had to burn all of his furniture when they got infested."

The bathroom was OK. The beds were comfortable enough. However the decor was in major need of upgrading. There was peeling paper and plater from the walls. There was alot of dust on the very wron out alomost thread bare carpet.Each time we used the shower which in itself was a task, it sounded as though a train was passing next to the room.

We were all on a budget but we still wanted to stay close to downtown. The hotel itself was fine, it was pretty clean, and it was close to the BART (Bay area rapid transit) which we used often. The walk to Union Square was lenghty but manageable however it is through a rougher neighborhood. We instead often opted for the bus or subway which ran almost every other minute. It was also close to the Haight area which was great for dining. The biggest problems we had with the hotel were:the water heater sounded like a jackhammer everytime the water was used, the continental breakfast was orange juice, coffee, and pre-packaged sara lee style sticky buns, lastly, some of us ended up having bug bites on our arms and such, but we have no way of telling what it was from.

But my last stay there was by far the worst experience i have had at a hotel so I will never be staying there again.The first red flag is that there are signs posted all over the grounds that say that there are toxic chemicals on the premises that cause cancer and birth defects. when i inquired about it at the front desk i was told that it is California state law to put up the signs because they use chemical cleaners and that all hotels in CA including the hilton would have the same signs. All I know is that i have never seen a sign like that in any hotel I have stayed at. Then, in our non-smoking room there were burn holes in all of the furniture and blankets.In the morning, we had was a noise issue. We had had a very late night and were counting on sleeping in. We were woken up at 9am to a loud machine type of noise right outside our room. At first we thought it might be construction or something else beyond the control of the hotel. We then realized that the noise was the result of the hotel staff power-wash bleaching the exterior corridors of the hotel. we complained to the front desk and they told us that there were no power-washers. since we could see, hear and smell the power-washing, that was pretty bizarre thing to say. nothing was done about the power washing and it went on for over an hour and a half. at that point my friend went down and complained in person and was granted a $20 refund and no apology what-so-ever.Problem #2: bed bugs:2 hours later when we were trying to get some work done in the room something suddenly caught my eye. it was a bug. a bed bug. in my bed. We went on to find 2 more and were completely disgusted. When the bugs were squashed they left little blood stains on the white sheets - apparently because they had bitten us. It was repulsive. We immediately complained to the front desk who demonstrated absolutely no level of shock or apology. i stress here, absolutely NO APOLOGY or explanation. In fact, when we said that we wanted to check out immediately and he said fine, check out. I wanted a full refund on account of the infested guest room and i was told that no further discount could be offered since we had already received a $20 discount for the noise. I called travelodge customer service and was told that there was nothing that they could do. They said i had to talk to the hotel manager. The hotel manager was the horribly unpleasant character who had been working the front desk all morning. I later received a letter from customer service simply stating the exact same thing: that there was nothing that they could do. How about sending an inspector over to assess the extent of the infestation? Isn't this a serious health code violation?I have stayed at many travelodge locations in the past. And, I can't stress enough how unacceptable this experience was. I am very disappointed in Travelodge for providing this kind establishment."

Parking is extra ($10/n). I've stayed here several times over the years. Physically the place is an older hotel that has been remodeled couple years ago to meet corporate standards. Somewhat worn. Marble tile bathroom. Doors lock securely. Check window locks. Like most in the area hotel only has heat and fan, no AC.Mgmt is lax about service and you must ask for bag check or iron. Check your room at check in and ask for another if something is wrong. Room cleaning service was honest and efficient. Most guests are tourists there for the price. Some of the guests are crashing 20 somethings or flopping lower class.Access to public transport is great and right in the middle of many areas. Right off market so Muni/Bart is easy to get to for uptown/city excursion, mission/castro(walk to grocery store, window shopping/eateries on market, castro), soma (walk to car rental, costco, folsom area). Coin laundry is across the street.San Francisco has a homeless issue and your best bet is to ignore them or say no thank you."

We did not expect the Hilton but we sure didn't expect this. We booked two rooms for three nights and the comments apply to both.The room was old, well worn carpet and furniture that appeared filthy in the poor lighting. The bathroom was moldy in the shower, around the ceiling and on the floor. There was no toilet paper holder in the bathroom and when we complained they said it would be done the next day (wrong). I went to the office which was under renovation to borrow a screwdriver to do my own repair in the room and was directed to the maintenance man in the breakfast room. He was sitting at a table with his feet on the table drinking a beer but did manage to find a screwdriver. Needless to say we didn't eat the complimentary breakfast in that room.The bed was clean and comfortable, but that is the extent of the good comments.Parking was another problem and we ended up parking off the premises around the corner at a restaurant as the lot was continually full.We found another hotel and booked out early as we just couldn't manage to stay any longer."

The motel is located in that part off Lombard St. directly near Presidio with only a little traffic compared with the more troubled part a few hundred feet away. Our room was clean, not small but also not very spacious. Usually every room has an own parking lot. But not in this motel. There are less parking lots than rooms in the inner courtyard. Breakfast in the very small lobby was more than poor. Only coffee, cereals, and some kind of sweet soft cookies. The only change to eat or drink something was to put the whole stuff on a tray and took it with you to your room.Our son had a small infection at one eye so we had to go to a doctor. The staff at the reception was very courteous and did everything to help us.Conclusion: Despite of some lack the motel is a good location for exploring SF.

Within walking distance of the marina (view of golden gate) then just up a scenic walk to fishermans wharf. If you walk straight up lombardo (and I mean up) you can access the crookedest street. One night we took a cab from fishermans wharf (too much happy hour) and it was only 8.00! Our room was old, bed linens were comfortable but exceptionally clean. New AC/heating had just been installed. Bathroom fan was extremely noisy so we just used the heating light most of the time. Not enough vanity space so I utilized the coffee area for hair/make up. People at the desk were extremely helpful. Continental breakfast was packaged rolls, cereal, milk, juice and coffee. Low water pressure, lots of hot water. Area felt safe even at night. Got a great package deal via travelocity. Well what can I say-definitely not a ritz carlton but I am sure it saved us a lot in transportation.

"Review_12908","hotel_156","hotel_7696","Jun 5, 2008","Nice enough for SF. We needed a place for the whole family for graduation. Since living in SF for 3 years, we knew how difficult it would be to place the whole family and make sure there were things to do in a relatively safe neighborhood. We picked the Presidio area because there was the Exploratorium and Golden Gate Bridge for the kids, Chestnut street for food, and the hotel had free parking. The price was decent for SF ~$100/nt. I booked 2 rooms off their website and 2 directly through the staff. Be cautious because if you book thru the website, you can't claim the AAA discount since they are sold thru a 3rd party. The first room we got was in the process of a remodel and smelled like heavy paint. They told us they weren't going to give us that room over the phone in the AM but stuck us with that room anyway...the bathroom was semi-moldy and not done yet. After the first night, we asked and finally got a completed remodeled room which was very nice and comfortable. (2nd floor middle corner room). They have free parking, but only a limited number of spaces so you had to stake your claim early. Breakfast was nothing special, cold cereal, OJ, coffee, cocoa, danishes. At least it was free. I thought the area was safe since it was off the Lombard main drag, but apparently, the hotel was held up the second night we were there. Otherwise, it was very quiet, and comfortable (if you get the right room), but the staff needs to communicate better. A major plus...free wireless internet!"
"Review_12909","hotel_156","hotel_7663","Apr 15, 2008","Great location. Great price. Yes, it's a standard hotel. Yes, the rooms are small. But, at $79 with a RoomSaver coupon, it's a bargain. The huge kingsize bed was a luxury. The staff was very helpful. It's 300' from the East entrance to the Persido, so it's a short drive to Fisherman's Wharf or Golden Gate Park. Quiet Neighborhood. Limited parking, but if you're only going to be there one night, leave your car there and walk around the corner to the Baker Streret Bistro. The property is being constantly improved."
"Review_12910","hotel_156","hotel_2658","Mar 7, 2008","Good Value Lodging for San Francisco This Travelodge is located at the entrance to the Presidio, which used to be an Army Post and is now part of the US Park Service. It is very near to the Golden Gate Bridge and is convenient to the attractions in and around the Presidio and the 'Marina' area of San Francisco. The hotel itself looks to be a renovated motel, but it's located in an area off the busy portion of Lombard St. so it was fairly quiet. I spent 3 nights there and slept well each night. I would recommend the rooms toward the back of the complex. The room itself was nothing exceptional but everything was comfortable, clean and functional. The beds were very comfortable with attractive bedding, a microwave and refrigerator were provided and the room (#301) was a corner unit with windows on 3 sides. The bathroom was very small, similar to european B  B bathrooms with no tub just a shower, but everything was clean and in working order.The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, the housekeeping staff did a good job. A very skimpy continental breakfast is offered at the front desk; juice, coffee and some breakfast rolls which you have to eat in your room or elsewhere. There is no breakfast room but there are many great places to have breakfast.The location offers many unique eateries nearby, and Chestnut St. has a wide selection of cafes, coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants with every kind of dining and grocery stores selling exceptional produce. There are many boutiques and shopping establishments as well. The area had only 2 franchise restaurants that I saw, an IHOP and a Johnny Rockets, everything else is a one of a kind.Parking is available but limited onsite and an overflow lot is around the corner. Street parking and public parking is expensive if you're not from a big city with similar rates. I paid about $100 a night for the room a double/double but found a $74 rate from the Roomsaver magazine. I would not hesitate to stay here again."

While searching hotels that were below the allowed lodging allowance, the Hotel Union Square popped up. After checking out the website, it looked like a beautiful place so I decided to stay there. WOW! When I arrived, the front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly! They gave me a shopping map of Union Square and directions and recommendations for tons of stuff! The hotel room was beautiful--a little small but still very comfortable. The shower is fantastic and the little things just made my stay so much better! The bed and bed linens were so fabulous I didn't want to get out of bed! This is now one of my favorite hotels and I plan to stay here again for pleasure."

The staff, in particular, were very helpful and friendly, and we enjoyed the decor and lighting. The size of the room was fine, and the bathroom was super-clean and modern (no tub though). We joined their Personality Perks program and received free waters and candies every day, which was a nice plus. It was good for our 18 month old, as the bed was low to the floor--so no fears of her falling off from a high bed. The staff also gave us a list of family-friendly activities in San Fran when we checked in."

They offer complimentary wine in the evening and coffee/tea in the morning.There are rooms that aren't much bigger than the queen size bed that they contain. Other rooms are a good size. Front Desk staff ranges from snooty and indifferent to extremely friendly and helpful.One thing that took us by surprise is that most rooms do not have a dresser for your clothes. If you're there for a night or two it might not be a problem living out of your suitcase. But we were there for a week. We had to ask 3 times before we could get a dresser. Only some rooms have them.SInce it's on a main street there is noise which is to be expected. The dumpster being emptied at 2 AM was a bit much.Bottom line...there are so many good hotels in this area and price range that there are lots of other options. If we weren't locked in as part of a package, we would have left without unpacking."

We arrived after a long flight and found the reception staff very helpful. We were offered an inside or outside room - they explained that there was no difference in size but the outside room would have a better view but be nosier. We opted for the outside view despite the noise warning. The room was really hot when we walked in but we turned the ceiling fan on and opened the window and it soon cooled down. The room was clean and recently refurbished - there was a bed, 2 bedside cabinets a chest of drawers and a comfy chair. Although the room was not large there was plenty of room for us to have our cases on the floor and opened for the 4 nights as we did not use the built in wardrobe. The bathroom was clean and toiletries were provided each day. The room had a hairdryer and iron and ironing board as well. Although noisy at night we were not disturbed and we had the window open at night as well. The hotel provide free internet access at the computer in reception as well as free tea/coffee in the mornings and a wine reception each evening. The cable cars finished at midnight and started at 6am but didn't wake us up. The location of the hotel was convenient - we were close to Union Square and the shopping mall and even closer to the cable car turn around and the public buses. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

All I can say is the room is about the same size as a jail cell or perhaps better yet a closet... It was sooo small that my luggage wouldn鈥檛 fit around the sides of the bed. To make matters worse - there was no air ventilation in this room, it felt like a 鈥渟auna鈥? The room did have a ceiling fan but it just filtered around the same hot stagnant air. Sadly the one window in the room was painted shut so you couldn鈥檛 even open it to get some air.We decided this was unacceptable鈥?So we went back down to the front desk to ask if there were any rooms available for the same price that either had ac and/or a window that opened. Of course, that answer was no. But if we wanted we could upgrade to an 鈥淓xecutive鈥?room - the room would be bigger  you could open up the window but this room would be more money. Ok we decided to take this bigger room.Ok after all that was taken care of things were better. Hotel Union Square is right in the middle of everything with HM next door and DSW Shoe Warehouse across the street. Its definitely a shoppers paradise! Now with that being said, it is a very noisy area.. We had a street side room so we heard the trolley cars/street noise at night which didn鈥檛 bother me but if you are a light sleeper this may not be for you.The hotel itself has been recently beautifully renovated鈥?new paint, new carpet, art deco like, very nice, very clean.

Please see either of them if you need advice.This is a 3 star hotel so thats what I gave them. Overall, I think this is a nice place to stay... But I do think they could avoid some bad reviews if they were more truthful about the petite room on their website (the picture onsite is misleading).. How that tiny, no air room appears on the website vs. how it really is in person are 2 different things."

The staff shared the many wonderful things to do on a beautiful San Francisco day. While this was our first stay at the Hotel Union Square, it definitely will not be the last. All of the hard work with the hotel remodeling certainly paid off. We love the effect of the zebra lights in the halls. It is very old and so beautiful. We loved hearing the cable cars."
"Review_12927","hotel_157","hotel_10204","Sep 16, 2008","Crappy, but tolerable My problems with this place are mainly that it was old and the rooms were tiny. Even though we did not have a room facing the street, it was very loud at night.Common areas: They smelled kinda foul, like the carpets needed cleaning. The morning coffee was icky.The room: It was very tiny - imagine a 10 ft. by 10 ft. box furnished with small Ikea furniture. The bed was a full or smaller, not a queen. There was barely any place for our luggage which only consisted of several backpacks. There was a fan and radiator, but no way of turning on the heat. At times we were cold. The bed linens were pilled (supposedly they were 600 thread count, but they couldn't have been all cotton). The duvet was like a white trash bag filled with feathers.The bathroom: The bathroom was also tiny. The sink was so small that it was difficult to wash your hands without getting water on your pants. The toilet made loud, scary noises after flushing. The shower was pretty small. The walls were a little crooked too.The upsides: Nothing appeared to be dirty. There was free Internet, TV, and a wine reception. The Internet was painfully slow, but the wine and hotel staff weren't bad.So overall, this is a budget hotel. I am sure many other downtown places have similar problems."

Website photo's looked fairly good etc so decided to book. We arrived late(about 2200 hours) due to the car breaking down having driven from Las Vegas in 1 hit. So as you can imagine very tired. Were were advised the price quoted by the Travel Agent was incorrect  that the actual price would $269 plux tax per night. I complained but they would not relent. Therefore given the time of day we had no choice but to stay. The receptionist did say they would upgrade us to a suite the following day as a favourThe room on the 1st night was a shoe-box (room 409), very claustraphobic and boiling hot, totally unacceptable.We were moved to a suite the following day which was significantly larger. The bad points: poor lighting, room not adequately serviced (not vacuumed, no toiletries left after the 1st day,very small 1/2 wardrobe). The rooms have recently been renovated but not very well  it looks like a bit of a rush job.Hotel attempted to charge for Valet parking on 2nd night but after I advised them I had taken the car back the previous day they amended the account,When asked upon leaving if our stay was satisfactory I advised them it was not, however no explanations were offered and certainly no refunds.I blame myself for not booking before we left as all the other hotels were fantastic  highly rated by other TA members."

I emailed the manager who advised me of this. This did cause me grief later on in las vegas, I assumed $$$ would be held as a deposit or so but not in the region of $200 for 2 nights, that is totally ridiculous.my gripe in summary, room unbelievably warm and unacceptable, customer service appaling at check-in, check-out and via the manager himself. just poor and has left a sour taste in my mouth from a great stay in this city.try another hotel if you want a good nights sleep  no hassles from an inept manager  his reception team"

The lobby is nice enough and everyone seemed friendly. Once I walked into my room I noticed that it was like a SAUNA!!!! I cannot emphasize this enough, I was drenched in sweat. There was an air conditoner cranked but it was not doing anything. I thought that it must just be the fact the AC hadn't had time to cool things off so my girlfriend and I went out for dinner. We came back 2 hours later and no change. I spoke with the front desk about the issue and their response was that they were full, would not give me a refund (I wanted to leave and go to another hotel) and that it was because my room was beside the boiler.Think of how absurd this is, this is a known issue, I paid nearly $200 for this room and this was the response I received.I cannot tell you strongly enough, do not stay here. We checked out at 7 am the next morning and would never go back.Again, think of how absurd my experience was, before you even think of booking here."

There was also a flat screen TV and an iPod dock with speakers. The bathroom was just large enough. We stayed on the 2nd floor facing the inside of the hotel and we never heard anything going on in Union Square. We couldn't even hear the trolleys. However, the walls between the rooms are too thin. We could hear EVERYTHING going on next door to us. I think that our neighbors bed was placed right behind our bed.

"Review_12945","hotel_157","hotel_8557","Apr 14, 2008","Great Location/Value My fiance and I stayed over the unseasonably hot April 12-13 weekend. It was my third time staying at the hotel in 8 years; the first time for him. I would never stay anywhere else in San Francisco (unless it's really hot- no air conditioning in this hotel because of the age of the building... usually not a problem given SF's climate). I am surprised by the negative reviews of this place. People, do your homework. If you are staying in a historical building built in the early 1900s, the rooms are going to be smaller and if you ask for a room on the street, of course it's going to be noisy. Isn't that the point of staying in the heart of the city, near Union Square? I love being in a small, boutique hotel, hearing the sounds of the city. If you don't, don't stay here. Simple as that. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We got great directions and advice. Loved the 5-6 free wine hour in the renovated and very metropolitan-chic lobby. Our room was the smallest I have had so far, with a tiny closet, small bathroom, and small room, but great new colors and decoration. Plus, what the heck do you need space for other than to sleep and then get ready to go out and see the city? The hotel is located just two blocks from the Union Square Bart station (very easy access from SFO- it was $10.70 for the two of us to get from the airport to the hotel), one block from the cable car turnaround at the end of Powell Street, one block from Union Square, and just two doors down from the Powell Street HM store (perfect for picking up last minute hats, accessories, etc.). Easy five minute walk to Chinatown (if you use Grant Street- it's flatter). Love the vibe of the area, not prissy, just relaxed and urban. Delicious Thai noodle house around the corner. We paid just over $100 for a Saturday night. Great location, great value, great vacation. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to explore the city (rather than sit inside and demand room service). Happy travels!!"
"Review_12946","hotel_157","hotel_8388","Apr 9, 2008","Really good experience We weren't sure what to expect as this was our first time in San Francisco. The hotel lobby doesn't look a lot like the website picture (a lot smaller than it appeared) so our first impressions were a little disappointing. However it got better from then on. Our room on the 5th floor was plenty big enough for 4 of us (but again we're used to British and European rooms which are generally smaller than in the US) and recently renovated - a modern look with stripped brick, flat screen TV etc. The bathroom was a little pokey but perfectly adequate. This is an old building so it's going to be a bit dark but they're doing a good job of remodelling. NB at the time of our stay this renovation was still unfinished and 2 floors were a building site; we didn't find this too intrusive but some might. It also made keeping the dust down a nightmare for the cleaners.Position-wise we loved being right in the heart of town. It was a bit noisy but what do you expect in the centre of a buzzing city like San Francisco? If you want a quiet retreat this isn't for you. It's right next to the Powell cable car turn-around and ideal for restaurants and shopping around Union Square, as well as museums such as SFMOMA and the Cartoon Museum. The staff were attentive, Tom the concierge was particularly helpful and the room was always clean. Negatives? The room had precious little clothes storage space for a family of 4 - it just needed a chest of drawers (which there was plenty of room for). We've mentioned this to the hotel and they've assured us this will be acted upon - only time will tell. Overall, though, I'd definitely recommend this hotel if you want to be in the heart of the city. We were very relieved to be staying here rather than, say, Fisherman's Wharf, which is tourist hell (and that's with 2 children - they loved their stay here); for it's location it's brilliant value."

The d茅cor (at the time) was beautiful and inviting. The service was impeccable and all the staff were very helpful. This hotel is in a prime location, with literally everything at your fingertips. We have already planned and booked our next trip for this year鈥檚 Pride stay at Hotel Union Square and are excited to know that we can expect a newly renovated and modernized hotel. I would recommend this hotel to ALL of my friends and then some 飦?Thank you staff of Hotel Union Square!"

Its like a totally different hotel,,,, Only booked this hotel as it was the only one left available the weekend we were there now I can see why. Our room was tiny and a very odd long shape. Not much air got into the room so it was very hot and that was September cant imagine how you would survive during the summer months with only a fan.... Unless you dont mind the heat you will end up melting in your room..... Great location for all the shops and malls the hotel is literally surrounded by them. Weather was really nice during the day but got very chilly at night so beware.. There was also a lot of homeless people on the streets but once you told them no or gave them some change they didnt bother you at all. Even with all the homeless about it still felt really safe. Pier 39 is only a short taxi ride away and worth the trip also did Alcatraz which was amazing."

"Review_12950","hotel_157","hotel_1771","Mar 4, 2008","Worked well for me I needed a hotel close to the Moscone Convention Center. When this popped up in a search, at about half the price of most of the surrounding facilities, I was intrigued and a little bit leary. The reviews here and elsewhere didn't really calm my fears. But, for three nights and with few other options within a reasonable budget, I decided to take a chance.When I was there, only a couple of floors had rooms open while renovations continue on the upper floors. My room on the second floor was small by contemporary American standards (and included only a small nightstand and an empty armoire with just enough space to walk around the bed). But this is, after all, a very old building and the space was fine for one or two people if you're not spending a lot of time in the room (and why would you in San Francisco?). I've seen similarly sized rooms in older hotels in NYC and European cities, so I guess size perception is a matter of location and expectations. And some of the rooms are larger (a colleague who traveled with me had much more space).The bathroom was about average size and the closet was actually somewhat spacious, although there was no dresser or drawers in the armoire so I wound up leaving some of my clothes in my suitcase on the rack in the closet. Again, it was okay by myself but would have been an irritant if my wife had been traveling with me.My room was not overlooking the street, which may explain why it was relatively quiet at night. Morning was another story...renovation work began about 7 a.m. most mornings, lots of banging. On a work trip, I was up anyway. If I'd been on vacation, I probably would have been out of there after the first night.The staff was very friendly, and helpful with the couple of small questions I asked.All in all, a mixed bag right now. Whether it would be a reasonably comfortable bargain in an otherwise expensive market (my experience) or a nightmare would depend on your needs and expectations."

For $160 we were packed into a room the size of a broom closet facing the street. The cable car and street sounds are very disruptive and when they do quiet down you have the plumbing from the hotel groaning and moaning all through the night. To make matters worse they were doing some construction on the top floor. They didn't tell us this when we booked in.Also when I was leaving I did a quick sweep of the room to see if I'd left anything behind and found a dirty pair of underpants from a pervious guest! Not good. When I told the zonked out receptionist he simply drawled That's unusual Ma'am . It is a hotel that lacks comfort, character and class. And for a city with so much to offer I suggest you look elsewhere. There are so many good places for the same money. We just lucked out."

We stayed there because we thought we could walk to our conference site and the hotel did have an outdoor parking lot right behind the hotel. However, the room was very small and did not appear like the web page photos, not even close. Although the room was fairly clean, there was no clock and there was no phone map to show which button takes you where. My friend's room down the hall had no window at all and her phone did not work at all so she had to change rooms. We both decided we would not stay there again for the price and the unrealistic advertising. The front desk staff were nice but the hotel is dingy and has a lot of thing wrong with it, things broken, chipped tile, cigarette butts thrown outside the window and lying on the roof etc. etc. Did not make me feel relaxed or rested. Just wanted to leave asap."

Website shows lovely Boutique style rooms, well, they're obviously not all renovated yet! Even in reception there are pictures up of nice rooms, you're lucky if you get one though. Our party occupied 2 rooms, both were small and nothing like the pictures. Our bathroom was dingey to say the least, fittings were rusty, bath grubby, cracked tiles, most of it bodged together with filler and very outdated. Got the feeling the whole placed needed a good clean. It all stinks of stale food too, think this might be to do with the noodle house next door. On the positive side, staff very friendly and location perfect for shopping and dining without the need for taxis. Complimentary tea/coffee/hot choc in the mornings and wine for an hour in the evenings was welcome and a nice touch too. Think I'd stay somewhere else when returning to San Francisco unless they refit the rooms or they can guarantee me one of the rooms already renovated!"

When we arrived we were given room 210. This was quite a big room and seemed quite and well appointed. Unfortunately it was not ready / clean and the cleaning staff had gone for the day. When we were taken to our new room it was terrible. Tiny, noisy. Truly awful. We went back downstairs to try to understand what was going on and were told that room 210 was an upgrade, but since it was not ready 220 was the only other room available. We would have made up the nice room ourselves but there weren鈥檛 even sheets on the bed. Needless to say we were very upset. We reserved over a month ago and could not understand how we were stuck with such a poor room. It鈥檚 clear from the first room we saw and other reviews posted that if you get a decent room you鈥檒l enjoy your stay, but if luck is not on your side you鈥檒l regret every minute your in the hotel room. Unfortunately there are far too many bad rooms (and they really are awful) and far too little control over which one you get to recommend this hotel. Besides, there are many other hotels just as well located that are in the price range and much nicer so why stay here?"

"Review_12960","hotel_158","hotel_5675","Dec 1, 2008","Superb location I have stayed at the Villa Florence twice now with about a ten year gap between my stays. The location cannot be beat. The nice thing is you can book an inside room so you can actually sleep away from the hustle and bustle of Powell Street, and yet you can step outside of the lobby right next to a lively corner of Union Square. Check in was quick and efficient; we were able to get into our room at 11:15. We had a junior suite which was spacious. The bathrooms aren't that large, but it is an older building. The amenities were all updated. There was a nicely stocked mini bar. The bath products were nice, and there was great water pressure in the shower. The room was clean and reminiscent of an Italian villa. The lobby had nice seating areas. Besides having Kuleto's, a full restaurant, there is Bar Norcini which serves wine, panini, pastries, and coffee. Check out was also smooth. The only delay we had was the retrieval of our car from valet parking because the lot is offsite. I will definitely be back to the Villa Florence."

When I arrived, there were complimentary treats in my room with a welcome note. That was a real classy touch.

"Review_12964","hotel_158","hotel_6321","Sep 28, 2008","Villa Florence was great! My husband and I just returned from a short getaway trip to San Francisco. I booked our stay through Expedia and chose Villa Florence for its location and its pet policy (no added fee!), since our Jack Russell terrier accompanied us on our trip. The hotel let us check into our room early (check-in is at 3 pm), even though I only called them 30 minutes before we arrived. They also honored my request for a quiet, pet-friendly room at the last minute when I wrongfully assumed that Expedia would pass on our special requests. We were warmly welcomed by the staff, and our anxious dog, who is not exactly a city dog and was overwhelmed with all the hustle and bustle, was met with smiles and welcome petting. (Every time we went in and out of the hotel, we, including our dog, were greeted warmly by the staff.) Our standard king room was not exactly gigantic, but large enough for us and was well-decorated and clean. The bathroom is small but quite functional and had great products from Lather. My husband was happy to see the large flat screen tv and the ipod ready sound system in the room. The linens on the bed were soft and the feather bed quite comfortable. The room itself was an interior room with no view, which was good for us since it got quite noisy at night from the busy streets below. On Friday night, we heard the faint thumping bass from a nearby club but not so loud that we couldn't sleep. We had breakfast at the attached restaurant, Kuleto's, on our final day, and it was reasonably priced (compared to everything else in San Francisco) and very tasty. The cable cars run right in front of the hotel on Powell Street and the Bart/Muni station is just 2 blocks down, so transportation was no problem at all. The only negative I would say about our stay was the lack of nearby parks to take our dog. Union Square, even with its grassy area, wasn't exactly an ideal place for our dog. Overall, I would recommend Villa Florence for its friendly service, clean and comfortable accomodations and its proximity to everything. We had a great time!"

As stated we stayed at the hotel on our honeymoon, and when we returned to the hotel the first night we had recieved a bottle of wine from the hotel. A very lovely gesture.We make it a habit to tip houskeeping every day to ensure the person who cleans our room that day gets her share of the tip, apparantley we had the same lady clean our room every day, and every day when we came back to the hotel she had left us a little note thanking us for being so kind to her and wishing us a great day etc, a very nice touch we felt.Our room was large, as was the bathroom.

I booked thru Hotels.com after narrowing my search to 10 hotels near Union Square. The hotel is almost done w/ a season long remodel job. It was a pleasant surprise immediately. The staff was accomodating, helpful and extremely polite. Our room was a King-Studio and was spotless and nicely decorated. We were in room #522 which was inside and extremely quiet. The location is perfect for downtown shopping, visits to China town, and an enjoyable up  down walk to the wharf. We will recommend this hotel to all friends and family. We ate at the restaurant connected to hotel, Kulettos, and had an exquisitely tasty lunch! We walked just around the corner to the landmark Lefty O'Douls for breakfast. What an affordable treat! And one more thing. . . .the bedding was super comfortable too! I think it was a feather top mattress and ensured a great night's sleep. We will be back for the Christmas holidays!"
"Review_12969","hotel_158","hotel_7539","Jul 2, 2008","A Gem If You Book the Right Room Pros: Great location- 1/2 block from Union Square. Pet-friendly(limited to 2nd floor rooms). Very accommodating and knowledgeable staff. By the second day they were greeting us by name. Free wi-fi access. Excellent rates. Very comfortable beds. Very clean. Marvelous in-house restaurant(Kuletos) open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a delightful bar/restaurant in the lobby where you can eat delicious home-made panini sandwiches,salads, great salami and cheeses. Cons: You have to book the right room or you won't be able to sleep without earplugs. Our room faced O'Farrell, across the street from a bar, and the nighttime noise was deafening until 3am.Other rooms face Powell, and again the cable car noise is annoying. The website says the windows are sound-proof. Ours was definitely not. Our room, a standard Queen, was tiny. It felt like 150 sq. feet. There was no chair to read in and the bed took up most of the room. They offered to move us, but we just didn't want to bother with repacking  unpacking. Summary: This is one hotel where I would definitely advise booking directly by phone with the front desk to make sure you get a room (ie not facing Powell or O'Farrell) that is noise-free, and that is a decent size (the ones with sitting areas are nice). They also have good package deals which include parking ($40 a night otherwise) and a continental breakfast."

I booked a family room for the 4 of us (two young teenagers) and we expected to be squashed as I had read all the other reviews about the room size being small, but seeing as though it was only for 4 nights and the price was good I thought we'd take a chance. We arrived from Vegas very late at night and were delighted that not only had our room been held for us (as requested ) but that we were upgraded to a family suite. The room we found to be delightful, (no view but who cares when you are out all day),quiet, clean  bright.The kingsized bed and sofa-bed was more than adequate, though if my children had been any older I don't think we could have managed. The bathroom was a bit small, but I am being picky. The reception staff were more than helpful  wine tasting at 5pm a real bonus. We didn't try the 'in-house' restaurant as, after 3 weeks in the States, we found it a bit pricey but there are plenty of other restaurants in the vacinity to suit your budget. The location is superb, out of the door and on to Union square, right on the cable car line. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone."
"Review_12973","hotel_158","hotel_6338","May 28, 2008","Not remodeled yet Their website lets you believe that the hotel has finished being remodeled, this is not the case. The entire front area and lobby is under construction with scaffolding everywhere. The rooms we decent and clean but I could not tell if they were remodeled either as the carpet looked a little old. The room was actually a descent size and it had very comfy beds. My only complaint about it was that we had a room facing Powell St and it was really noisy. Luckily, we are pretty heavy sleepers but I could imagine that the noise could keep someone up at night. You hear everything going on, on the street including cable cars, people talking and traffic. I think the hotel has some good potential once it is completely finished. We didn鈥檛 eat at the restaurant there but it was always busy and the food looked good. Before we went out at night we started off at the bar at Kuletto's for a glass of wine or a martini. The bar tender there was really friendly and gave us some good recommendations on places to eat. I would stay here again since the price was good for the area but will wait until they are finished with construction."
"Review_12974","hotel_158","hotel_7941","Apr 22, 2008","Under Construction This hotel is UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Contrary to the management's insistence, this fact is NOT made clear on the website (which says that the hotel is open during it's transformation). The entire front of the building is covered in scaffolding, and the lobby is a construction zone. Otherwise, the service was fine, but our closet door was completely broken and the heating unit did not work. If you want to be in the middle of Union Square, it's a good location. But I would not reccommend this hotel, because it is dishonest not to dsiclose to customers that the place is under construction, and you can book a room for the same price or better in a comporable hotel (NOT under construction) nearby."

The front desk staff were unhelpfull and we had to lug all our bags into the lobby and up to the room with no offer of assistance etc. The room was supposed to be a twin and/or double for the two of us. I actually went back to the reception after checking the room because I believed they had incorrectly given us a single room. Front desk assured me the room was a double and that nothing could be done as the hotel was fully booked! The bed was at best a 3/4 single, the TV didn't work, and there was not enough space in the room with our our 2 suitcases, 1 ski bag and a boot bag to open the door let alone relax and unwind.Construction was going on on the floor above us and the noise was constant.

My corporate travel came up with this hotel and frankly based on the rate I was a little worried. But the experience was entirely positive and my worries were unfounded. Also I saw they have AARP and AAA rates that equaled my low corporate rate. At just over $100 a night in down-town SF!!! This is a great deal!Front desk service was fine. I checked in and out and checked my bag twice with no issue. The property was well maintained and clean. It is an older property so the elevators are smaller and the rooms have high ceilings and are clearly older, but with charm and no problems. It reminded very much of a room my wife and I stayed in, in the SF St. Francis (Westin property) old part of the hotel, which is 1/2 block away and a well known property for two or three times the rate. The windows looked into a breezeway, so there was no view but it was quiet and light.The room was a very good size for a queen bed, had a desk, and the bathroom was small but fine. There was even an umbrella in the closet along with the iron and ironing board. The hotel wireless internet worked fine and I think it came included with the room.When you're in SF you should be out doing things and this is a great hotel if you are doing just that and want something comfortable and cozy to come home to at the end of the day."

My reservation room request was not honored even though I confirmed with the hotel several days before arrival. The gentleman handling check-in on Friday night was extremely rude and didn't care that the 2 bed room I requested was unavailable. He blamed the error on the fact that they were overbooked and under going renovations. He also offered no solution. There was no manager on duty, but he assured me the manager would contact me the next day. The manager was never around all weekend.The room looked old and had peeling wallpaper. The water did not get hot and the phone did not work. The bed was very comfortable and the room did look clean. The location is amazing! It is in Union Square and in easy walking distance to all shopping and Chinatown. It is 2 blocks away from the Powell Street BART station, which easily connects you to the rest of SF, the Bay Area, and SFO Airport.With regard to the construction, it is not mentioned on their website and it is very disruptive. Extremely loud construction was taking place on 3 floors at such hours as 10pm on Friday evening and 9am on Sunday morning. I contacted the front desk about the loud noises and they promised to talk to the construction workers, but it didn't stop.I would recommend avoiding this hotel until at least after construction is finished (Summer 2008)!"

"Review_12983","hotel_158","hotel_8212","Jan 13, 2008","Great Price, Great Location! If you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a terrific location, Villa Florence is the hotel for you while visiting the wonderful city of San Francisco. It's located in Union Square, is on the cable car line, and is only a few blocks from the BART station. We took the BART to Montgomery Station with all our luggage. Villa Florence was only a few blocks up, so it was perfect! The lobby was both beautiful and welcoming. Our room was a king studio. It was spacious for a city hotel, and the bathroom was recently renovated. Everything was clean and looked nice. Our window faced the main street with the cable car line, and we did not find it overly noisy. The location was phenomenal! We were within walking distance to great shopping, awesome restaurants, and neat nightlife. The cable car station was one block away from the hotel. If it's a nice day, you could wait in line to watch the spinning of the cars. If not, here's a trick - go up a few blocks from the hotel and wait on the corner. The street cars do not fill up at the station area so that they can pick up other riders up the line. This can save you quite a bit of time - I believe we waited over 45 minutes to board. The hotel offers complimentary coffee and tea each morning. Even better, they have a small bakery/cafe, Cafe Kuleto's, that is attached to their lobby. It was fabulous and well-priced. You don't even have to leave the hotel! The hotel also has an awesome restaurant, Kuleto's, that offers incredible italian cuisine, but is a bit pricey. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Villa Florence. Out of all the other Union Square hotel options, this one was nearly $100 cheaper per night. It was definitely a hotel we'd stay at again and we will definitely recommend it to our friends and family. For the location, it cannot be beat!"

It starts at 10:30am, though we were in the lobby at 9:30am and got on when they brought back some passengers who just got off the Sapphire!We wished we would have had more time to explore the area around the hotel but went to Disneyland on our free day before the cruise so did not have time. Head south along the channel and there are a lot of restaurants, we did not know about them until we saw them during sailaway!One thing that bothered us was that we confirmed via phone and email prior to our stay that their restaurant would be open normal hours on Thanksgiving. But when we arrived there was a notice it was closed at 3pm. They did have room service which was ok, not great. But there are a lot of extra charges for room service.Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again when sailing from San Pedro."

Easy walking distance to the waterfront with many restaurants and sights/museums close by. A very helpful concierge. Spotless room. My only complaint: we paid for the upgrade to the executive lounge floor - the website said it was 24 hour access to floor lounge... breakfast, hors douevres served daily. This is not the case - the lounge is open 6 - 10 AM then locked tight until the afternoon happy hour (4 - 8 PM I think it was) Mon - Fri only. So, no breakfast there the Saturday we were there (they did give me breakfast coupons when I went down that AM to complain) and no availability to access the lounge outside of these very restrictive hours - definitely NOT worth the extra money. I would have been very content with the lesser priced rooms as this upgrade feature was of little value. Still, the hotel is very clean with pleasant personnel and easy walking to sights. We would definitely stay here again if cruising from this port but would only reserve the standard room."

"Review_12988","hotel_159","hotel_10327","Nov 23, 2008","Convenient, but maybe over priced The location for this hotel is great, right by the cruise terminal. Literally a 3-5 minute shuttle ride if that. You could walk it if you had to. There are some restaurants and bars in the area, but nothing too exciting. It is the LA Harbor after all, which is fairly industrial.We booked an Executive Suite with King Bed. It has a separate living area with pull out sofa. The total was $243 USD after all the taxes. I think just a normal room would have run us about $190 USD, and the extra space as good since other friends of ours were staying in the hotel and could come and visit as we waited in the morning to head over to our ship.The bed was comfortable, as all Crowne Plaza beds seem to be.But to be honest, I think it is a bit overpriced. I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I can get a room for $100-125 USD."

"Review_12991","hotel_159","hotel_9529","Jun 20, 2008","If You Have A Problem Here, DON'T Bother Asking For Help If you are so excited about your upcoming cruise that all you need is a bed and working bathroom, you'll likely enjoy this place. If you travel regularly and are used to an efficient front desk staff - promptly greeting you and placing your (working) room key in your hand within 2 minutes of your arrival, bring a folding chair (or cot) as you are likely to find yourself wishing you'd made your reservation ANYWHERE else.Unfortunately, mostly as a result of multiple Priceline reservations, I have stayed at this hotel on multiple occassions and have learned that competent service only occurs by accident. I have asked several front desk staffers what they think the hotel guest expects and NONE of them could offer any response to indicate they know we (guests) are only seeking to get from Point A (the reception desk) to Point B (a room with clean sheets a working bathroom and HBO) as QUICKLY as possible. I have received the wrong room key (someone was already checked in) on two occassions and, one evening I was fortunate enough to return to the front desk twice (with luggage in hand) twice in the SAME night because I was given non-working keys.The last time I checked in, another guest was seeking a working key for his room because his original key didn't work.Before I was checked in, I had to call the Holiday Inn 800# and Priceline customer service. Although I was able to show a confirmed and pre-paid Priceline reservation (complete with printed receipt and confirmation number, the two front desk clerks were unable to provide a room because they claimed The hotel hadn't been paid for my reservation. It took almost three (yes, 3) hours to check me in. (I was told one of the clerks was fired the next day but the problem clearly rests with the franchise owner and the manager.) The manager was unwilling to speak with me when I wanted to discuss the situation the next day. The hotel reluctantly offered me 30,000 points on the Priority rewards program - an amount which barely covers one night at ANOTHER Crown Plaza. It has now been several months since my last (and I hope LAST) stay and they still have not placed the points in my account.The incompetence is consistant - from upper management to the front desk. Enjoy your experience - and the inevitible surprises!!!"
"Review_12992","hotel_159","hotel_8570","Jun 14, 2008","Restaurant is strictly ' Halal ', religion specific My husband and I booked a room at this hotel on Hotwire, for one night prior to our departure on a cruise. It was an average hotel as far as bed, friendliness, location and all that but a few things in their dining room made it a little disappointing to us. For one, it was not disclosed on any hotel description that the hotel restaurant was 'halal', meaning that it only served food permissable under Islamic law. The food offered was more tailored to those that are familiar with Middle Eastern dishes. Beef bacon at their breakfast buffet instead of the pork bacon we are used to, was not a very tasty substitute, in our opinion. The restaurant does make a good hamburger, so if you are there for lunch this is recommended. Gnats flying all around the dining room, however, helped ruin our dining experience regardless of the restaurant's food quality. If you decide to book a room, here, order delivery from 'Buono's Authentic Pizzeria', instead of dining downstairs. The pizza was delicious and no gnats !"
"Review_12993","hotel_159","hotel_8728","May 11, 2008","Mostly pleased with the Crowne Plaza I booked the Crowne Plaza as a pre-cruise hotel that is very close to the LA Harbor where Royal Caribbean ships are berthed. I won the hotel with a $65 bid on Priceline, which seems to be a standard winning price at this property. I called a week ahead of time to see about requesting a room with two beds as I was traveling with my mother, and was told by the reservations person at the hotel that I had a king room and that if I didn't like it, I'd have to take it up with Priceline. Im used to being denied this type of request befroe check-in, but the usual response is that a note will be made on the reservation in case a desired room was available. Not so here, and I felt it was handled a little poorly, but figured I might have better luck upon check-in.We caught an early, direct flight out of Indianapolis to LAX, and with the time change, we actually arrived at 8:30 AM. I had arranged a SuperShuttle to take us to the hotel ($17/pp), and we were dropped off around 10 AM. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and not only gave use a room with two beds, but also let us check in 5 hours early. I appreciated this, and we headed up to our room on the fifth floor. As per usual with a Priceline room, it was located at the end of the hall, but for the savings and the quietness that provides ... who cares? The room itself was very clean, though missing a few things (some of the sleep ammenities promised, a second coffee mug, etc), but we got these from a housekeeper we saw around. I was disappointed though that the wireless internet service was down and that the TV was getting horrible reception. The internet eventually started working ($10/day) and I figured out that I could get a good TV signal if I twisted the cord in back until it came through clearly. We ate lunch at the hotel restaurant and it was fine, though the food was nothing great and the service was pretty slow. The pool is a small outside one, along with a hot tub, and the exercise room consists of a treadmill, an elliptical, a few recumbent bikes, and various weight machines. I was slightly perturbed by the fact that there were no cleaning supplies in they gym as they had obviously run out a while ago and simply had not been replaced.We decided to get out of the room and walk around San Pedro. It was a Sunday afternoon and was very quiet. You can tell there is some neighborhood rejuvenation going on because of all of the places being ripped up and turned into apartments and condos. Within a few blocks of the hotel in each direction it seemed like a nice area, and then after that, buildings started deteriorating. There was a grocery/liquor store east of the hotel a block or two, but it looked a little scary to me. There are also a lot of shops and restaurants the opposite direction along the harbor.Later in the day, we headed towards the harbor and ate at a Mexican restaurant called The Green Onion. Prices were decent and the food was very good, though my mom later thought that the food didn't agree with her. The next morning we went to the Pacific Cafe, across the street from the hotel (exiting through the restaurant door). This was a nice little place that was seemingly run by a single lady, and I was able to get a ham/cheese omelet with two slices of sourdough toast for $3.95. The food was quite decent and the price could not be beat ... I'd definitely recommend this place over a chain like Starbucks (which is just down the block on the same side of the street as the hotel).The Crowne Plaza offered a free shuttle to the port starting at 10:30. We went down at about 10:45, climbed aboard, and were the only ones taken over to the ship. This shuttle picks up from the port, and it will also take people to a local mall and supposedly other places within a 5-mile radius. I asked about being taken to an In-N-Out Burger and was told maybe later that really seemed to be a no even though it was 3 miles away.All-in-all, this was a good stay and I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again for a pre-cruise."

"Review_12995","hotel_159","hotel_3046","Apr 16, 2008","THE place to stay before cruise We were going on a 7 night cruise to Mexico from San Pedro and were driving from Northern California. We wanted a place to stay near the dock and that had some kind of parking and shuttle. It did not have to be fancy, but it had to be clean and comfortable and easy. This hotel fit the bill AND MORE.We seriously looked at the Vagabond up the hill from this place but it had mixed reviews and it only seemed to have one-way transport, and it looked less comfortable and in a so-so location. Vagabond was going to be $130 for one night and parking. Crowne Plaza was $189 for room, 2 drinks, full breakfast, indoor parking, and both way shuttle.The people were the friendliest we have seen at a hotel in a long time. They will either valet your car or you can self park in the garage. The shuttle driver, desk clerk and luggage handlers were all super friendly, considering they do a lot of schlepping of luggage with this many cruisers. I think the majority of their business is cruise related. They are ina better neighborhood in San Pedro, which seems to be getting a makeover.The room was very comfy, and they included a little bottle of lavendar room spray, sleep mask and a cd of soothing music. Nothing fancy but a real nice touch. Decor is new and modern with some nice maritime photos. Clean and fresh linens.We ordered room service at 10pm when we got in and it came real fast and was very good. With 2 kids we have gotten to be real experts on room service, and this was on par with the best we have had before. Breakfast was a full buffet with hot and cold food. You get two adult tickets with the $189 park and sail package. Apparently the 10th floor is a concierge floor that has a complimentary snacks and and meals, which is more common on higher-end chains than this one. They shuttled us to the cruise dock which is literaly about 5 blocks away and things went very smoothly on both ends of the cruise. I would definitely stay here again if I was in San Pedro, and this is a no-brainer for night before cruising."

The check-in process was quick and simple. The front staff wasn鈥檛 overly friendly; they could use a happy class. The hotel is beautiful, we were very impressed. The room was very nice as well. We had a double bed room that overlooked the pool. The room is decorated with warm colors and beautiful white linens. The bathroom had granite counter tops and was very clean. There was a small bag that contained ear plugs, eye mask and a nice lavender linen spray. The beds were very comfortable. My only complaint is our room was next to the elevator, and oh my it was so noisy. I turned on the air conditioner to mute the sound, and it worked okay. The next day we had no problem getting a free shuttle ride to the pier. It was overall a nice place to stay."

My husband had a stir fry entree that was quite good. I ordered a pepper soup which was good as well. If I go back, I would enjoy a meal there again if I stayed at the hotel because...if you are there for anything aother reason, there is NOTHING else to really do in San Pedro. My husband and I walked around the neighborhood in the morning. At times I was scared and would turn my rings around. Not sure if it was all that bad but I was not very comfortable.

"Review_12999","hotel_159","hotel_5543","Mar 3, 2008","Great pre-cruise stay in San Pedro We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night before a cruise on the Golden Princess in February. We flew in from the East Coast and arrived at the hotel about 9ish pm local time. We used Go Sedan for our transfers and they were wonderful. They met us in baggage claim and took us straight to the bellman at the hotel. Great service! Initially, we requested a non-smoking king room. When I called the day of check in to confirm, they had me down for a smoking double. I again requested non-smoking king. When we checked in, I asked again. They said they had non-smoking but no kings. Then the clerk offered a handicapped non-smoking king which we were happy to take. Check in was very quick and easy. We used Priceline for our room. The desk clerk wasn't super friendly, but was quick, efficient and friendly enough. We checked in at the bell desk and they recommeded some places to eat nearby and provided a map for us. We ended up at the Green Onion, a Mexican restaurant almost right next door. The food and service were great. It was casual and reasonably priced. Perfect for weary travelers! The decor was a little different - almost like a Bennigan's. They had a bar. Our hotel room had a big chair and a desk. We didn't have a great view. The room was very clean, but a little worn. The shower was a little dark with decent water pressure. The bed was very comfortable. The room temperature was good. They even provided a clip to place on the curtains to keep them closed and keep the room dark. My only complaint about the hotel would be the thin walls. There was a very loud, rude family next door to us making ton of noise at 6am. We could hear almost every word they were saying (more like shouting). But you can't really fault the hotel for the behavior of obnoxious people. We didn't call and complain because we were ready to get up anyway. The next morning we went for a walk up 6th street I think - headed away from the port. We walked for a few blocks. At one of the main intersections, caddy corner to a thift store, we found the funky little San Pedro Deli and Cafe. What a great place to eat breakfast. The menu was varied. The service and the food were awesome. It was a great way to start our vacation. Plus it was a great value for the money. They give you a ton of food. I had 4 slices of french toast, 2 eggs and bacon for $4.99. My husband had an omelette, fried potatoes and buscuits and gravy for $7.59. It was much cheaper that eating at the hotel, and it was nice to experience some local flavor. We also passed several other lunch/dinner restaurants as well as a local coffee shop and a Starbucks. We saw a sign for a liquor store, but it looked like it was closed down. We also saw a wine shop, but it wasn't open yet. I did not see a drug store near the hotel but we didn't ask about one either.The hotel had a gift shop, bar, restaurant, pool and hot tub that we did not use.When we checked in, we asked about the port shuttle and they gave us a paper with the information. They provide service to LA port in San Pedro and to Long Beach for Carnival Cruises. Check out was a breeze - we did express check out over the phone. We carried our own luggage down and were on the first shuttle at 10:30. There were only three of us on the shuttle. The ride was only 5-10 minutes tops. They also provide return shuttle service to the hotel, but we didn't use that service. All in all, it was a great place to stay before our cruise. I would highly recommended it for a pre-cruise stay because it is in a great location, the service was good, and the rooms were clean and comfortable."

The location was terrific for access to the pier, but I wasn't impressed with the hotel. The bell-girl was good and friendly, but the desk staff was totally disinterested in being friendly or conducting any conversation. She just wanted to check us in and get rid of us asap. Our first room was on the 7th floor; I think it was 729. The room was shabby; door frames were chipped and dirty, the furniture was also tired, but the beds were good. We put our luggage down, and then we headed out to see the area. Just before we left I looked into the shower, and it looked ok but then I noticed that there was mildew around the tub. My husband said it was fine, but I wasn't happy and thought about it all afternoon. Also, there was a note on the front desk saying that if you couldn't answer Very Satisfied on every item of the room survey you should let the know right away. When we got back from our day out I went to the desk and said that I certainly couldn't answer Very Satisfied, and I asked if all of the rooms were shabby and had mildew in the bathrooms. That clerk was helpful and was dismayed (??) to learn that the room wasn't good. He moved us to the 10th floor quickly. This room was much better although it didn't have as good a view of the ship coming in which was one of the reasons we booked the Crowne. The important part was that the tub area was spotless. The wood furniture and woodwork were still chipped and tired, but the whole room was more acceptable. Being on the 10th floor there was a reception room where they had afternoon snacks and continental breakfast which was very nice. That room also had a good view of the harbor so we could see the Diamond arriving. I'd recommend the hotel for a pre-cruise, but I wouldn't pick it for a vacation."

Our cabbie didn鈥檛 know where the hotel was, but since I had printed out our confirmation information, he was able to call and get the directions. (Moral of the story: always have a printed copy of your hotel reservation confirmation.) When we arrived at the hotel, bellmen took our many bags and followed us up to the rooms after check-in. 2 of our 3 rooms were upgraded to Executive Suite rooms, which was nice. The bedding was incredibly comfortable and the bathtub was huge. After a long day of traveling and the frustration of the ground transportation, DW definitely enjoyed the nice relaxing bath.The bellmen who assisted with checking-in had told us that the hotel鈥檚 shuttle service started at 10:30 in the morning, but if we wanted to be first out, to call for the bellmen about 10:00.

They also had shampoo and soap etc. The lighting in the room was more ambient than task though. I had to put my make-up on in the bathroom. No big deal though. The free shuttle to the port was very easy and convenient. We only had one small complaint which wasn't the hotel's fault. My husband wanted a snack when we arrived, but the little snack shop was closed when we got there. We were hoping to pick up a little something for breakfast there, but they only had a few snacks--no breakfast foods. It was more of a gift shop than a food store. Again, not a big deal. The restaurant was opened for breakfast but we didn't want to sit down, so we just ate when we got on the ship. I will definitely stay here again if sailing out of San Pedro."

Granted I payed $84 per night in SF, I may have got what I payed for and more...an itchy scalp and grossed out stories to tell my friends. Cons: The curtains, carpet, and bed sheets were draconian and filthy. There was hair on my bed sheets not belonging to me. It took me 2 hours to get my towels replaced and then after all the hassle, I was given 1 new small towel. The bathroom was outside for some rooms (prior to the renovation, guests shared bathrooms) and although I was told one of the outside bathroom was assigned to my room only, there was no outside lock meaning anyone can come and use the bathrooms and I couldn't keep my toiletry safe. At night, it was impossible to read due to the poor lighting. Plus up until about midnight, you could hear the restaurants downstair emptying their trash and glass bottles. Definitely bring your ear plugs for this one. Also no AC/fan, only a heater. So to get air into the stinky rooms, one have to open the windows and deal with the outside noise.Pros: Very few. The front desk staff was pretty nice. Most of the time they were running around dealing with problems. Also beware of late check in, as you'll have to call the emergency number to get someone to check you in."

Staff WAS friendly but the room was so small, smelly, noisy and it also came with a surprise underneath the bed. As we where packing up to go we found a condom wrapper, I felt so disgusted! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone!"

"Review_13018","hotel_160","hotel_8495","Jul 10, 2008","Central location, unreliable booking, friendly mgt. We booked two connected rooms with two double beds each with a shared bath. I spoke directly with someone at the hotel. It was difficult to communicate with the person at the hotel and I was concerned the reservation was not correct. When I called the hotel a week later, my fears were confirmed. They had the wrong number of rooms per night and the wrong room accommodations. It took two calls to correct the mistake. When we arrived in SF to check in, we found our reservation had been screwed up again. Instead of two rooms with two beds each (which evidently doesn't exist) we had on room with a private bath and one bed and one room with a double and singe bed and no private bath. Not only were the rooms not connected, but we didn't have enough room for everyone to sleep! We had to switch rooms different nights and never got the rooms we wanted. We listened as another group of 3 ladies went through the SAME PROCESS! BEWARE! I noticed others commented on this too....The rooms are tiny, but with tons of charm. The hotel was older and not the cleanest, but definitely acceptable. The staff was friendly and helpful. Despite all the confusion, I would probably stay here again. It was a fun experience and a GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD."
"Review_13019","hotel_160","hotel_5520","Jun 18, 2008","Great Location on a Budget I arrived in San Francisco on Saturday and found that the Edwardian is located on 1 of the main streets, making it convenient to the buslines and walking to many places. Right outside, you can catch the 71 bus and for $1.50 and 10-15 minutes of your time, be in the famed Haight/Ashbury neigborhood. Across the street is a coffee house with entertainment every night and great coffee/eats. The aroma of something delicious kept wafting into the building and I noticed there are some fairly swanky restaurants in the direct vicinity of the hotel. The Edwardian, itself, is clean and, from my experience, safe as you need a key to get in the front door. Some of the other hotels in this price range I researched had complaints about panhandlers and unsavory neighborhoods. That was not my experience at the Edwardian. I felt fairly safe coming in after midnight alone, though there is always a safety issue that late in a big city. I had a small, single room with private bath. Yes, it was not a large room, but I was only there to sleep/shower, and I was alone, so it wasn't like I needed much. Maid service came by everyday and changed linens/towels. The building itself was for the most part quiet. The 2nd floor offers a small reading room with comfy chairs, while the 1st floor (not the lobby) offers a pc with internet (somewhat pricey at 30 cents a minute, but OK if you are only checking email) and coffee/tea. The buildling is an older building, perhaps early 1910's-20's. The old elevator might not be completely handicap friendly as it has the iron gate that you have to pull open to get in an out of, but I found it to be charming. In all, I would have to say I enjoyed my 4 nights here. It was safe, quiet, inexpensive, clean, and had a charm that you don't see in the newer, chain hotels."

The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a great location--between the Castro district and downtown--some very nice cafes and restaurants right across the road. The hotel has character and is the best budget place I've ever stayed in. I highly recommend it."

"Review_13023","hotel_161","hotel_6951","Jul 9, 2008","Ideal cheap hotel in San Francisco The York Hotel is a ideal place to stay if you are looking for something cheap and cheerful in San Francisco. It's about 10 mins walk from Union Square and very convienient for riding the trams. It does not have any parking but they have a deal with a local car park. If you take advantage of the valet parking service it will cost you $35 dollars per day. But you drive your car there yourself and it will only cost you $21 per day, its only 2 min walk to the hotel from the car parkThe hotel does need a refurbishment ( I believe there is one planned for Autumn) but its clean, tidy and the staff are very friendly and helpful. So if you are looking for a cheap hotel in San Francisco just to shower and put your head down after a days sight seeing then I would reccomend the York Hotel"

"Review_13027","hotel_161","hotel_4772","Mar 27, 2008","Charming Property, Great Value, Highly Underrated The York Hotel is a wonderfully charming property, that is without a doubt highly underrated and great for the value. I booked my room via Expedia for $89, which included a free breakfast (didn't take advantage of that so I can't comment) as well as free Wifi. The York Hotel is about to begin a huge transformation into the Hotel Vertigo (it is one of the filming locations of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo), and I was given the model room, which was an already renovated room as a preview of what the new rooms will look like. For $89/night, I was blown away. Service wise, every staff member was kind and courteous, and willing to help with anything possible. The room was very modern, with an extremely comfortable bed, very modern nightstands, and a cool bathroom, as well. Beautiful plasma TV, the only thing that didn't work was the AC/heater. This was not a problem, as the window could be opened and closed and I quickly found a nice temperature. Since I can't comment on the current rooms, I'm not sure how applicable this review is to those visiting in the very near future, but if possible do request the model room and I'm sure you will not be disappointed. I enjoy the decor of places like The Clift of The W, and the room was definitely on a par with those properties.As other reviews say, yes, the walls are paper thin, but are nowhere near as big a problem as other people point out. Definitely not enough to keep you awake. Parts of the hotel that are already renovated are very chic and modern, others still have that old/floral design, but personally I didn't find this bothersome. The surrounding area, while a bit of a hike (let's say a 10 min walk) from Union Square was through a very interesting area (very artsy), I felt safe no matter what time of the day or night.I have no complains at all about this property, and while it certainly isn't a 5-star property like a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton, it's a great option if you're on a budget but want something nice."
"Review_13028","hotel_161","hotel_1303","Mar 14, 2008","Fun and reasonable, got what I paid for. I got a $69 rate here and had to pay a $25 cancellation fee to shameful Orbitz to get out of the over-priced ambiance-lacking hotel I had pre-booked. If you like old hotels, get there now because they're about to really remodel it. The Hitchcock film Vertigo was filmed in part there. Breakfast was fine. You are close to Union Square, but not as close as they would infer. Parking is 28.50. No real amenities here, but clean and nice. If you are an adventurous cigarette smoker, you can crawl out your window onto the fire escape to avoid the cleaning charge. Don't ask the front desk about this. The one Elevator is small and slow, but that's the way it works in an older hotel. Funky, fun, but sadly, the Rainbow Room of SF and Vertigo fame is closed."
"Review_13029","hotel_161","hotel_6955","Feb 29, 2008","OK place if you get a good deal This hotel is decent, but certainly not nice. I was in SF for a weekend in January and got a travelzoo special for $59 a night, which is pretty dang cheap for San Francisco. If you're just looking for a place to sleep that is close enough to walk to most of the sights downtown - this place does the trick. The hallways and rooms kind of reminded me of a retirement home (floral carpets, ugly wallpaper, bad art) and the bed was actually pretty awful. Also, the walls are PAPER thin. Seriously, I've never been anywhere with walls like this. You could literally hear the neighbor's conversation word-for-word when they were just talking at a normal volume. Thankfully our neighbors went to sleep around the same time as us (and they were speaking French which actually makes it easier to tune-out if you don't speak the language). If you had some late-night neighbors, this place could potentially be intollerable.All in all, if you can get a cheap deal on this place, don't mind walking about a 1/2 mile to get to the nearest subway, and don't plan on spending much time in your room - this place is fine. Bring ear plugs though just in case."

The neighborhood is also undergoing an exciting transformation from a quiet one to a young hip artsy one- thanks to the Academy of Art.

The bed was probably the worst I have ever slept on at a hotel in my life. In addition to that, the walls are paper thin. We were at the very end of the hall, so I had hoped that it wouldn't be too noisy, but we could very clearly hear the loud running, stomping, and yelling ALL NIGHT! I guess I shouldn't have expected much, given that the room was only $125. Don't bother booking a room here if you want any type of luxury. We will not be returning."

Safe neighbourhood and only a block to a cable car line, a 6 minute walk downhill to Union Square and about 15 minutes to the Moscone Center.It is certainly tired and somewhat shabby but still decent. Decor was once very nice but now dated. Suites are serviced daily, the kitchen cabinetry has been updated even though the stove is old. Kitchens have a full size fridge. The kitchen was very poorly equipped with only one very large saucepan and fry pan - and only a few utensils so any serious meal preparation was not practical.The weather was mild during my stay which was fortunate as there was NO airconditioning and the baseboard heating looked as though it probably didnt function. There was a pedestal fan in the hall cupboard.Staff were very helpful and friendly. I didnt partake of the continental breakfast so cant comment.The basement has a row of new  clean commercial washing and drying machines. Very reasonable rates for using these machines. There are also snack vending machines down thereThe other advantage is that it has plenty of off street PARKING. $35,00 per day but worth it in this city where parking is very difficult in most areas.Would I stay there again? Most likely - if it wasnt high summer or mid winter. Despite its drawbacks, I thought it good value in an expensive city."
"Review_13038","hotel_162","hotel_4030","Nov 24, 2008","Great Location, great staff I have just returned from a 13 night stay at the Grosvenor, and couldn't recommend it highly enough.The location is perfect, handy to everything in San Francisco; views are fantastic and rooms are fitted out to a very high standard and excellent value for money. Their was no air-conditioning in my room, which might be a problem at some times of the year. The staff (particularly John and Tony) are exceptional, friendly and (with the exception of one night clerk) went out of their way to help me. If I had one gripe it would be that while the rooms do have a kitchenette with full-size fridge and cofee maker, the only cooking facility is a microwave, meaning I couldn't take advantage of the great produce at the Ferry Terminal farmers market. Book through the hotel's internet site rather than any of the third party sites if you're staying for longer than 7 days for their discount."
"Review_13039","hotel_162","hotel_2318","Nov 20, 2008","Would stay here again Just got back from SF. I stayed at the Grosvenor Suites downtown. It is centrally located near Union Square, Chinatown, and the Cable Cars. I recommend taking a taxi or cable car (if you don't have luggage) to get to the hotel since the walk up Powell is steep. Other than that, check-in went smooth. The guy who checked me in was very nice and made sure to book me a room with a view. I got a corner room on the eighth floor with a fantastic view. The room itself was very spacious. There is no air conditioning or heat in the room. It was hot when I arrived, so I opened the sliding glass door. They also have a tall fan in the closet that I used to cool things down. The bed was quite comfortable since I slept very well. It was not very noisy outside unless you open your sliding glass door. But once it was shut, it kept out most of the noise. I mostly heard a few car horns, some sirens, and the ding of the cable car, but it did not wake me up in the middle of the night. The furniture was a bit dated, but decent. The kitchen and bathroom had granite countertops. A few dishes, silverware, and pots and pans were provided, but I only used a plate and knife, which I made sure to wash. The stove/oven was outdated, but I made good use of the oven and it worked well. The bathroom was small, but it served its purpose. I did not like that there was not much counter space in the bathroom and the shower head is pretty low if you are tall. But it worked.The tv was another complaint. Some channels did not show up in the lineup and I had to manually punch those channels into the remote. A few channels were not very clear. The remote itself did not have an on button, only an off button, which I found odd. I had to get up to turn on the tv. Continental breakfast was decent. Nothing fancy. Just juices, coffee, bagels, cereal, etc. A computer is provided for your use, as well as an ATM machine, a laundry room, and snack/drink/ice machines. I did not like going down to the level where the snack machines were. Seemed a bit dark, like in a basement and I felt a little uncomfortable down there. The laundry room is also located on that level.Other than a few minor issues, I would stay here again. It was priced well and if you book online, you can get daily rebates, which saves you more money. It is a great place to stay if you are on a budget and want to be close to places like Union Square."

We needed a hotel with lots of space, finally able to have some own cooked food, comfortable and not too far from U.Sq  Chinatown. Grosvenor Suite was a great choice. There's lot of storage space - too much in fact unless you plan to stay for months, clean  good firm beds. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Continential breakfast was much better than other hotels that we have been to. Downside was the bathroom a tad small and also the storage area in our bathroom smell musty as it was hardly used  no ventilation.

"Review_13041","hotel_162","hotel_2532","Nov 16, 2008","Space and great views but wouldnt stay again I booked this because we needed a cost efficeint place to stay as a couple with our grown up son on a short sightseeing trip to SF between visiting friends in Sonoma and travelling on to Charlston for a conference. Our primary concerns for this trip was that the hotel be cheap and spacious with a safe location close to the action and that is exactly what we got. The bonus was that the views from the 14th floor suite were brilliant , our son didnt close the curtains so he could fall asleep looking at beautiful S F twinkling below and listening to the Cable cars bells.... a truly unique experience we couldnt have had in lots of other nicer , pricey hotels. Given that bonus, and that it full filled our needs I feel bad about saying anything negative about the place , but we have to be honest on these reviews so that others can benefit from the comments and make an informed decision... so here goes.I found the place a bit seedy to be honest with some worrying safety issues. I expected dated and that was not a problem for me, older worn furniture was what I expected , but the level of maintaninence was what let the place down badly. The paintwork was chipped , walls marked, stained carpets, and a general sad air of disrepair prevailed about the place, some of it went beyond cosmetic being serious safety issues.The windows are single glazed with aluminium frames that actually opened which is needed as the place got really hot and no air con. Our smaller opening windows on the 14th floor were broken and just about hanging in there, god help anyone below when they eventually do break and the large shards fall 14 floors down. The smell in the corridors was not good, mainly from cooking odours I think, however our corner suite got the sun more or less all day and this warmed up the vinyl coating on the curtain linings and gave off a horrible toxic plastic smell that made me feel ill. The breakfast was a grab and go affair really as there was not enough seating to stay , so I just took the mugs from the room down and loaded upa a tray with coffee, juice and muffins. You have to stand and tell the lady behind the pastry counter what you want, she was very surly, never smiled and you felt like she begrudged you every item you took, not good.Staff on the front desk were Ok , some better than others.but at least it was always manned and they helped with taxis and directions with efficiency.Location not good if you have mobility issues , but then San Francisco is very hilly so I think you have to accept that and the walk down to Union Sq was easy as it was all downhill ad took about 6 mins.Just one thing I wish I had known , you can buy an all day pass on the Cable cars for $11 dollars. We bought $5 single tickets not realising , and I think this would be a fun thing to do staying at the Grosvenor as you could have a pretty good sighseeing tour of the city just using the CC's from this location.Best experience , Alcatraz night tour and wondering aroound the Hyde pier and along the beach at Aqua Park on a sunny afternoon, then over to the Chocolate place at Ghiradelli Square for an Ice cream sundae.Have fun."

The bed was very comfortable and there were two dressers and three large closets. They serve a continental breakfast in a small room on the lobby level. The coffee was not very good, but they had a variety of juices, tea and pastry, donuts, bagels and cereal; a nice convenience for those who want to grab a quick bite and go. I would recommend the Grosvenor Suites to business travelers or those who plan on spending a majority of their time out and about. My husband easily accessed the BART system to several business meetings in Walnut Creek by walking down a few blocks to the station in Union Square (the walk back up to the hotel was a true San Francisco experience.) The hotel was by no means cozy, charming or particularly attractive; but its convenient location and room rates cannot be beat."

We asked for and were give a corner view room. I booked it online directly with them. It was a large suite with lots of closet space. A small kitchenette was nice to have. The carpets were really dirty and I made my kids were socks or slippers all the time. The views were great, we had a small (scary) balcony that we didn't let the kids on. 2 queens in the bedroom and a pull out sofa in the living room. Room 1511.  I hadn't seen this mentioned on any other reviews, but the bathroom was TINY! I had to walk all the way in and then turn around to close the door. The shower was short (a major peeve of mine at 5'10). The heat (baseboard heaters) must have been on some sort of timer, every night they came on and were full force. We had the windows open every night. When we told the front desk, he just shrugged at me. I left a note for housekeeping and it was off when we got back in the late afternoon, but back on after we got back from dinner. The location is great...downhill to Union Square, but you can jump on a cable car to get back. We took several cabs, which were way cheaper than the 5 of us going by cable car. ($5 each one way) We did get a couple of complimentary rides on the CC's. I booked online and got a total of $70 off for an online rebate for the room.Secured parking behind the hotel was nice and at $35 night was a little less than the other hotels. Decent continental breakfast.If you go to the Academy of Sciences...buy your tickets online, go early and get your planetarium and 3D show time tickets as soon as you get in. If you have more than one adult...send one to get in line for the rain forest, one to the planetarium and one to the 3D. It was crazy busy on 11/10/08. Worth the waits, but will be much easier to navigate when the crowds die down."

"Review_13048","hotel_162","hotel_1287","Oct 25, 2008","Dated, but of good value 5 of us stayed on the 15th floor, corner (1503) with 2 queens and a sofa bed. I was a bit dismayed by the drabness of the rooms and dirty carpet, but praise the location, the view, the helpfullness of the staff, the spaciousness of the living room, the full kitchen/dining area and the view, the view and the view. We had very warm days and cool nights, so found it nice at night, in spite of the city noise-loved to hear the cable car bell. The Powell (Hyde or Mason) Cable car stop is a block down a decent hill and the Mark Hopkins is directly across the street up a very steep hill. It costs about $8+ for a taxi from the Wharf and about $40-45 to the airport. You are 5 minutes away from Sears (for breakfast, even during lunch) and the shopping at Union Sq. and about the same from Chinatown. The wharf is better reached via Cable Car, trolley (from Powell/Market), taxi or bus. It is very doable (no hills) by walking to Chinatown, then through little Italy, but can be long. Our stay, with the on-line rebate averaged $200 a night, a steal in this city. I wish it had been better updated, the carpet scared me.

"Review_13052","hotel_162","hotel_8272","Oct 19, 2008","Great location with precious space in SFO We stayed for 4 nights 11-15 OCT in a 1 BR apt. 18th Floor and had a smooth stay. Great views of the bay. We were lucky that it was fleet week and could see the aircrafts zoom past from our window, not to mention the fireworks at night! Agreed that the bathroom was small but that is a small price to pay for its fantastic location. After hearing all sorts of stories about so many locations, this was was perfect. Situated a block from the Intercon / Fairmont on nob hill, posh area, we felt safe and could walk to china town/union square etc. Agreed that the hotel is on a slope and the upward walk can be hard, but only if you have any knee probs. Overall a good choice, especially if with family. We like spacious rooms so this was a treat. The breakfast could do with a few additions but for a start its not bad. We saw people Q-ing up for BF on the restaurants rond the corner so whatever little we got, was sufficient to kick start yoyur day. The rooms were clean and the reception staff was friendly. The tram is also round the corner to take you to the wharf/union Sq. I would defi recomend this place for a central location and the luxury of space for the price it charges! We would defi stay there whenever we go back to SFO! Do keep a map with you and know your surroundings as it all depends on what you a re looking for. The wharf was so crowded and touristy, so this area was good for us."

We stayed at Grosvenor Suites for 7 nights in early Oct 2008 - family with 3 girls aged 13, 11  10. The location was great, being close to Westfield, the Bart and many bus stops to Fisherman's Wharf. We enjoyed cheap and cheerful meals at Chinatown for dinner (3 nights) and on another 2 nights even bought takeaway roast pork, rice and soy chicken (and cooked our own vegies also bought in Chinatown) back to the hotel for dinner. The hotel is on a steep hill (particularly the last 2 blocks) and gives you a great workout whenever you return. I found that I could run from Nordstroms at Westfield back to Grosvenor Suites in 13 minutes by the end of the week. (Still, I was late meeting the tribe by the promised time because there was just sooo much shopping to be done).The decor is a little dated, but everything was generally clean, except the vent over the stove. With our family of 5, we fit comfortably into the one bedroom suite. Hubby drew the short straw and slept on the sofa bed, which he did not find comfortable.The rest of us slept soundly on the 2 queen beds in the bedroom. We had a corner suite on Level 15 with a view of Transamerica Tower, with microwave, stove and large fridge. There was crockery and cutlery for 4 and basic pots, pans and utensils. The room was also relatively quiet, considering the city location, except for the one-off siren and the gentle tinkle of the cable cars in the night one block away.The staff were friendly and helpful. The manager kindly offered to call our bus when he saw us waiting at the door for our tour bus. Breakfast consisted of cereal boxes, bagels, danishes, tea, coffe and juices. The breakfast room only seated about 12 people, so sometimes we had breakfast to go and ate in our suite. We booked our suite throught the hotel website and receive an online rebate which basically covered the tax on the accommodation with about $20 to spare.Good value, family-friendly, great location, and a free workout to burn off the carbs - what more can you ask for?"

The location is excellent, the service friendly and the rooms spacious and although a little dated, very comfortable indeed, with a balcony and good views. A computer with free internet access behind Reception was a bonus. We walked to most places and there are some great little restaurants and bars within easy walking distance to the Grosvenor.

For what we paid we were really pleased with the standard of the suite.There was also a free Continental breakfast each morning which was good. The breakfast room is a bit small so we would get a tray and take it back to the room. The location was also great.

Last week I stayed at the Grosvenor Suites with two girlfriends for this reason. I am always looking for a comfortable, well located, reasonably priced, clean and safe place to stay in the city. I hate spending too much because I am out all day but want a nice place to return to at night. Grosvenor Suites fit that bill. Staff was extremely friendly, parking (though pricy) was on site and safe, our large suite had all the comforts of home. A little worn but very very clean and comfortable. Our view out of our corner suite was fabulous. We had a kitchenette with m/w, oven, full fridge, etc. Continental breakfast was adequate but fresh. There is basically no lobby to lounge around in or onsite bar and restaurant but you can order food in from somewhere closeby. I would definately recommend this place and will return soon."

We had a wonderful stay. By far, the best features of this hotel are its location and the incredible views (it's a tall building near the top of Nob Hill).The location is perfect -- just one block from two cable car routes, only a short walk to Union Square, and only a short walk to Chinatown. We loved being in the middle of everything -- it was very convenient. The views were spectacular -- we had great views of Coit tower and the Transamerica building.We stayed in a one-bedroom suite. It had a nice kitchenette -- full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave oven, all the plates/glasses/utensils you would need. The unit was spacious. In addition to the bedroom and kitchen, there was a living area and a dining area. The rooms could use a little renovating, but it wasn't that bad. We were very happy with them.The continental breakfast was good -- bagels, pastries, donuts, cereal, coffee, juice. The wireless Internet worked great. The parking, while expensive ($35/day), was very easy and convenient. The staff was very friendly.Overall, we had great stay and would definitely recommend it."
"Review_13061","hotel_162","hotel_1058","Aug 21, 2008","Recommended, but not for business travelers I stayed here on a brief business trip after reading a lot of positive reviews online. I'm sure this hotel is fine for vacationers: the rooms are ok (especially the kitchenettes), the location is pretty good, and the staff are helpful. However, I don't recommend it for those who need to come back in the evenings and work on their computer. The lighting in the rooms is even dimmer than the hotel norm, and the wireless internet mostly non-existent (at least while I was staying). It just isn't worth it."
"Review_13062","hotel_162","hotel_5211","Aug 5, 2008","Great location, good service, but very dated We stayed there for 3 nights recently. We specifically chose this property as we were travelling with our 5 month old son so the in room kitchen facilities were useful. The only negative I have is the decor - still in its 1970s-style and our room wasn't particularly well maintained. A conduit covering was hanging off the wall and had clearly been that way for a while. On the plus side, the location is excellent, although the walk from Union Square gives your legs a great workout. Staff were fine, there's a useful laundry in the basement and the views are great. The bed was big and comfortable, very useful as we'd just arrived from Australia and were jetlagged. It was also very quiet within the hotel, the only sounds coming from the street outside, but the corner of Mason and Pine is actually a very quiet bit of Nob Hill.We had arranged for a child seat we bought on line to be delivered to the hotel, and the hotel handled this well, delivering it to our room when it arrived at the hotel.Overall, I'd probably still recommend Grosvenor Suites, as long as you're not expecting a flash new interior."
"Review_13063","hotel_162","hotel_1277","Jul 30, 2008","Really mixed feelings about the Grosvenor Suites I can honestly say that I have never had such mixed feelings about any place my family has visited. There is so much about the Grosvenor that is simply 5 star: unbelievable views that any top of the line hotel would die for; nice layout of a small one bedroom apartment that was more than spacious for three of us; some tasteful updates like granite and modern fixtures in the very small bathroom; a fabulous location that really makes it easy to take advantage of everything San Francisco offers. And then there are some things that are strictly 1 star: chipped paint on window sills that have been repaired with mismatched paint; a crack in the window; tears in the linings of drapes; grimy door and window jambs; piled on grease on the exhaust fan in the kitchenette (so much that I wouldn't use the rangetop); a really suspect bedspread; broken heating covers. If it had not been for the 5 star elements, we would have checked out instantly. Gratefully, Housekeeping did an awesome job with daily cleaning, but really basic, quality maintenance is needed. Another reviewer said that this is not a luxury hotel and that is right on the money. The lovely rooms shown on their website are long term rentals only so be prepared for something less. If the units are maintained as they should be, there is no question that the Grosvernor Suites would be the best deal in town. I guess the bottom line is: would we stay again? ONLY if I researched all other options, and had the assurance from management that we would once again have the incredible views that make up for the inside of the unit."
"Review_13064","hotel_162","hotel_6954","Jul 8, 2008","Incredible Value We just returned from our California/ Nevada vacation and spent 3 nights at the Grosvenor Suites. I cannot reccomend this place enough. We had a HUGE one bedroom suite (3 adults, 2 kids) with the most incredible views of San Francisco from the top of Nob Hill. The Living Room had windows on 2 sides that looked out to the water and down the hill to some beautiful churches, as well as the TransAmerica Building. Better views (IMO) then from the Top Of The Mark accross the street. We had a kitchenette that we used to store our wine, cheese, snacks and additional breakfast items to supplement the free breakfast provided buy the hotel. The hotel staff was very accomodating with extra requests for towels etc.. Parking was 35.00 a day but that's about average for San Francisco. Cable Cars are located at the corner making life very convenient. Wish the bathroom was bigger but other then that a great, great value. I will definitely stay here again...it was like having our own private apartment in the city."

We arrived early at noon and was told our room was ready so we could check in! We were so happy with the size of the room. We had a one room suite, which consisted of a separate bedroom, full kitchen/ living/dining room areas surrounded by windows! We were on the 17th floor with a spectacular view! Everyone was so nice and helpful with directions, recommendations, etc.We are at Uncle Vitos around the corner for lunch. We called in for delivery from Pronto Pizza one night. Both were very reasonable!It was a wonderful location. One block to the cable cars, 2 blocks to Walgreens, one block to the market, short walking distance to Chinatown...One night we ventured over to The Top of the Mark for a drink! What a view that is!Took the cable cars and busses everywhere except for a Saturday night coming back from the Wharf, the cable cars were packed so we ended up walking all the way back! Only a couple tough hills! Take your time and you can do it!!Good to have breakfast included! Not nothing huge, but enough to get you going for the day!Got a great price for a great room! Would stay here for sure if I ever make it back to San Francisco!"

We were very pleased with our experience. The hotel is located in a great location right on the cable car line in the Nob Hill area of town inbetween Union Sqaure and Fisherman's Warf. The continental breakfasts were superb! The rooms were large and even included a kitchen that we didn't use. In the Spring the price and location couldn't be beat, though in the Summer when the cable cars are a lot more crowded it may take longer to get places but walking is always an option! Don't miss the Nob Hill Cafe just a couple blocks away - amazing restaurant that is super popular with the locals so arrive by 5 or be prepared to wait - but its worth it!!"
"Review_13067","hotel_162","hotel_1122","Jun 14, 2008","More than we wanted! We were sooooooo impressed with Grosvenor. Maybe it's because I knew big cities like San Francisco don't lend well to large hotel rooms. Whatever the reason, we thought Grosvenor Suites were exactly what we wanted and more.We got the smallest room and were still incredibly impressed by the size of the room. For a San Francisco mid-range hotel, this place has spacious rooms! The kitchen made our place really feel like home. And, we had TONS of closet space that was quite nice. Everything we needed - iron/ironing board, hair dryer, coffee pot, cooking utensils, eating utensils, etc. - we found easily in our room. The bed was comfortable. And, the view was so great.Service was good. We were greeted kindly upon arrival. The staff was friendly and the guy who checked us in even told us he would try and get us a great view, which he did. Any questions we had, though there weren't many, were quickly and effortless answered. Breakfast was pretty much your standard fare and was nothing impressive, but I never really include that meal in my stay anyhow.The location was possibly the best thing about this place, and that says a lot since we loved everything else. It was literally a block from the top of Nob Hill. This made it easy for us to walk to many of the major tourist attractions like Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square. There is also three cable car stops nearby (like one block!) and I believe other public transportation too.We were so very impressed with our stay. We will be recommending this gem to everyone we know and staying there on our next visit as well."
"Review_13068","hotel_162","hotel_8517","May 28, 2008","Highly Recommend! Online registration on their website was easy, and they offer a great discount. When we got there, someone came out right away to help us with our luggage. Check-in was a breeze, and the room was clean with a spectacular view of the city. We even got the type of room we had requested. What's even better is that they offer free breakfast, free WiFi, computer and printer use, six washers and four dryers (bring quarters), snack and soda machines, and the friendliest front desk staff 24/7. The location was great. The California and Powell cable cars are a block away so we bought the 3-day Muni pass for $18 ea. and caught the cable cars to get around. The weather was perfect and we ended up walking to Union Square several times and found some great restaurants along the way. The room has a kitchenette and refrigerator which were perfect for our leftovers and late night snacks. Even had a dining table and a comfortable couch. Loved this place!"

Rooms:The hotel decor is a bit on the old side - it's not a luxury hotel, but rather it's an affordable and basic option. The kitchenette that came in each room was great! With a young child, it was a nice option to have. The rooms were very spacious - probably the largest room I've stayed in SF. We had a nice territorial view of Nob Hill.Breakfast:The continental breakfast was great and served in a sunny room. There were bagels, pastries, muffins, fruit and cereal. The coffee was standard-issue, but there was a nice selection of juice. The server who oversees the breakfast didn't even mind that we loaded up on goodies and took it to our room. Location:The location was great! Just 3 blocks and we were in the action of Union Square. The cable car stopped just 1/2 block away. However: BE WARNED: The hotel is up on two VERY steep hills. From Union Square you will be huffing and puffing your way up. (Hence Nob HILL).Staff:Friendly. No problems checking in or anything.Misc: My husband is a much picky-er traveler than I am. He was pleased with this place. The only complaint he had is one of our neighbors was cooking something very pungent and the smell wafted into our room. It was easily remedied by opening a window... not a biggie. Overall we were really pleased with our choice and would stay here again! A GREAT place for families with kids who want a spacious room with kitchenette - just be prepared for the hills."
"Review_13070","hotel_162","hotel_5817","Mar 31, 2008","Great Find in San Fran --- with an even better view from the room! On top of a HUGE hill in the Nob Hill neighborhood, sits a gem of a hotel. Upon walking in we were helped right away and our bags were stored until we could check in. We were told we had a room on floor 18 --- just want I had asked for when reserving --- a room on a high floor. After entering the room, we were amazed by the fantastic view from the window/balcony! Definitely a plus (and even better that they actually fulfilled what I had asked for when reserving). Anyway, here is a list of the pros and cons:Pros:-Great location near cable cars which hook you up to bus lines and the Bart.-Friendly staff/easy check in - stored bags-Immaculate rooms (I even took a peek behind the dresser and there wasn't a speck of dirt)-Rooms come with kitchenettes -- sure you're not going to cook a gourmet meal while in San Fran, but it's nice to have a fridge and microwave, as well as a stove to heat up water for tea.-THE VIEW!!! You must ask for a room on a high floor with a view. It's a MUST!!Cons:-No Wireless Internet (after purchasing a new computer the day before check in I was bummed to find out I couldn't research places in San Fran from my room. There is a complimentary computer in the lobby, but I didn't take advantage of it)-Pillows - They were a little too hard for me, but oh well.-Breakfast - The woman who runs the breakfast room is a doll, but the choices weren't very healthy --- carb concious people beware --- lots of pastries and muffins!! The muffins, etc.... were fine and actually provided a lot of energy for the walks up and down the huge hills.And one last word of advice.....My partner and I came in from SFO on the Bart and got let out at Union Square. I was told we could not bring luggage on the cable car, so instead of getting a cab....we WALKED up the hill(s) to the hotel. It was trek, but an adventure in itself. We were left winded, but happy to be in San Fran! So I suggest getting a cab if you can't walk up the hill(s) --- your knees will thank you!I will definitely be back!"

The suite was clean and spacious and it was nice to have a kitchenette in the room. The staff (from the front desk personnel to the housekeepers and maintenance workers) were all so very helpful and polite. The property is also conveniently located on Nob Hill, within walking distance to Union Square and Chinatown. The cablecar stop is just one street down from the property and while we were there we were able to catch it down to Fisherman's Wharf and back.The complimentary continental breakfast was delicious - they offered pastries, muffins, bagels, fruits, cereal, milk, juice, and coffee.We will definitely stay here again and will be recommending this place to our family and friends."

"Review_13075","hotel_162","hotel_5951","Mar 23, 2008","Just Right First - thanks to all the people who had given reviews about this place and helped me make the decision to book here!. Been at the hotel for 30 days now and it's got everything one needs for an extended stay. I'm in SF for a fellowship at University of California my mother is travelling with me so we needed a place which was located near my campus (Mission bay) and close to the city's attractions to keep mom occupied. Loads of PROS so i'll start with the CONSCONS: This is NOT a LUXURY hotel as the website describes it to be! the furniture, carpets in the hallway and the general building is tired - its not dirty or smelly - just old fashioned. No marble bathroom or fluffy towels - just basic stuff (which isn't bad). Breakfast is disappointing - bagels, croissants, doughnuts, tea/coffee and thats it (no bread is served). I would've liked a hot option as well - but hey enough to get you going in the morning. The maid cleans the room/changes towels, bedding every week - would be better if it was twice a week.Steep hills of Nob hill - if you have problems walking then consider the fact that this place is at the top of a very steep hill from several directions!PROS: good service - when i booked (over the fone) i requested a room not higher than the 10th floor and not to be next to the lift and when i checked in i got a room on the 7th flr away from the lift.staff at the main desk were very helpful when I asked for directions, bus routes and other city questions. hotel's location couldn't be better - the cable cars are at your doorstep which go to Fisherman's Wharf/China town/Union sq etc. Union Sq. and the big shopping names( Macy's, Niketowm, Banana Republic, Old Navy are walking distance from the hotel. Several Muni bus routes are easily accesible from Stockton which like 5 mins from the hotel.Value for money: We've paid $2600 for a suite for 30 days included in this is a VERY large room with a fully equiped kitchen - stove (electric), microwave, toaster, full size fridge, pots and pans, cutlery enough for 4. Two double beds, A TV, wireless internet, loads of storage space, iron board, iron, a clean good sized bathroom with a bath tub. In the basement they have washing machines and tumbler dryers to use at a nominal price.Conclusion: The place is well located in the heart of SF. Very large clean rooms and helpful staff.VERDICT: i would recommend this place to everyone - just dont expect a Hilton or Marriot furnished room."

We booked this hotel as a second choice when the historic first choice could not accomodate 5 people in one room due to fire code regs. Boy, am I glad we stayed here!! The rates are so reasonable, the rooms are huge, the windows actually open for fresh air, we had 3 walk-in closets, a comfy sofabed, lamps, end tables, a dinette, and a full kitchen. There is even great storage in the bathroom. And a complimentary continental breakfast each day! We stayed with three kids durning Feb. break, and this was the perfect hotel. It's right near the cable car lines, and Union Square, and a short walk to Chinatown. There are convenient and wonderful restaurants, markets, and shops right around all 4 corners. And many deliver, too.There are no grumps employed here. The staff are professional and promt. We often needed many extra towels and pillows, and even glass cleaner was delivered to our door within minutes of our phoning to ask.We will stay here on our next visit to San Fransisco.

"Review_13086","hotel_163","hotel_8599","Dec 7, 2008","Okay for the price I found this motel via the internet-it was our third trip to SF and we decided to try something different than our first stay, which was in the financial district (second visit was a one day trip). The website was very well written and the photos were very enchanting. We were a bit disappointed upon our arrival. Not having much knowledge of the area, we did not realize the motel is right on a main thoroughfare; very busy with traffic. The pictures on the website and the customer reviews create this image of a motel nestled in a quiet corner of the Marina district, but this is not true. The room was quite small but okay for the two of us. We were right next to a room which allowed pets and the walls were very thin, so we heard the dogs barking for 5 hours straight one night because they left them unattended in their room. We almost called management but it was our last night, so we didn't make a big deal about it. Also, we could hear the neighbors coming in and out each and every time. The room was clean but they had a very old style heater in the room and it only heated the top half of the room. So, when we were on the bed watching tv, we would be cold but when we stood up, it would be toasty warm. It was okay for the duration of our visit and for the price, well, we got what we paid for, in our opinion. The website and the pictures are in a way, deceiving because there are no cobblestones in the courtyard and it wasn't really a quiet stay. I think if they included a picture of their neon lit sign, which is conveniently left out of the pictures on the website, people wouldn't be so quick to fall in love with the place; sight unseen."

Each room was clean, no smells, and well equipped with the usual necessities. My room faced the street and was indeed noisy and shook with the big trucks but this did not bother me at all. It was just part of the city. The other rooms were interior courtyard rooms and were very quiet. There are window boxes full of colorful flowers and there is a little interior hallway  The staff was very friendly and helpful both in booking months ahead and while we were there. Talk to them about the room noise if that is a problem for anyone in your party.  This motel is in the Marina district which proved to be perfect. It is only a short walk to all kinds of restaurants and shopping. We also walked down to the Chrissy Fields Beach one morning. We easily caught the bus to go down to the wharf and another day up to Golden Gate Park. Easy to go anywhere on the buses and trolleys from this motel. There is free, free, free covered parking as a big bonus and the room rates was exceptionally low."
"Review_13088","hotel_163","hotel_9374","Sep 1, 2008","Great Location for a Quaint Hotel The last few reviews are fairly accurate. We had a Lombard-side room which was fairly noisy. Lombard is a major throroughfare, so there is traffic at most hours of the night, with just a small decrease in the wee hours. Had we know, I certainly would have requested an inner courtyard or east side room. Also, the DVD player on our TV had tape over it, which seemed a bit tacky.That said, it is a sweet place in a great location. The room was comfortable and well-maintained. The same family has owned/managed the hotel since it was build in 1939, which says a lot. You can see they put some care into the maintenance (they were painting garden scenes on the walls during our stay). There's lots of stuff within walking distance (Presidio, Chestnut St., etc.) or bus line (Alcatraz trip, Embarcadero). And the price is quite reasonable for SF. We would definitely stay again assuming we could move the room."

We took sleeping pills to help us get an hour or two of rest, but still found it difficult. We tried to change our room, but the Motel was fully booked, so we decided it was easier to stay for our remaining three nights than to pack up and try again. It did mean we spent every waking moment away from our room. We crammed a lot into our 5 days in San Francisco!!"
"Review_13090","hotel_163","hotel_5706","Aug 23, 2008","Good value-not perfect My mom and I stayed at the Marina Motel recently. I brought my small dog along too and we stayed for 3 nights. Overall, this was a good place to stay, despite a few flaws. It seems there are trade-offs with every place, so this was no exception. The Chestnut St. neighborhood has a lot of good restaurants and shops (including a couple of pet-related shops and Peets Coffee), and we liked the proximity to the Palace of FIne Arts, Crissy Field and the Presidio. It's close to the Golden Gate Bridge. The motel is also within walking distance to a neighborhood called Cow Hollow. So, the location is one of the best things about the motel. We liked the fact that we could park underneath our unit (most of the time), and the motel setting is very pretty with lots of bouganvillia, fuschia, etc. Cheerful. A real plus is that they allow pets and don't charge you an arm and a leg to stay there. The rooms weren't perfect - the windows had a mind of their own and the radiator was unpredictable and noisy. The door could use weather stripping. It was really nice that there were windows on both sides of the room. The beds were okay - we had 2 full size beds and one of them seemed newer because it was quite a bit firmer than the other one. The room was pretty clean and the staff friendly. One corner of the carpet smelled a bit like pet urine. The bathroom had a window which was nice and the shower was roomy and everything worked well. You aren't supposed to leave your pet in the room alone, which we obeyed, but our neighbors left their dog in their room alone and it barked often. The TV was a modern flat screen. Would I recommend this place? Yes, definitely, despite a few minor flaws."
"Review_13091","hotel_163","hotel_9099","Aug 10, 2008","Not the Ritz, but a decent place to stay We found the place thru Frommers and it has already been mentioned that this place is not the Ritz. We got a family room. Which is 2 rooms and a bathroom. The front room is facing Lombard, so it is very loud, but our kids sleep like bricks, so they were fine. The back room was alittle quieter, so that worked better for us. If noise is a problem for you, I would not recommend the rooms that are up along Lombard. Ask for the rooms on the back side of the motel. But this worked fine for us and the fridge and microwave were useful.The rooms were both very dated and tiny. There is barely a foot of walking room around the beds. The bathroom is actually spacious in comparison even though very dated.The rooms are kept clean and the maid was always done with the rooms before we came back around lunchtime. There are so many great places to eat on Chestnut street, this was a great location. Alot of sights are within walking distance if you don't mind hiking it. But there are bus stops all over the place and you can get anywhere if you hop on the right bus. It did take a bit to figure out the right bus though, so I suggest you look at the routes online before your trip, or use their free wi-fi when you get to the motel. Or I imagine you can pick up a bus schedule somewhere. Bus 39 on Chestnut went everywhere though: Fisherman's wharf, Little Italy, China Town, Financial district. Or ask for a transfer when you board the bus. Also, the bus drivers were all very friendly if you need help.Overall, the price was nice compared to other places in the area and the free parking would make it a steal if you have a car (we just walked everywhere though).Take advantage of the BOGO breakfast coupon from the lobby. The prices were high, but if you're buying just 2 dishes, then the free one makes up for the overpriced first dish. But be ready, everything in San Fran is expensive, so this is not a bad deal at all. Also, check the times on the coupon before you go. I think Sundays had a time restriction."
"Review_13092","hotel_163","hotel_1054","Aug 3, 2008","Sleep tight...but be careful in room 28 We are frequent travelers who look for the best value for the money- the Marina Motel seemed to fit all of our requirements- reasonable price, good location, parking included, kitchenette, free wi-fi. With three people in the party we tried to book a room with two double beds, but they were already booked, so we had a double with a rollaway cot- ROOM 28. It was a very small room, but adequate and on the inner courtyard to reduce the noise from Lombard Street. The location is around the corner from Chestnut Street which has good restaurants, a market for groceries, and a stop for the bus to go downtown. All in all we liked it except:After a couple of days, we discovered some strange bugs on the walls and bed-we did an internet search and also took a couple of them to Heidi, the manager, who confirmed that they were indeed bedbugs. She was very proactive and called Terminex immediately, but they could not come until the next day- in the interim the staff vacuumed and cleaned the room thoroughly. Being a summer weekend in San Francisco, with most hotels filled, we did not have many options other than giving them a chance to try to eliminate the problem. However, when we returned to the room after Terminex had been there and steam cleaned, there were still bugs in the room, and the rollaway was too wet to sleep on, either from the steam cleaning or something being spilled on it. The night clerk was less than helpful, seemed to be a surfer dude/space cadet- he did not want to contact Heidi and told us we could bite the bullet and stay, or find another hotel ( not easy at midnite on Saturday). He did make a few calls to hotels, then said he couldn't help us anymore because he had paperwork to do. When he was finally convinced to call Heidi, she was of course very upset that we still had a problem.  We were able to make reservations elsewhere for the remainder of our stay, but one of our party came home covered with terrible bites, requiring a day off from work for a doctor's visit and steroid prescriptions to alleviate the inflamation and itching. Overall, there were a lot of things to recommend this motel, but under the circumstances it was a disastrous stay, and knowing what we do now, we would have moved out immediately upon finding the first evidence of bedbugs.  We know that this can happen at any hotel and we thought Heidi was very friendly, responsive, concerned and cooperative, but we heard from one desk clerk that this had been a problem in this room before- if that is true, they need to be more agressive in their monitoring of the rooms. Also, a certain desk clerk needs to be a little less laid back and more customer friendly."
"Review_13093","hotel_163","hotel_1220","Jul 16, 2008","Unique Personality You can see what we mean by unique personality from the photographs on the Marina Motel website, www.marinamotel.com. The Marina Motel is an excellent value in a good location for anyone who enjoys walking in San Francisco neighborhoods, such as the Marina, and along the edge of San Francisco Bay, which is just a few blocks north of the motel. There are many good restaurants, coffee shops, and other neighborhood commercial establishments nearby, especially along Chestnut Street behind the motel. Although the rooms are small by today's standards, keep in mind that the Marina Motel is a motel of the late 1930s in style and layout, which owners have taken care to respect while modernizing in other ways for visitor convenience and comfort. Although not within walking distance to SF downtown (Union Square area), it's easy to get there by public transportation or driving your own car. Likewise any other SF neighborhood of interest. Wherever you want to go, you can count on the people at the front desk to help you find your way. We look forward to our next visit."

They do a really nice job of keeping the place clean and comfortable.There are no frills in this charming place but they like dogs and the price is great, the location is also excellent and very safe.You can walk to the Presidio in about 5 mins and there is a small dog park just through the entrance. I would stay here again , choose a room thats not facing Lombard as I imagine they would be quite noisy."
"Review_13095","hotel_163","hotel_1579","Apr 14, 2008","A Great Bargain for San Francisco I have stayed at the Marina Motel many times. For one thing, parking is free in individual covered spaces. That's no small deal because a typical hotel will charge $20 - $30 per night for parking in San Francisco. If you are looking for a Holiday-Inn-style place this is probably not your motel. This is a 1930's vintage motel and that's part of its charm. All the bathrooms have been modernized, and the staff keeps the place very clean. If you can get one of the rooms with a kitchen, it will really help you keep your expenses down by eating a few meals in your room. There are a bunch of great restaurants at various price levels within walking distance of the motel. The staff at the motel are really friendly and extremely helpful. One caveat, I always request a room that is away from Lombard street because it is a heavily travelled street with a lot of noise."
"Review_13096","hotel_163","hotel_9435","Mar 21, 2008","Good value for your money This was the 4th time in about 6 years that I have stayed here. It is a room to sleep. It can be a place to call home for a few days if you wish to have the room with kitchen. They would then set you up with all cleaning items and utensils that you would have at home. I think it is a great place to stay. It is not the Hilton or the Fairmont, but then the price is not as well. It is so convenient for the Chestnut St. shops and restaurants and just a couple of blocks to all that Union St. has to offer. I know some other person had complaint with staff, but I have never found them to be less than helpful. I can't say enough about how pleasant my stays have been here."
"Review_13097","hotel_163","hotel_2669","Feb 19, 2008","Great value, great area in San Francisco I was a little skeptical about booking this motel after reading some of the reviews, but I'm very happy I chose this motel. My husband and I stayed here for two nights with our two small dogs. Although the room was small, it was clean and had an large dresser and plenty of closet space. The BEST thing about this hotel is the location. It's just a few blocks away from the Marina which me and my husband love, especially with our dogs (there are walking/running paths, a dog beach and spectacular views of the Golden Gate Bridge). The motel was also a block away from great restaurants and shops on Chesnut street where we could eat outside with our dogs. The free parking is also a major plus. I recommend this hotel if you don't want to spend a lot on a hotel, but want a great San Francsico experience."
"Review_13098","hotel_164","hotel_2088","Dec 8, 2008","Think again Hello, I wanted to express my dissatisfaction for our stay at your hotel over the weekend. We found that the lack of room service was horrible. I ordered the deli plate, since that was the only food besides cheese on your menu, the turkey was rotten. For $21.00, that is definitely something to talk about when recommending to friends. We also were surprised about the implied Valet charge. No where on the web site or when I spoke with someone at your hotel regarding the reservation did anyone tell me that there is a $26.00 Valet charge and it is mandatory. In addition to all of those items being below average quality, today when I checked my credit card, there is a pre-authorization for the wrong amount on my card. I have already called and spoke with John in the accounting department. He has been the most helpful and informative. He is going to take care of this for me. I will say that we were there due to a holiday party that we were invited to; I will make sure to tell the business that arranged it so that they never book with your hotel again. I would suggest expanding your room service menu, OFFERING Valet - not mandatory, and post a notice for the procedures for credit/debit card transactions in your lobby for your future guests. These are basic ways to increase your customer satisfaction."

However, the staff were friendly and helpful and the location was good.I do not think we would stay again because the breakfast was poor and we would have really liked to have been able to have room service.

The staff were very friendly and helpful although as has already been said numerous times, the decor is a little bit dated. There is a supermarket across the road and restaurants in the local area. It's about a 20-30 minute walk to the Rodeo Drive shopping district but about $25-30 in a taxi to Hollywood.Overall, I've stay in far worse places than this so I would recommend it to those who want to stay in the Beverly Hills area."

The staff was great. But it feels like people used to stay here, and the hotel never modernized to this century. For example, you have to use valet parking, although there is plenty of parking. It is $26 a day plus tips. Our car was parked 10 feet from us and we had to have the valet move it to us.Also, there is no restaurant or room service. There isn't even a soda machine, so you have to go to the bar and pay $3 plus tip for a soda.The movies on tv are expensive and you cannot pause them. Everything is antiquated, but looks nice."

"Review_13103","hotel_164","hotel_3327","Oct 7, 2008","Not even close to 4 star. Good luck if you cab it! The Tower was supposed to be a 4 star hotel and had the price point that was in line with that rating. Unfortunately, it was not even close to a 4 star. The only 4 star amenity was the valet parking and doorman. I chose to take a cab to the hotel as I was there on business. My cab driver had never heard of this place and my colleagues who took separate cabs experience the same thing. Fortunately I had a map printed and could direct him to the hotel, eventually we discovered together this apartment style building in the midst of a residential area that was well removed from the rest of Beverly Hills. On another night, returning from LA my cab driver claimed to know where the hotel was, but we ended up circling the neighborhood for an extra 10 minutes well I tried to get him to the actual location.The room was quite large and had a nice balcony and a Tempra-pedic bed. However those were the only positive room features. The bedspread had many stains and the furniture was nicked and scraped all over. The bedding package was quite plain (about what you would expect from a 2.5 star hotel) and the bed was very low to the ground.This 4 star hotel's only restaurant was a sports bar with limited hours. A continental breakfast was available on the top floor and was overpriced at $18 for cereal, yogurt, and an egg dish. There was no service whatsoever other then to collect your money.If you are looking for a true 4 star Beverly Hills experience and amenities such as a real restaurant and/or room service I would select another location."

I booked this hotel by name your own price on priceline.com, at first I saw their website and was amazed and happy thinking it was a high end hotel.. Well then I started reading the reviews and they were not so great. Well here is my experience..1. parking is $26.00 a night-- valet only (which means you have to tip everytime they get your car)2. When we checked in, they offered to upgrade us for only $60.00 a night so we said no, so then the guy said how about for $30.00 a night so we still said NO.. then he said ok here are your keys and I went ahead and upgrade you guys anyways for FREE.3. We get to the room we got one in the 9th floor byt the cleaning closet and stairs (so we were like Ok.. ) We saw our balcony and it was huge. So it was ok.. 4. My first impression of the room was WOW.. this is an old decoration!! The carpet was stained in the room and the hallway. The bathroom was ok.. To sum it all up, the room was decent but nothing like a four star hotel. I would of wanted a more updated, cleaner place!"

We were not impressed with the hotel on a whole. I would rate it 2.5 stars. The rooms were outdated and the covers on the bed were not impressive. We did like the tempurpedic beds but thats about it. There really isnt too much around to walk to except the Ralph's grocery store. We did walk to the mall but it was about .8 miles away. All in all L.A. really didn't thrill us. It is too hyped up.

Some Guests did not check out. However, when we arrived, the receptionist STARTED to make calls to find a different room for us, although they had already known after check out that they were overbooked. She sent us to a messed up motel somewhere in LA. I paid $235 for this night. When I asked for a refund, Hotels.com contacted the hotel. They were not willing to refund any money, because they paid that night at the motel ($120). Good deal for them. After I complained and called 4 times, finally we got the money back.I was really frustrated how badly the Tower Beverly Hills handled this situation when we arrived and it was even worse when we tried to get the refund.

Bar was not much to write home about.Typical (but nonetheless unacceptable) Beverly Hills attitude of front desk staff: Tried to check in at 2:15pm, but told it was just not possible until official check-in time at 3:00pm. Also told at check-in that a room facing away from Pico Blvd (heavy traffic) would require a significant extra charge.

In-room internet incurred a daily fee (a practice I find pretty offensive in this day and age) but the hotel provided two terminals in the lobby area, including a printer which gave free access to the web and free printing.Overall, I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants easy access (by car, of course, this is LA after all) and navigation to Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Downtown and Santa Monica."

I picked this hotel for it's location and Tempur-Pedic beds, as I've read good things about these beds. After 3 nights, me, my bf and our 7 yr old son all had extremely sore backs. As for the location, we paid 45 bucks to get back from the Whiskey a Go-Go on the Sunset Strip. It was also quite far from Universal Studios. Drug store and Ralph's across the street, coffee shop a block away.The rest of the room however was wonderful. Very clean, decent tub, Rush toiletries, beautiful view of Bevery Hills and the Hollywood sign, nice furnishings, and big balcony!

A good deal for $170 per night.No restaurant on premises. The bar next to the tiny pool serves bar food though. If you are starving, try the Fish Grill in the small shopping mall across the street for fish tacos. One block down the street is a Coffee Bean shop. You'll need a cab/car for Rodeo Drive etc. Valet parking is $26/day."

When we arrived we were greeted at the front desk by a pretentious staff member who seemed extremely self absorbed. I did not have a good feeling from that moment on... When we got up to our room we were extremely disappointed. We had read the reviews on this site and I have picked many hotels based on it. This time I regretted it. The room was drab and almost dingy. It needed a serious facelift. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. We faced Pico Blvd and a strip mall. Considering this is an incredibly busy street we heard everything. Car horns, emergency vehicles, you name it. Another thing you should know before you book is the cost of parking. There is valet service only which costs $26 dollars a day!! It is not the money but the principle!!! I have been to Beverly Hills many times but this was the first and last time I will stay at this hotel."

I stayed here with my 2 teenage daughters who are celebrity  shopping obsessed  this proved a great base from which to indulge their obsessions being close to Rodeo Drive and a short drive or bus ride to Santa Monica in onde direction and Hollywood in the other. We didn't eat in the hotel but there are various places to eat nearby. The room was nice  had a great view from the balcony. We were on the quiet side of the hotel (not facing Pico Blvd) and we were able to use wifi with my laptop in the room but there are also desktop computers in a room off the reception area which are free to use for guests. Being a caffeine addict I was glad that the hotel had a coffee maker with supplies of coffee, though there is a coffee shop just around the corner if you prefer a capuccino first thing in the morning. All in all we had a good experience at this hotel. The one downside is that parking cost $26 a night, but apart from that we really enjoyed our stay here."

Huge room with enormous comfortable beds. We had a room with a balcony facing the HOLLYWOOD sign which was fabulous considering it was our first time in LA.We had a car and used the valet parking ($26/night) at the hotel. This is kind of non-optional as the hotel is in a residential area there is no on-street parking. We just paid it and enjoyed the service.Hotel is an easy drive to all the sights and shopping in Beverly Hills/Hollywood.Reception and concierge were super helpful and recommended some fabulous restaurant suggestions.

The best mattress, the best sleep I've ever had in a Hotel, despite being on the noisy side (Pico Avenue). Loved having a balcony and internet access in the room (for a fee of course) but well worth it. The pool is rather small but adequate, warm and clean. I would not recommend eating in the pub as the service is extremely slow. We ordered sandwiches and we waited 45 minutes for the food to get to our table. Room is good sized, nice bathroom, maid made sure we had new toiletries, coffee etc. every day. Staff all very friendly and helpful. We did not have a car, so relied on taxis, which I would not recommend as they are very expensive, instead use the limo service and make sure you ask for Vladimir - he is great. (not Boris). There are many restaurants nearby, a huge drugstore across the street where you can buy water, groceries etc. We would stay at this hotel again."

We even walked across the street to a store to buy ice cream at midnight! The staff is so friendly and are always helpful. The valet guys were also helpful as we had two cars and were trying to figure out where to park the other one, etc. One day, I went to the pool area to sit outside and work on my laptop in the sun. Ahhhh..... just lovely! And, the beds are super comfortable too! I would highly recommend this property to anyone who needs to stay in LA but doesn't want to deal with a huge mega-property.

The hotel does not have a sign, so it took several rounds of going around the block before finding it. The staff is extremely fake when pretending to be friendly and helpful. I had to give repeated instructions to the valet guy and the bellman about their own jobs. I would say the rooms are at most 2.5stars. The TV and the alarm clock did not work and when I called the staff about it expecting someone to come up and repair it, all I got was an insincere We're sorry, we don't have anyone available to fix them. I was shocked at the level of indifference and lack of professionalism. The breakfast was at best mediocre. We were told not so sit outside because it was going to be cleaned, which turned out to be a lie to cut down work for the staff. The only good feature of this hotel is its location. But there are several other hotels in the area with far better service.At first I thought this was general LA culture but after transferring to a different hotel, I realized that the horrible service was unique to the Orlando. Do not waste your money on this hotel."

There have been some comments about the dated bathrooms but ours seemed to be newly renovated so I would suggest asking for a room with a new bath. I would call the room decor Crate and Barrel, more contemporary than traditional.Loved the neighborhood! It was within walking distance of the Farmer's Market and the streets were filled with boutiques and many small, reasonably priced restaurants.I was pleasantly surprised that it had a (small) pool and fitness center, a free computer for use in the lobby and wireless access in the lounge.All in all, a good experience."

However...I was booked at the hotel last month and arrived late morning to drop off my bag then go about my day of business. When I arrived just after 9 following a business dinner and long day, I was told that because a couple of people didn't check out of the hotel, they didn't have a room for me.I was told that I had been booked in a Ramada 10 minutes away on Santa Monica Blvd. Hmmm. A Ramada on Santa Monica Blvd? This could be bad. Really bad. Turns out the room was fine and the hotel was on a decent part of SMB. Plus, The Orlando paid for the cab ride to the Ramada and paid for my room there. I've never had something like that happen to me in my career. However, it was disturbing that a man was checking into the hotel as they were wisking me out the door and into a cab. Why a room for him and not me when I was there first?Everyone deserves a second chance so I stayed there this weekend. Best part of the hotel is definitely the great proximity to shopping, both along Third Street and on Robertson."

I chose the Orlando as it was close to my meetings the next day and I like staying at small boutique hotels. The website is designed very well but unfortunately the hotel is not. This is essentially a refurbished hotel that is trying to be a boutique but I thought it was dark, shabby and uncomfortable. I was not expecting the Ritz Carlton but at $300 a night, a little more attention to detail and cleanliness would have been nice. The bed was uncomfortable, the bathroom was half-renovated and the entire place felt odd to me.

"Review_13129","hotel_165","hotel_7833","Jun 26, 2008","European Style in Beverly Hills So it was our son's 30th birthday last week and we were surprising him with a sumptuous surprise party. Therefore, we needed a place to stay out of his view. After much careful research only a marketing maven such as myself undergoes, I opted for the self-described small European style boutique Orlando Hotel. What a delightful gem in the middle of Beverly Hills!Arriving late into the evening, we drove up in our rental car to be greeted without any wait by friendly attendants. Upon entering, the lobby was awash in candlelight, as votives were lit on nearby tables. Check in was a breeze and before we knew it we were looking out over the surrounding area twinkling as only L.A. does.Service here, while California laid back, was excellent. We called down for extra sugar and creamer and it seemed he was waiting outside our door - it was so quick. In fact, our every request was met with courtesy and superb promptness. The room reminded me of the Swissotel in London. It was clean, modern, and with all the creature comforts including robes (heavy), slippers, in room coffee, hair dryers, and a very nice bathroom vanity which was supplied with Bulgari toiletries. The bed was plushly adorned and very comfortable and room service did a great job. In room TV is a wall mounted very large screen and local and national newspapers are available every morning. This place is intimate, modern, clean and delightful and worth every reasonable penny.Now for the best part - we booked our room at $299 a night for a king sized bed, which also included breakfast in thehotel restaurant downstairs. It's small and delicious with fresh fruits, eggs done-any-style and more. Parking was $26. Now even better - this was all in the heart of downtown Beverly Hills...so close you can walk to everything or take a very short drive to Melrose for even more fantabulous shopping which a good New York girl like me did!I highly recommend this jewel. At this price, with breakfast and reasonable parking rates, you are treated like a celebrity without the celebrity prices. Enjoy!"

This is a great hotel and a fabulous location. The room is large and very comfortable, the staff very helpful. (The valet managed to have our car ready for us in minutes each time we needed it.) The location is central for getting around LA, but the real highlight is that there are many fine restauarants and stores within walking distance. Our first day we dined at a Japanese place about 4 doors away that turned out to be one of the best meals of the trip. The nearby stores were some of the most interesting I've seen anywhere. I have stayed in Century City, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica in the past, but will return to the Orlando for my next trip."

The location was perfect -- lots in the neighbourhood within walking distance including excellent restaurants and shopping. The farmers market in The Grove was a nice find.

It started out as a luxury hotel.I loved the rooms, the staff, and the overall ambience of the property.This year, as in past years , my husband took me there for 2 nights for my birthday. They seemed to have changed their clientele from couples to families.At the pool, there was children screaming and running(with no supervision at all).Even when we went to the small beach that says ADULTS ONLY!-THERE WERE KIDS.I did tell the staff about it, but they didnt seem concerned. I still love Baleen, that is still very good food, and a really great vibe.We were there when Miami Spice was available(where you can get a 3 course dinner for a fraction of the cost normally.I told people about it that we met at the bar,but when we were seated, I had to ask the waiter for that special menu, as did the out of state couple who we met.If the hotel has changed its atmosphere and the people they want to attract, they can't bill itself as a romantic getaway.Unless your idea of a romantic weekend is a pool full of kids.I couldnt even speak to my husband without yelling.I love my own kids, but sometimes when you want to get away from it all-there is a time and place.I do hope they go back to the hotel I once loved.I'm sure there are other hotels around that fit my bill"

"Review_13143","hotel_166","hotel_8164","Jun 29, 2008","great hotel / poor food. My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary for 2 nights.The hotel itself is very nice, great balcony and view from our room. The rooms are nice but I would not rate them as 5 star. Possibly a 4 star at best. Mostly due to the bathroom which was tired and very simple. You would think there would be a jacuzzi or something special. It had one of those bath / shower combos that you would not expect in a 5 star hotel. It had a huge flat screen HD TV that had not been wired up for HD, so was terrible quality. It only had about 4 basic local channels anyway, that all seamed to be showing baseball all the time (Not good for a romantic getaway!). Even a Days-Inn has HBO. Everything else was pay per view, even the TV shows. Anyway, we didn't go there to watch TV, so not a big deal. The hotel location is really amazing with great views from everywhere. The pools, deck and bar area were very nice. It is part of a condo development so does have 3 or 4 large building behind the hotel but they don't seam to affect the view. I just thought I would mention that because the website gives the impression it is this little private hotel on an island.The staff were all exceptional. They were extremely friendly, professional and always knew my name. The Spa was fantastic. We had a couples massage that was worth every penny. I would definitely go back just for that. Now the bad news...The restaurant has to have one of the most romantic settings in Florida. Our table was on a wood deck, right on the bay. However they seam to have forgotten about the food. I made a point to call a week before our stay to say my wife was a vegetarian and was contacted back to confirm what she could eat. I was told that the chef would prepare something special. When I told our waiter, he said they have something amazing.WELL... she got a plate of veggies. 1/2 roasted 1/2 boiled. With no sauce or flavor of any type. Honestly, she could have got the same meal from Boston Market for about $4. The table next to us seamed to have some socialite, food critic or something because she had the attention of the chefs and food/Bav managers all night. At one point had 5 staff buzzing around her delivering little dishes of everything. They didn't seam to care too much about anyone else's food. Not wanting to complain and spoil our evening, I decided to just fill out the review card and leave. My fish was ok, but nothing special. Overall the dinner was very disappointing. I would not eat there again. Do yourself a favor and go eat at Nobu on South Beach instead. The next morning we ordered breakfast in bed. It took over an hour to come and was stone cold. We were too hungry to care (from the night before) so just ate it. One last complaint was the Coffee. The coffee in the room and the stuff we ordered with breakfast was truly disgusting. You would think that in a 5 star hotel, they would give you real milk/cream in your room, not that powdered creamer stuff. My overall opinion is that the hotel layout, location and staff are fantastic. However, the hotel is not what I expect a 5 star hotel to be. The food was very disappointingly."

The bathroom was on the small side with a cracked sink and faucets that were difficult to turn off and on. The room balcony had comfortable furniture but the noise from what I'm told was the air conditioning system made it unpleasant during the day--at night the system noise cut out. Speaking of noise, at 10:00 am Sunday morning, hotel maintenance decided to run some kind of equipment (possibly a leaf blower). Nobody who wanted to sleep in could do so without earplugs. Housekeeping showed up at a little after 3:00 pm--just when I returned to my room and was desperate for a shower.The pool deck had definitely seen better days but they had a nice adults only section with a view of Biscayne Bay. They also had circulating staff offering free ice water and frozen grapes--a nice touch. Hotel offers tennis and spa services which I didn't use but their fitness center was clean and well equipped.The island itself is rather nice with a walkway along the seawall which ends in a tiny beach. A young boy was fishing in front of the hotel restaurant and actually catching small snappers which he threw back.Reception staff was very nice and even let me stay in my room an hour past check out."
"Review_13145","hotel_166","hotel_6583","Apr 21, 2008","Overpriced, Understaffed, Well-seasoned travelers know that Miami is notorious for their poor levels of service so I'm not going to disparage Grove Isle in that regard. Its level of service is on par with what you'll get anywhere else in the area (from the Delano to the Loews to The Setai.)My only complaint is that the rooms are a terrible value. I stayed here for almost a week due to a friend's wedding. My rate for a room facing the bay with a balcony was almost $600/night. There is no beach at this resort. Housekeeping frequently didn't make up our room until dinnertime. The service at the restaurants was absurdly slow. The pool is decent but the seating gets filled up quickly. Spa treatment and tennis lessons booked in advance were cancelled by the resort without advance notice. They always seemed to have an excuse for everything. For the same price, I should have stayed at the Four Seasons or The Mandarin Oriental, and then just driven over to Grove Isle for the wedding events. Never again. P.S. Don't believe the photos on the website. They make it seem as if the resort is on a private island. In fact, the layout is very strange. Although it is an island, it's also a massive condo development encompassing several enormous high-rises. Many of the resort facilities (like tennis) are actually shared with the condos."

The hospitality and service by the staff is at the highest level. Check in was extremely smooth-using a wireless device in our room. Our room had a great water view, excellent balcony for relaxation. We also had a seating area and flat screen TV. Housekeeping was excellent-we are water drinkers and requested 6 bottle of house water each day-no problem. The only issue we had was the backup alarms from the delivery trucks. This sound seems amplified by the shape of the hotel-very distracting in our room.The hotel never seems crowded; this could be because of the extensive security required to enter the island as the hotel shares Grove Isle with three large buildings of condos.While there is a Spa and exercise facility, my wife swam laps in the outside pool each morning and I walked into Coconut Grove and back-50 minutes.We had breakfast each day in the hotel and it was nice, good selection and good service. However we found some great restaurants near by. First in Coral Gables, 15 minutes away is La Dorado-great fish. Then for authentic Cuban food, we loved Las Culebrinas, 2890 SW 27th Ave-also 15 minutes away. We were one of the few Anglos there-food is great. Then for lunch, best Cuban sandwich ever-Villa Habana at 34th and Coral Way-again authentic.On our next visit, we play to stay at Grove Isle."

This hotel is good if you need a room 5 minutes away from the airport. We slept very well and did not hear an airplane. The free shuttle of the hotel works very good. You don't have to give a phonecall on arrival, because every 30 minutes the shuttle goes to the airport for pickup, excepted some hours in the middle of the night. In the morning we had to go to the office of Avis for pick up of our hired car, and the shuttle brought us to the entrance of the office, so very convenient. The room itself was clean enough, but does not look as nice as on the pictures on internet. In the corners were some big holes in the wall and the bathroom lacks some finishing touch. There is no coffeemaker in the room. Breakfast has little choice, but enough to start the day and there is a nice terrace at the breakfast area, so you can take the breakfast outside if you like.

No big whoop and really, who needs a fancy shmancy place to lay his head anyway?It's not exactly a destination point now is it?For me..just a stop between home and the Caribbean.I had a good time swimming and laying in the sun.I walked over to a fast food joint which served interesting Caribbean fare.I also walked to a nearby gas station for snacks and drinks.I found my 2 days there to be pretty relaxing.The desk clerks were friendly and helpful.All in all it was a good stay at the Red Roof Inn. Dig it!As a matter of fact, I will be staying there again this December.So, I say go ahead stay there and remember 'A good attitude goes a long way'.Satisfied guest."
"Review_13151","hotel_167","hotel_5192","Oct 19, 2008","Dirty, Filthy Flea Bay of a Hotel Booked this hotel for a pre-cruise stay for our group of 52 people. Our travel agent suggested this hotel as reasonably priced. IT WAS AWFUL. We had quite a bit of luggage for our cruise and only one elevator was operable. The rooms were gross. They smelled nasty and were dirty. No hair dryer either so a lot of our party looked a bit different the next day. Bennigan's next door was o.k. Shady characters hanging around.Continental breakfast was pretty much non-existent. Coffee and juice machines were empty or broken. The few muffins that were put out were pre-packaged frozen muffins. Those were gone so early because they probably put out a dozen and that was it. I specifically checked on the availability of the shuttle service to the port since our group was large. They told us it would be no problem and that we should be ready at the pool at 11:00. Only 12 or so people could go on each shuttle trip and there was only one bus. By the way, the bus had a flat tire and the driver drove us all around town to try and fill up the tire. We were the first group to go to the pier. The rest of our group had to wait almost 3 hours to get the pier. The bathroom in the lobby ran out of toilet paper and these poor people had to sit out in the hot Miami sun for a long time with no water or anything. It was a joke.I called the general manager of the hotel when we returned from our cruise. He denied any problems with the hotel. After months of wrangling with the general manager and the corporate office, we were able to get a refund for all of our group members.Very poor service and dirty rooms. Never, never, never would I stay here again nor would I suggest it for even one night."

We never did get a room key, they would have to walk us to the room and open the door. The room was not very clean. We only had 1 towel, and we were not able to get more until the next morning when housekeeping got there @9:00. We also ran out of toliet paper (before housekeeping got there) and asked the front desk for more and they told us to use the bathroom in the lobby. The shuttle list for the cruise was very long and they only had 1 shuttle, so the wait was a while. We took a cab. The coffee machine which made regular coffee (not flavored) was not working. I will never stay here again. We brought this to their attention, but they were not interested in helping us at all. Many other guest were complaining also."

The first room was filthy with dirty sheets on one bed. I asked for fresh sheets and the clerk had the security guard watch the desk while he ran them to me. I stripped the sheets and found that the mattress pad beneath was stained all over and the bed was broken and lopsided with an old, dirty, sagging mattress. The carpets were dirty and the walls ewre marked with stains on the upholstry and carpets. I asked for a new room and he obliged. The next room was similar but not as bad. One bed was sagging and unmistakingly broken. The property in general is run down with dirty, unvacuumed flooring, pizza fliers littering the halls and insides of rooms where they have been shoved under doors. The doors slam all night as there are no door stoppers and it is noisy. Based on the price and other comparably priced satisfactory hotels in the area one would expect a much higher standard of service or at least a clean room!!!"

It was just hard to communicate some things I was trying to say exactly, but got the overall message across.Also the continental breakfast was doughnuts, muffins, and apples. They also had coffee and hot chocolate.Besides that it was a good overall experience and for only staying one night for a grad interview, it was everything I expected.I would stay there again."

We had good luck w/ the shuttle from the airport, but the line for the port was very long; we opted for a taxi.I noticed that some people were able to pay $85 for a night here. That sounds about right for the experience. Unfortunately, we paid $180 for the Saturday night of Presidents' Day weekend; the hotel certainly isn't worth that. Benningan's is right next door and serves good food, although their signature sandwich, the Monte Cristo, really can't be finished by anyone who's not a glutton. Good for transients, but you wouldn't want to spend more than a night here."

One of the friendly staff recommended a cuban cafe a block away to get some really good sandwiches. Pool area really noisy with airplanes flying over, but couldn't hear them from the room."
"Review_13157","hotel_167","hotel_4019","Feb 9, 2008","online-booking in vain I booked the Red Roof Inn via RatesToGo, because they offered a real good rate. A deposit was paid by credit card, I got a mail from HotelClub confirming the reservation with a booking ID. The rest of the money should be paid directly at the hotel. When I arrived at the Red Roof Inn they couldn't find anything about my reservation. I showed them the mail from HotelClub I had printed out but it was rejected - quite unfriendly - with the wonderful argument a booking ID is no confirmation. I had no time to look for another hotel so I took one of the last available rooms which of course had to be paid in full and at a much higher rate.The room was clean and simple and would have been absolutely okay for the rate that went with my booking - but not for the price I finally had to accept. Maybe the problem was not caused by the hotel, but still their handling of the whole thing was pretty poor.PS: It's more than 2 months now, but I'm still trying to get the deposit back."

We arrived to stay the night in Miami before flying to the Carribean. We chose Red Roof Inn because it was 5 minutes from the airport. The ONLY good thing about it! When we checked in, they gave us a room that was 50 degrees in it! I'm talking, the AC was on full blast turned to dark blue cold! They switched us to another which wasn't really better. We asked for a non-smoking room, but there was a muggy, stale smoking odor in the room anyway. The shower  tub was in bad condition, leaky  rusty. Hot water didn't work very good. We worried about sleeping in the bed, wondering if the sheets  covers were clean because there were women in the hallways trying to get customers (meaning prostitution). When we walked past 2 rooms on our floor, the smell of marijuana filled the hallway. The entire night we did not sleep. There was loud noise from the pool area, loud noise up  downstairs, the room's smokey odor made it hard for me to breath while I TRIED to sleep (cause I have astmha) and it was pretty much a nightmare. We even heard the front desk people chattering to eachother, using profanities while we were walking our 3 year old out the door. Totally unprofessional  a total SLUM is the word.

I am a Mariott member and also Starwoods member. I travel a lot and prefer Mariott, but after this incident this time, I am never going to stay in their property and also recommend others not to.I had to park the car in their garage parking and had to pay 24 bucks per day but there is no security, someone broke the window glass and stole all my belongings from the Car and Mariott claims to be not liable for any of these.They say they cannot take care of any criminal act..The stay was also not comfortable because its an old property, water leakage all over and then my head still ringing from the heavy construction noise. Its a terrible hotel.If the brand cannot maintain its properties, I wont ever go to this brand.I would also log this complaint with my employer who has thousands and thousands of employees travelling everyday to Mariott because of Corporate tie up.If there is no security and comfort, then what makes it different from a roadside Motel?"
"Review_13165","hotel_168","hotel_6970","Nov 23, 2008","Not a relaxing stay Overall this was a very underwhelming experience for a Marriott.The hotel is undergoing a significant refit internally and externally and there is constant noise and drilling from 9 to 5 Monday through to Saturday. There is no warning of this on the hotel's website and it came as a shock upon arrival.Got a nice room on a high floor only to discover that due to the construction the window was covered in muck and a struggle to see out across the bay. The restaurant service was poor and abrupt. This again was a disappointment compared to the many Marriotts that I have stayed in. The lounge is small and not anything special. The only redeeming point was the location, the comfortable rooms and a nice pool area with quiet areas to relax (but only on a Sunday).However overall this place is one to avoid for the next few months until the work has finished."

The hotel overall was a bit dated including the pool area, however the views are out of this world  it's only a short taxi ride over to South Beach. Service across the board was friendly  efficient. Everything was super clean, bed was awesome blah blah... typical nice experience stuff. The only bad parts were that they don't offer 24 hour room service  after reading all the pizza hut pizza options to be delivered before 11pm via room service it turned into torture! In addition, the balcony railing was to say the least not secure.

It also had a sliding door leading outside that didn't work, and an extremely small bathroom. In spite of the room, the hotel staff were all very nice and helpful.

"Review_13169","hotel_168","hotel_6902","Oct 24, 2008","A Wonderful Experience!!! WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE! My wife and I had booked a 4 day cruise to celebate our 25th anniversary and were looking for a hotel close to the Port of Miami. We planned our flight into Miami the day before the cruise to relax and celebrate without having the hassle of rushing from the airport to the cruise ship.When we checked in, a very courteous staff member welcomed us to the hotel and asked if we needed anything special. We asked if she could recommend a nice place to have a dinner to celebrate our 25th anniversary. She smiled, congratulated us and set up a contact with the concierge to arrange a dinner for us. She also set us up with a free breakfast buffet on the 30th floor for the following morning. Our room was on the 22nd floor. The room was wonderful, newly redecorated with a large flat panel TV, a controllable digital thermostat, a very comfortable bed and a great view overlooking the arena and the port of Miami where we could see our cruise ship dock the following morning.Five minutes after arriving at the room, there was a knock on the door. Imagine our surprise when we found out the hotel had arranged for room service to bring us a complementary tray containing a chilled bottle of sparkling wine, a bowl for large, fresh strawberries, some chocolate sauce, whipped cream and flowers to help us celebrate. What a thoughtful gesture this was!There were some areas of the hotel that are still under rennovation and were closed. The pool was being serviced but the hotel had arranged for us to use the pool at the adjacent hotel and appologized for the inconvenience. Even with the remodelling, the hotel arranged for any work to start after 9am so as not to disturb the guests.We would definitely stay there again. The location is great, many restaurants close by (we didn't have a chance to eat at the hotel but it looked very nice) and the price was around $150 using our Marriott rewards card - similar rates for AAA and some other deals. One of the best night's we have spent away from home!"
"Review_13170","hotel_168","hotel_3786","Oct 17, 2008","Good Location and Quality Stayed at the Marriott for two nights and was quite happy with that stay.The room was nicely renovated with the very comfortable Marriott bedding package, new furnishings and a huge flat screen TV with the new plug-in panel. Very nice idea Marriott came up with there - making it easy to connect your MP3 to the TV to enjoy your own music. The room offered a small balcony and some good though partial views of the Biscayne Bay.Service seemed efficient and up to Marriott standards. Easy check-in and check-out with friendly staff. I did not try the restaurant on site - but there is one if you need it. There also is a very nice little Deli with good take-away right next door in the Doubletree hotel - directly connected to the Marriott. Otherwise the public areas seemed rather unimpressive. The location was very good - only a short cab ride or drive from downtown and bayside as well as Miami Beach. The area directly around the hotel though I found to be rather drab and nowhere I would really like to walk around. Overall quite nice with nicely renovated rooms and not far from anything but certainly not directly in the best neighbourhood so that you need to drive everywhere."

The view from the window was stunning, as it looked out over the bay; no balcony (although I hear there are balconies on the other side of the building). We stayed 4 to a room, and found that we were not too over-crowded as the room was large and had two double beds as well as chairs, desk etc. Bathroom was clean, and it was all tidied daily.The food was adequate; despite having to pay extra for it. It was not the cheapest I've ever had but it was nice food. The waiter service was poor; we were left waiting to order for a long time each morning. The location is fine - closer to the centre would be nice, but we had a hire car so it did not matter to us. However, the cost of parking there is ridiculously high. If you go without a car, apparently there is a good train system nearby which can get you anywhere you need to go."

Our room was located on the 30th floor; the derco was very inviting, the flat screen TV and bathroom, made the stay more pleasurable. And the VIEW from the sliding door balcony, over looked the bay, Port of Miami was more that we expected. We had a clear view of the cruise ships and all of Downtown/ South Beach area. We wanted steak for lunch and the bellman suggested a great resturant in the strip maill on the first floor near the Doubletree hotel.

The hotel interior looks a little dated (lobby, corridors etc.) but the rooms were decorated to usual marriott standard. Managed to get a move to a room facing the bay on 26th floor and the views were of course amazing. Staff were friendly enough though I found that the restaurant staff were very obsessed with making sure they got the 'right' gratuity. I know gratuities are important n the US but here they seemed overly concerned with this.We used the pool once as well and it was fine, though a little cold. I was a bit annoyed that over the weekend they closed the club lounge (I'm a Marriott elite member so this provides me and my family with free breakfast/snacks). This struck me as an unnecessarily cheap thing to do. When I complained I was give some breakfast vouchers but had I not done so I wouldnt have had any. Didnt expect to have to pay 25 USD to park per day (actually I paid 28 for lobby parking) but there is little in the way of competeng parking nearby and that which is available is same price. So overall it was fine - Marriott's usually are - and it wouldnt be a disaster to stay there again with my familly - but i'd probably look elsewhere first"

It is about 2 miles from the port. The lobby and front reception area is very clean and well cared for. Valet and baggage assistance is hit or miss but efficient overall. Rooms: Rooms are very nice and I recommend you ask for a room with a balcony facing the cruise port. Allthough most of the rooms have side views of Biscayne Bay on both sides of the hotel you have either high rise residential condos or the doubletree on the north side. Some of the rooms have the strange entry configuration and the bathrooms are small for Marriott standards. Room Service/Restaurant: Geez what can I say? This department is incredibly lacking in both efficiency and anything else for that matter. Ordered 2 Cuban Sandwiches and 2 orders of Fried Plaintains. Took 1 hour 20 minutes. Cuban Sandwiches are pretty simple to make and authentic cuban sandwiches even don't take over an hour to make. When she finally arrived she practically wiped out my laptop and just wisked passport and papers right off the table to make room for the tray. (Another one of those Marriotts that don't believe in leaving the guests anything to eat off except those ackward trays. She was pretty taken back about my discontent about my documents and my laptop being whisked off the table like it was no problem to just disconnect my laptop from the internet without even asking or even providing a response to my 3 repeated requests for the table to eat on. I spoke to another guest in the elevator on the way up from the lobby and they said that they had pretty horrible service in the restaurant. At the time of the review I ordered 2 Cookies and Creams Ice Creams over 40 minutes ago!!! Definetly up to the Marriott standard of service in regards to the Food and Beverage Department. Would I stay here again? Probably not, unless going out of the port of miami again on another cruise, and even then I would eat out somewhere instead of trusting this hotel to ever deliver what the Marriott name has come to mean to a Marriott loyalist."

As a bonus, I had to re-start my computer three times ... just what a business traveler wants. Staff not helpful. Asking for a drug store, the concierge sent me blocks away in a taxi, only to later find out that there is a pharmacy in the shopping area attached to the hotel. The room ... standard, but my non-smoking room had been smoked in and I ran out of toilet paper. Used the laundry service, and got my underwear back squished into a ball, all rumpled and still damp. And the caper ... I watched a movie, or tried to. Halfway through, I used the pause function. After a short while, the movie disappeared from my screen, and I was given these choices: Start over, or let it be and get a 10% discount. Ah, after protesting, I also got an apology and the discount was increased to 20%. This place isn't worthy of the Marriott name."

The built in wall air conditionerwas making a loud knocking sound, as was the refridgeratorhumming. I called the desk and they sent up 2 maintence mento fix them, which took 2 hrs. I dont feel this should have beendone on MY vacation time. No other room was available nor offered to us to change. Heard noise ALL night long from other partying guests till3am. The bathroom was very small and outdated.The pool was small and guests were smoking. If this is a nonsmoking hotel, why are people smoking at the pool?The attendant messed up our lunch order and seemed MADwhen he was told about it, tried to blame it on us.Tried to get info at the concerige on what to do in Miami, but she was busydirecting the incoming traffic of guests in the lobby. NO help at all. Not at her desk doing her job. Would not stay at thishotel again."
"Review_13190","hotel_168","hotel_3316","Feb 29, 2008","Disappointing - not recommended Well this is supposed to be a full service Marriott (with prices to match). I stayed for 3 nights with a convention. Notes:1. Location is not great. Its nice on the bay but there is very little in walking distance.2. Pool area is not particularly pleasant. Its kind of squashed in and the Doubletree next door looked much nicer. 3. The gym is small pokey and on three floors and, for the 1st time in many years, I opted to go jogging rather than use the gym. My knees still hurt!4. The Internet didn't work in my initial room. It took a couple of hours messing around to get to the point. The hotel changed my room efficiently but it was hassle.5. My new room had some stuff wrong but I couldn't be bothered to report it.Its fine for a conference or a quick stay but its not up to normal Marriott standards."
"Review_13191","hotel_168","hotel_8558","Feb 26, 2008","Not up to Marriott standards! I'm a Marriott snob and I was highly disappointed by this hotel. My wife and I stayed here February 22-24, 2008 because we were in town for the South Beach Wine  Food Fest. We try to stay at Marriott's whenever we travel based on our past positive experiences and their reputation. This was the worst Marriott we have ever stayed at.As we arrived, we entered the parking garage which was disgusting. I know it's a parking garage but it smelled like it belonged in NYC (no offense). The parking garaged was disgustingly dirty. I know it's a parking garage but at least paint the walls so they don't look so gross. The elevator and it's fixtures were also outdated, smelled, and were dirty.The lobby seemed nice, the hotel appears to be a layover hotel for cruise guests, airline employees, or business persons for conferences at the hotel. I couldn't imagine anyone staying here for vacation. The check-in was quick and we were upgraded to a bay view from a city view.The bay view was gorgeous however I don't quite understand why all other rooms that were not bay view rooms had a nice little deck. The bay view rooms have a sliding glass door that leads out to a 3 inch faux balcony. This was kinda disappointing.The room was also pretty nasty. The carpet was old and crusty and I actually walked around with sandals on which I never do. The television was outdated, no flatscreen here. The walls probably got pained over a couple years ago and look fine. There was nice crown molding by the sliding doors which was a nice touch. Now comes the bathroom from the 70's. The tile was old and not very nice. The bathroom and tub were also not very nice.Pool was nice and heated, hot tub was good too. I'm sorry but not a nice Marriott"
"Review_13192","hotel_168","hotel_9604","Feb 17, 2008","Great Pre/Post Cruise Hotel I enjoyed being able to see the cruise ships come and go from my room before my cruise. It really got me psyched and also a bit more prepared.My room request recommendation would be for a room WITH a full balcony (w/table and chairs) on the cruise terminal side of the hotel as close to the water as possible on a high floor. Note: the rooms with the most expansive bay views - - which the hotel charges more for -- do NOT have balconies....although they have a sliding glass door opening onto a tiny railed-in ledge and those views are indeed the best.The hotel was very accomodating to my need for any early check-in (10am) after my cruise, and a staff member told me that they try to be very responsive to this.Finally, they have a self serve laundry for guests and a business center with pay internet access."

The hotel is located right by the port and the transportation to the port the following morning was easy. The guest rooms were nice and our room overlooked the bay/ports. Bed was comfortable. I really enjoyed watching the sunrise in the morning. We also ate dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and found the service to be lacking and the food was average (it was dead that night). Went again for breakfast and found that the service was a better and food was good."

"Review_13197","hotel_168","hotel_1567","Jan 29, 2008","Great pre-cruise stay We stayed here for one night post cruise and found it more than adquate. Upon check in a lovely staff member took it upon himself to ensure we had a port view which was awesome and really got us excited for the next day. All the staff were friendly and answered any queries. Went to Bayside for dinner which was fun but didn't use hotel restuarants at all so comment. After a great nights sleep we checked out at 10.30 and caught a taxi to the port. We were sitting down to lunch on the ship and 12.15pm. Very convenient and more than adequate for a pre-cruise night. Warning we had to return a hire care and ended up in some pretty scary neighbourhoods where we had to fill up with petrol. Would not stray to far from port area or hotel at this end of town but as I said we just wanted a good comfortable nights rest before boarding the ship. Would recommend this hotel for cruisers. Having travelled through USA for a few weeks this was definitely one of the better hotels as far as decor not nearly as bad as people try to make you think."

We had come from orlando ( theme parks etc ) and the comfortable beds of the Marriott were very welcoming.The location is very easy for South Beach and the Bayside area very near the hotel was great. Bayside has all the chain eateries inc chilis, bubba's and hard rock cafe, to name but a few.We have stayed at this hotel before and we would stay here again. Ok it may be getting a little tired but the comfort and staff certainly make up for that."

"Review_13200","hotel_168","hotel_2258","Jan 9, 2008","great hotel I truly cannot understand what in the world people are complaining about. I can tell you that I was told that the hotel is going to undergo a major renovation in the next few months for all of you who have complained about the decor. We stayed here pre and post cruise. We had a very, very comfortable stay. The bed was plush. The bathroom is definitely small and looked old, but it was nothing that concerned us. Each morning we woke up to this incredible view of the harbor and port. I cannot even begin to explain how beautiful this view is. There is one restaurant on property. We had dinner there and thought that the food was very good. We also ordered room service and it was promptly delivered and tasted delicious. We had concierge access which is on the 26th floor. The view from this room is also incredible and panoramic. The balcony in our room on both occasions opened up. You cannot sit out there, but at least you can open it up for fresh air. Every staff member from the bellmen to the front desk to housekeeping and everyone else in between were so nice and polite. Across from the hotel is the old omni mall which was shut down about 10 yrs ago. There are huge plans to reopen the mall with target and other stores. The amount of building going on in the area is astounding. The hotel is right next to a doubletree, so it is easy to get it confused if you are driving from the airport. The signage from the street is not very clear. At one point our taxi driver when we returned from our cruise wasn't even sure if it was the right driveway. You will see what i mean if you go.... Make sure you get exact directions written down from the internet and take them with you before you get behind that wheel. I am really good with directions and actually ended up lost for a few minutes because i forgot my internet directions from the hotel's website and was relying on what the hotel was trying to explain to me. They were explaining correctly, but i was on a long flight and got turned around. The hotel's interior did look older, but that did not distract from us from having a very relaxing, quiet and uneventful stay. The bed itself was extremely comfortable. The hotel is on a small dock at the marina. It is nice walking out there. There are also tables to sit and enjoy the view. There is also a little place downstairs that sells quick food items. We did take a look at the pool and spa. They both looked nice, but we did not have time to use them. I am sure that if you got a room and it smelled, the hotel would change your room. Plus, you can open the balcony door for fresh air which i thought was great. I would recommend this hotel in a second. I cruise a lot out of miami and will definitely return when i am there again."

"Review_13204","hotel_169","hotel_2312","Dec 24, 2008","Great hotel I stayed at Newport Beachside with my husband in the first 3 days of December before our Globus tour to Brazil. I can say it was a wonderful experience. I booked the hotel on its own site only 4 days before the check-in date and we saved a lot. It is a very nice hotel where you have the great caribbean vacation feeling: pool with music and a bar, beach towels and chairs, little huts on the beach, even an activities schedule you receive with your room keys. We had a one bedroom ocean view and it was exactly as described on the hotel's site. The room was very clean and the maids do a wonderful job to accomplish this.You have a choice of self parking ($10 a day) in a multi level parking lot across the street or valet parking on hotel's grounds ($15 a day) which was presented to us when we checked in. The big plus of this hotel is its people. Everybody is very nice and accomodating trying to make your stay as pleasent as possible. We had an absolutely amazing experience with the service of Patricio X Rosas, the Chief Concierge of the hotel who made possible our trip to Brazil and Argentina. In the morning of the day of our flight to Brazil he offered to confirm our names on the flight list with TAM (the Brazilian airline). We were horified to find out that we were not on the flight. He made so many phone calls for us to Globus Tours in Toronto, to my travel agent in Toronto, to the airport in Miami until at about 2:30 pm when we finaly found out we were put on the flight.He saved our vacation and we are very grateful to him for this. We did not meet before an employee in the tourism business so determined on helping two of his hotel's guests to pozitively rezolve such a nasty problem. We are very greatful to you Patricio! Next time we will be in Miami we will definetly stay at this hotel.I cannot coment on the restaurant because we did not eat there. We found restaurants in the plaza across from the hotel and the one one block north where there is a small supermarket as well."

"Review_13206","hotel_169","hotel_7446","Dec 16, 2008","Dirty and Not a Family Holiday Destination Had we not already paid up front to stay at this hotel I would not be writing this review because we would not have stayed. We arrived planning to have a great family holiday but it really was a disaster. The first room we were shown was disgusting. There was a hole in the wall in the bedroom where the door handle hit it. There were burn marks on the sofa and the toilet seat. Something had been spilled on the night table in the bedroom but it was never cleaned properly so it was sticky. I don't believe a vacumn cleaner has ever been run along the edge where the carpet meets the walls. The most disgusting thing however was the huge hair ball in the bathtub. There was no plug so it was easy to see! Overall, the room was moldy smelling and the bedding was, for lack of a better word, moist. Upon complaining they gave us another room which was equally dirty. After further complaining we were given a renovated room on the tenth floor which appeard to be cleaner than anything else we had seen so we agreed to stay. Even so, I wasn't happy because we ended up with a hotel room with a pull-out couch for our two children, when initially we had booked a suite to accommodate us all. We spent a week in a very cramped environment. Given the fact the rooms were so incredibly filthy, we refused to even consider eating at the hotel. We settled for cereal breakfasts and sandwich lunches we prepared ourselves, and we ate dinner at local restaurants (be prepared to drive). As for drinks, we bought our own alchohol and prepared drinks in our room. A bloody mary at the bar cost almost $8 US dollars so unless you have unlimited spending money plan to make your own drinks. The lobby was fine but outdated and the furniture not exactly clean. I made sure not to sit on the seats once I was dressed for dinnner. We were charged $10 a day for parking, and we had to park across the street (an extremely busy street I might add...). I don't think the place warranted charging guests to park. In addition there was a $10 per day 'activity' fee which we could have done without paying. I could have done without the pool-side singer who sang the exact same songs every day at the exact same time in the exact same droning voice. I assume other costs the 'activity' fee covered were related to the resort-type activities they offered (i.e. bingo, kids games, etc.). Again, I could have done without them as this was not a resort hotel from my perspective. To be fair to the hotel, there was one positive. The pool was kept very clean and it was heated (which it needed to be given the fact we were there in December). They had just purchased and put out all brand new lounge chairs and they were in the final stages of finishing a new outdoor pool-side bar and eating area. It was obvious where the money was being spent to upgrade this facility. Just to put this in perspective so you don't think we're a family of prima donnas...I have travelled all over the world, including backpacking trips through Europe and Asia. I am a professional who travels often for my job. I have stayed in literally hundreds of hotels over the years. Sorry - but I have to say this was the dirtiest hotel I've ever stayed at. I would not consider going back unless the place was gutted and cleaned from the bottom up!"

I was concerned w/the Newport Beachside reviews that I had read, but I also did not want to break the bank for a hotel room in Miami. The front appearance and lobby are LOVELY. The customer service, TOP NOTCH! Everyone was friendly. When we arrived to our room (pool/beach view w/jacuzzi tub) i was not real thrilled w/the room. There was a picture online that showed the jacuzzi tub in a corner, really big, and so my husband went down the the check-in desk and expressed our dissapointment and upgraded us at no charge to the king suite w/the big tub. I was really impressed that they were so accomodating. The room itself is dated, or I like to think they are halfway through renovations. The bathrooms were wonderful, large new tile, new updated glass doors, BIG jacuzzi tub, it was wonderful. The towels were fluffy and all the products in the room were Bath  Body. The bed was surprisingly comfy and I just wish they would have updated the room furniture to go w/the bed. Maybe they are, and maybe they are just in the middle of renovating. It was to windy for us to enjoy the beach or pool, but they had a nice outside bar and wonderful huts your could have rented on the beach. Overall a nice and relaxing weekend!"
"Review_13211","hotel_169","hotel_1708","Nov 19, 2008","Newport Beachside: The Negatives Addressed! Okay, here's the real deal on Newport Beachside if you plan on staying. First off ... some of you folks visiting need to seriously relax. Some of the complaints here are ridiculous! So rather than talk about how great it was I'll try to address the negatives from some of the recent reviews. 1) $10 resort fee - Yes, they do disclose it on a paper they give you. The fee goes towards beach chairs, various activities (bingo, children games) and other things to make your stay more enjoyable. Personally I think hidden fees are wrong but I have no complaints since staff readily helped out with beach chairs and the activities were fun.2) Room - Ours was fine. I don't understand folks saying it's outdated. But I didn't see all the rooms so I'm assuming they're similar to an extent. Everything worked just fine except for our safe which had an electronic problem. They replaced it with another one though it did take about 45 minutes. We needed extra blankets, pillows and coffee and it was handled with no problems. 3) Staff - Very friendly and cooperative. My guess is that some guests can be pushy and deserve what they get. Staff outside especially at the pool bar were very polite. 4) Seaweed on Beach: There were some spots in the water that had more than others but no problem. Water was great. Seaweed on the beach was here and there. No big deal.5) Trash on Beach: This is Miami folks. Your going to have stuff around. But it's not bad at all. And if you see some ... PICK IT UP AND THROW IT IN THE TRASH BIN 5 FEET AWAY! Don't be ignorant and complain, complain, complain. TAKE ACTION!Overall it was a nice place and I'd consider it again. The pool was always heated, the jacuzzi always hot, the live music (to some extent) was pleasant, the beach was gorgeous, the drinks were cold, out daughter had fun playing the resort games ... what more do you want. You can always find a more expensive place but this one fit our budget and more."

We traveled with another couple and their 3-year-old daughter. Check in was a breeze! The first night we were there we called the front desk for more pillows. Housekeeping came up with them within 15 minutes.Our 2 bedroom suite was great. It was very clean. We had a living room with a pull out bed, a TV, a fridge and microwave. Both bedrooms had a king-size bed and TV with a separate balcony. The bathroom was nice with a Jacuzzi tub. We always had plenty of towels even with 5 of us in the room.The pool was nice and the kiddie pool was great for the 3 year old. They had activities by the pool all day long for both adults and kids. They were retiling the deck while we were there so space was limited but it still wasn't crowded at all.The beach was beautiful! The tiki huts were great for $30 a day if you wanted some shade. Otherwise, chairs and towels were included in your $10/day resort fee. The beach was raked every morning so there wasn't too much seaweed build up.We rented a car and chose to use the valet parking ($15/day) rather than the self parking ($10/day) that was across the street from the hotel. The valets were very friendly and it was a great service to have.There are a few things to do within walking distance but I was glad we had a car. The concierge was very knowledgeable about the area and gave us some great recommendations for both food and fun!"
"Review_13213","hotel_169","hotel_7927","Nov 5, 2008","Newport Beachside-- Nice but... This is a fabulously located hotel in north Miami beach but the guest services and maintenance stinks! Immediately upon entering our room we called because the bathroom sink did not drain (plunger stuck in down position). Maintenance fixed it by making it stick in the up position about an 1/8th of an inch open so it drained every so slowly but the drain could not be closed (had to put a towel in the sink when inserting or removing contacts). 2)Two hours into checkin, I went to the desk to report that the toilet would barely flush  it took 3 sometimes four flushes just to get a decent clearing of the bowl. This issue was never resolved although I called a 2nd  3rd time. 3)Day two-- asked the front desk to have the bedspread changed since it was shredded on the underside and the fluff was everywhere. Upon return to the room, this was not cared for and the bed looked like someone had pounced on top after it had been made plus the tub  sink had not been cleaned. Nor was the toilet fixed. I called house cleaning  spoke with the supervisor who was beligerent, asking if I was sure that I wasn't a timeshare then INSISTING that I was a timeshare tenant. That was my last straw and finally I got ugly, calling again, the front desk this time, in a huff. Upon returning that evening, the shredded bedspread was still on although it was neat,the sink and tub were clean and we had ample towels  replinshed coffee (for a change). Still, the toilet was up to a minimum of 4 flushes per single use. This was our 1st first anniversary and we'd brought 10 others with us for a total of 8 rooms. And as beautiful as the location and lobby were, we'd planned to make Newport Beach Resort our Florida meeting spot going forward... however, we'll keep looking cuz this was not my idea of fun (especially when the compensation for this nitemare was an oh I'm sorry, I'll deduct the resort fee ($10)! Thanks but no thanks-- there are too many beautiful hotels next door."

The lobby looks marvelous and that's about it. Fridge in room is nice and tiled sink/bar area. Crib was brought promptly to the room. At the pool, they had a resort guy, sort of like a cruise director who ran games and contests throughout the day.Bad: Fees- there's a $10 per day resort fee which they do not disclose. However, since we booked on travelocity the fee was included in the price. There's also $10 self parking and $15 for valet. The self parking is across the street so when we first pulled up to the hotel we were in a sense forced to use valet as they came up to the car and started helping us.The room was totally outdated. Upon arrival I felt a wet spot on the carpet. The next morning I realized the A/C vent was dripping and there was rust on the meal door frame where the water was beading. The maintenance was called and they attributed it to condensation and said we could switch rooms. It also rained really hard, and at 3 in the morning had to get towels to put in the window sill as window dripping. The maids only took out garbage, made bed, and replaced towels every few days. They never vaccumed the entire 7 days we were there or cleaned the dinette."

When they did answer they re connected me to 3 different people and I still didnt get the pillows. I then called the front desk again and told them not to re direct my call and to plz bring 2 more pillows, I finally did receive them later that nite. The carpet in the hall way is in need of a shampoo. Very dirty, there were food particles that were never vacummed the entire 3 days we were there. There is a unpleasant smell in the hallways as well. The room is totally outdated. The ceiling in the bathroom has been patched and is still coming down. There is rust and one of the doors on the sink counter was hanging on by one hinge. Tried to use the fitness center , the bike, elliptic and stair master did not work. There was a terrible odor in the basement where the fitness center was located. Found a room down the hall with a large amount of standing water that had been there for who knows how long that smelled of mold. The only good part was the beach until we tried to use it. There were tiki huts but guests had to pay $20 to use them. You could get a chair if you wanted at no cost.But they charged you a $30 a nite resort fee. For what???Also, there is not much of anything to do within walking distance of this hotel. Stay elsewhere closer to South Beach even if it costs more you will regret it if you dont. This hotel is not worth $130.00 per nite and is no where near a three star."

"Review_13219","hotel_169","hotel_2139","Sep 28, 2008","Truly Fun Family Resort My husband and I stayed at Newport Beachside for 5 nights. We were greated by a friendly staff at the front desk and given a pool view room. We immediately noticed the air conditioner was not working properly and informed the front desk. They upgraded us to a beautiful oceanfront suite. The rooms have very large amount of closet space and hangers which I appreciate. The dishes, utensils, microwave and refrigerator came in handy for warming up restaurant leftovers and eating breakfast inside the hotel. There were 2 tvs which was great since my husband and I like different shows. The king bed was very comfortable. There was also a pull down bed which we used when one of us wanted to sleep later and not be disturbed since there was a sliding wall for privacy. Great idea! The jacuzzi tub and shower was the best I have experienced. We always had hot water no matter how long the shower was on. We have stayed at much more expensive resorts but none have compared to the happy and entertaining pool atmosphere. It was beautiful with all ages dancing and singing to the live music in and around the pool. The beach was kept clean daily but after the first swim my husband was stung by a jelly fish so we swam only in the pool after that. For transportation we used taxi service which I would recommend. We walked to several restaurants nearby. Emerald Coast had a terrific buffet for $20 which was great for a shrimp lover like me. The Safari bus and boat tour of Miami was worth the money. We left at 9am from Newport and they brought us back to the hotel at 4:45 pm; a great time. No need for a car at all. The Mexican restaurant across the street was expensive and lacked the red salsa and spices that I am accustomed to, The restaurant on the pier was fun but the fried fish and shrimp were overcooked and dry so we didn't go back there. Marshalls is across the street so I bought alot of nice things to take back to Michigan. Supercuts is across the street for a quick haircut. The hotel does have a beauty salon also. For the location, great pool atmosphere, friendly staff and a great price I hightly recommend the Newport over the other beachfront properties. We would go back in a heartbeat."

I, unlike some other reviews, thought the elevators moved quick. During the 3 night stay, we noticed the hallway floors beginning to collect papers and debris. In the lobby, someone was always vacuuming. We had an end room, so it was pretty quiet.The bed was comfortable. The TV is in the starngest place; when lying in bed, its in front of you, but off to the left and the remote was had to operate because I think the signal was being blocked from the cabinet. The couch was absouletly horrible, hard with no cushioning.The countertops were tropical tile.The countertop in the bathroom was wore, but you can only see it at an angle, very clean though.So, we had no complaints about the bathroom.The small pool had rust stains in it.Behind the live entertainment stage were puddles of water and pizza boxes floating in it. It was cleaned up after awhile.the girls at the outside bar were friendly. Unfortunately, one was really hard to understand. Then, all had to hide around the corned to check their cell phones while I waited for a beer..not professionally mangaed at all. For an outside bar, it was clean.Hurricane Ike just passed to the south so the surf was high and rough. There was seaweed all over the beach which should have been raked up so the next tide would'nt take it back out (and then back in). We went to Miami Beach instead and it was beautiful. The city raked the beach, no seaweed anywhere.At night while lounging on the beach, a homeless guy came by and made the mosr obnoxiuos sounds ever while he had a meat from each of the garbage cans that werent empty on the beach. We actually got up and had to leave.There was garbage and plastic water bottles all over the sand the one morning, thats what prompted us to go to Miami. Where is security?Behind the childrens play area was unkept. There is an old filthy jet ski thrown back there too.The pier was closed.Next time while in Miami, I'm going to look elsewhere for a hotel, however, if none is available, then I would book here again."

Although the winds from Hurricane Ike had us away from the ocean a couple of days the resort still had something for us all to enjoy. The complaints listed seem as if the vacationers booked from someone else and not directly with Newport Beachside itself. I know we all try to find the best deals possible. But complaining about the hotel when you didn't directly book with them I don't understand. Shouldn't you go back to the people who misled you? Anyways about my vacation you can't beat a suite for 5 days for $320. Free activities, movie nights, wine tasting, cooking class, live entertainment poolside. Not to mention the staff was great. One minor thing the hotel needs to do is update the rooms. The lobby is amazing but the rooms need some TLC."

"Review_13225","hotel_169","hotel_8384","Sep 7, 2008","Great location, Ok rooms - good for $70 a day Newport resort was way below my expectations. On arriving, I was greeted by a rude parking attendant who would not let me know how to self park. He insisted that I first checkin and decided to help himself to my car keys. The staff at reception was no better. They seemed bored, unfriendly and probably wanted to get out as soon as their shift was over. Checkin was smooth. I was informed of the $10 resort fee that will be charged in addition to what I had already agreed to for the room. Valet parking was a steep $15 and self park was $10. I strongly recommend that you opt for Valet parking as I did to avoid the hassle of self park across the road.My room had all the amenities one would expect such as a microwave, refrigerator and iron. While the room was not super clean, i would not call it dirty. What really disappointed me was the decor and the uncomfortable bed. The room did have a terrific view but the windows on the first day of our stay were not clean (they were cleaned up on the second day though). Carpets in the lobby appeared old and worn out.Newport does have a good pool and some ok restaurants. They also have a breakfast buffet every morning, in addition to activities planned throughout the day. There's a game room and laundry facilities on site. To summarize the best aspect of Newport is its location - close to the beach. If you get a place for $75 or less, i would think that would be a good deal. If you are too concerned about cleanliness and decor, you probably want to look elsewhere."

Although we did stay here previously I did read the reviews on Trip Advisor. I did notice that many of the complaints had to do with when people booked through an outside source instead of directly with the hotel. The entire staff was friendly and helpful, our room was cleaned everyday by 11:00am, we were checked-in within ten minutes and in our room by about 2:30 (we arrived at 1:00pm). In fact when we got to our room we called housekeeping and asked for two extra pillows. And within five minutes they brought them up. If you are looking for a place to unwind and relax, this is the place to go. They have a large pool and you are right on the beach. Are the drinks pricey at the pool bar, yes, but they are pricey anywhere you go. Can't wait to go back again.The Two Sisters"

Other hotels only had a pool. I felt the restaurants were a little pricey but there were many places to eat about 5 minutes in walking distance. The breakfast buffet for two averaged about $26 total. Also we bought two drinks at the poolside bar which cost $20, and they were not good. We checked in around 11p and the concerige was not very nice. We asked to speak to the manager, but he was even rude about that. Expect to pay an additional $10 a night for everything you would normally get for free at a hotel. We tried disputing it, but they wouldn't give in. The room was nice, but the door key was hit or miss if it opened. They blamed us that the card was not working, but I really think it was the door lock, because even the cleaning lady had trouble opening the door. Like I said the best part of the hotel was the beach."

I chose the hotel based on location, price and amenities, and indeed the price was so low that I was worried, until we got there. The hotel is gorgeous from the outside, and inside as well. We had reserved a one bedroom ocean front suite, and when they offered an upgrade to 2 bedrooms, but only ocean view, I was worried, since sometimes ocean view doesn't really allow a view. This was a wonderful view from the balcony, as well as from one of the bedrooms. The amenities inside the room were extravagant, the furnishings were new and up to date, and the location was great. We were right on the beach, with a huge pool and recreation area, and a great restaurant next door on the pier. The staff was helpful, really the entire experience exceeded our expectations. I was sorry we only got to stay one night."

However, cracks are beginning to show...literally. Rooms aren't as clean as they could be and many of the service staff seem indifferent to guests' needs. However, there is much to be commended: the beautiful beach (but avoid the rentals), front desk personnel who got us an early check-in, great games and activities for the kids (but a little wild by the poolside) and easy walking distance to shops, markets and restaurants. The valet service would have been worth it, as opposed to parking across the street for only a few dollars less, but one of the attendants dinged our rental car which we did not discover till after we left. This hotel is in danger of being swamped by the giants around it...a tighter control by management could easily return this place back to its glory days."

"Review_13239","hotel_169","hotel_1736","Jul 17, 2008","Looking for a relaxing oasis? This is not the place for you! My mother and I stayed at Newport Beachside Resort at the end of June. She had booked the hotel as a recommendation from my aunt. We had planned this trip as a beach getaway and that was what I was expecting. This place is ANYTHING BUT. When I arrived, I pulled back the covers on my bed and saw that there were long black hairs on the pillows. The housekeeping was lax, and did not come every day. I was having issues with my shower and it took forever for maintenance to arrive - which left me stuck in my room for ages (which is not something you want to be doing while on vacation). The lobby was a zoo, the pool was filled with screaming kids from end to end, so I was never able to use the pool. The pool area has a DJ blasting music all day as well. The beach is attractive but leaves a lot to be desired, as it's small, and when you try to distance yourself by moving your chair away from the crowd, the beach attendant comes by and tells you to move your chair back within the line marked by the cones. Nice - so now instead of being able to look at the beautiful ocean, I get a view of the back of someone's chair. Understandably, this is a lower cost hotel, so you get what you pay for: loud, obnoxious clientele and so-so staff and service. If you're an adult looking for a classy, elegant and tranquil beach resort or a couple looking for a romantic getaway, this is NOT the place for you! Unless you're into kids running around everywhere, DJs blasting club music 24/7 and lackadaisical service, then I would stay away. I know I will."

My family is very picky but we needed to stay somewhere affordable for the rest of our extended family to join us. This was an excellent choice for both of us. We paid $89/night and got a free upgrade to a suite (thru cheaptickets) on the 10th floor. We did take the first room available at check-in (simple room) but asked for the upgrade later in the day and it was worth moving for. Our room was fairly new and very clean. No complaints except we didnt have a great view of the ocean (very few do). But since we paid for a city view, we were happy. We are also the type to spend the nights out so we didnt need a balcony. The second room (extended family) was on the 7th floor and not as new but still clean. It is not as nice a resort as you would stay in Mexico, but still all the ammenities. Massage and bar service on the beach and the huts for rent ($10/day) were great! It was nicer than I thought. The pool and hot tub were OK, but since we spent most of our time on the beach, it didnt matter much. The palm trees on the beach gave it a great tropical feel. Three shops, a restaurant and bar were nice, but not much night life. South Beach is 15-20 minutes south by car - I'm glad we didnt stay there.

We arrived at 3pm and valet parked our car. We were the only ones at the check in counter when we were told our room was not ready but would be ready very soon. We waited an hour and a half before we were given the room key. The desk staff kept telling us it would only be 5-10 more minutes, we foolishly believed them. No apology for the wait.The room was what we expected for the price. Mouldy with old furniture. We booked for the view and it was perfect, right on the beach. The large window on the east wall was nice to watch the sunrises from bed. The Jacuzzi tub was manky and we didn鈥檛 use it. The mattress on the bed was a joke. Thinner than a fold out sofa mattress. We took the pillows from the Murphy bed to supplement the 2 flat hard pillows on the bed. The beach area was ok. Not very clean. We had a few other problems during our stay. Maintenance started painting the hallway the first morning of our stay and the fumes in our room were overwhelming. You can hear everything in the hallways, understandable for an old hotel but quite annoying at night when a majority of the hotel guest are there for the party scene. We also enquired about the shuttle to SOBE, which was advertised in a flyer in our room but the concierge simply told us 鈥渨e don鈥檛 do that anymore鈥? I wouldn鈥檛 recommend this hotel. I could see for the price and beachfront location it would be nice for a Miami party trip, but without the free shuttle it鈥檚 not worth being 40 mins up Miami beach from the night life.

Drinks and food can get pricey (10.00 cocktail) at the tiki bar. Just remember that 15% gratuity is already included on your order. There is also a restaurant on the pier (we did not try it though).The resort is located in Sunny Isles approximately 20 minutes north of South Beach. Believe me after spending all day at South Beach you will look forward to staying at the Newport. They also have a bar in house and live entertainment. You could easily spend a couple of days at the resort.The staff was very helpful and conveyed a cheerful environment. The concierge's are fantastic and take their time out to help you and you actually feel that they are there to help only you. The concierge also gave us passes to Prive' nightclub in South Beach. We went right in front of the line and they pulled the velvet rope up for us (keep in mind the passes are good only to 12:00am, after that 20.00 cover charge).The lobby is very nicely decorated with some unique ceiling fans spinning vertically oppposed to horizontally.The boutiques and shops are very affordable.The resort also has easy access to the beach area where there are jet ski's to rent for 70.00 a half hour.Amenity fees for staying one week are 140.00 ( this is charged to your account after your stay). This is charged for parking, activities and free wireless during your one week stay.All in all I would highly recommend this resort to my friends and family. The pictures on the internet site just don't do it justice.I am looking forward to my next stay at the Newport.Also just wanted to say that the valet staff is very professional and courteous.T.Lo"

The weather was cool all week which is unusual for mid April. The room was quite cold at night . There was no way to heat the room. It took several calls to get additional blankets. Our room was big enough and nicely furnished. Our room had a spa type bath tube . Unfortunately the drain was plugged up and we could not use it.Since we were on vacation we looked forward to sleeping in. Each day housekeeping staff would gather outside our door early in the am and talk quite loudly, some on walkie talkies.We did not find staff to be helpful or friendly. The rooms at this hotel are far from cheap. One of the selling points of the hotel is that it is on the beach.One would think that the beach area would be in better shape. The section of the beach allocated to Newport guests was filthy with trash and cigarette butts everywhere. We were approached by  Carlos while lounging on the beach who demanded to know if we were guests of the hotel. Staff seemed very concerned about who used their chairs but not how filthy the surroundings are. It was difficult to find a place to sun bathe without inhaling someone's cigarette smoke. A better hotel would find a solution to this.For the amount of money we expected a much better experience."

The balcony door was very difficult to open, and I had to actually lift up the door to stop it from scraping the balcony.I was awoken at 1 a.m. by a girl (drunk??) screaming out at the pool...it was taken care of quickly.A maintenance worker was drilling concrete nearby at 8:30 AM.The $10 resort fee did cover wi-fi. Beach lounge chairs were free, but if you wanted cushions there was a charge. The umbrellas, and tiki huts were extra.The staff was friendly. I did ask for coffee that was not replenished by housekeeping at the front desk. They didn't have any there but would send it to the room. Two hours later I had to ask again...it was immediately brought to the room. There was no refrigerator in the room, that I could find. There was hardly any space between the bed, and the wall, and window area. The bed was comfy with good pillows. Valet parking was $15 a day. Self parking across the 6 lane road was $10. Pretty expensive for the area, I think.The pier still isn't open. Although this sounds like a poor review, I did like the place."

How you can hire a waitress doesnt speak English in USA. At first it was ok with me but, then I went again in my weekend to the restaurant and I saw her as a cashier, so when I went to pay after I wait for more than 30 min to get my billl, I tried to talk with her and she only could say yes and try to smile, so I could not get the information that I need. I paid my bill and get the information at the concierge. I love the Hotel and always have a great time at the beach, but the service in the restaurants and the tikki bar is horrible. I wait too much for drinks, my waitress disapear and does not speak English, the rest of the waitress doesnt care. I think they need to improve the costumer service or hire people who have experience in restaurants and be bilingual.

When I have stayed at other 3 room suites it was 3 rooms but there were 3 t.vs but the two rooms were right beside each other so the two tv beside each other were kinda distracting. The third bedroom was divided by a wall so not really like three rooms. The efficency was a small fridge and a microwave so you could have breakfast in the room but that was it. The furnishings were very 1980's ok but not like a modern day hotel. Lots of mirrors to give the elusion of space. Two bathrooms and one jacuzzi tub in the room so would be awakward to use the jacuzzi with your kids as it was right in the room.Lobbby was very nice and the nicest feature of the hotel. as you go upstairs it does not look as nice as the lobby. Nice ocean side pool. Had some kids activities. second pool next door but not available to the hotel. Not in a bad neighbourhood but far to walk to anything else. Basically looks like they will tear this place down and build a better condo or nice hotel. I would stay here as it is ocean side and if you get a good rate but the rooms are circa 1980. could do better but for the price we payed and in high season it was ok. Just ok"

Even though there were 2 bedrooms we only had 2 towels. After asking for more, we got them 12 hours later. All of the vending machines and the snack bar were out of bottled water (we wanted to take some to the beach.) The bathroom had mold growing in the tile grout. The towel rack fell off the wall. The lock fell out of the door. No lamps in the living/sofa area. Breakfast cost $68 each morning. The pier was closed our entire visit - maybe permanently?"

The hotel has improved, it's now a non-smoking hotel.In the past, the Newport hotel has always been kid friendly  it's now even better. My eight year old won so many prizes, ice creams cones, sodas and breakfast.There are also events for adults as well.The food at the pool side hut is expensive but very good.We all loved our stay at the Newport this time even more than before.The only problem was quests with children from more expensive hotels with children came to use the Newport pool because of the activities."

"Review_13261","hotel_169","hotel_1881","Apr 18, 2008","absolutely horrible service Absolutely horrible service from management. I have never been treated so rudely from a hotel in my life. I really had a loss for words. They sold our room out when we got there after it was already paid for. So we got the executive suite which was more like the basement of a motel 6. On the last day of our stay, they said they mistakenly gave us the room and said we had to either leave the hotel or move rooms after we were already paid for. The rooms are decorated horrifically. It looks like all the decor was bought from big lots or a flea market. The rooms were dirty, the hotel was very dirty and smelled. They charge you around $20 extra dollars per day for no reason except for things that usually come free with most hotels. Charged us $250 for a comforter because of a small coffee stain, did not even notice until I got home and checked my card statement. Absolutely the worst hotel experience of my life. I really hope this place is up for demo. This place spent 10 times more money on thier curb appeal than the overall quality of the hotel and the rooms. SOMEONE FROM THE CLEANING STAFF STOLE MY DIGITAL CAMERA! They also tried to hide my brand new $250 sunglasses by stashing them behind the dresser! dont leave anything out!"
"Review_13262","hotel_169","hotel_5087","Apr 15, 2008","Great Resort! We had a great stay at the Newport Beach Resort, staying for 4 nights in a lovely ocean view suite. We contacted the hotel directly to ensure we reserved a room on an upper floor with a direct ocean view. If you book online, although cheaper, you cannot get this guarantee and perhaps that is why some people have had problems. We do not have kids and were a bit wary of the resort activities, but all of it was great. It is easy to participate if you want, but easy to avoid as well. The beach is beautiful, the suite was comfortable and large...yes, the decor in the rooms is a bit old-Miami but we like that. The view and balcony were spectacular-- just what we needed for a relaxing holiday.The surrounding area is quite nice as well-- great breakfast and coffee at El Tropico and we had 2 fantastic dinners at Fisher's Seafood. We had appetizers at Michael's in the hotel which was quite good, and an ala carte breakfast in the cafe which was average. The special drinks at the pool bar are good value although the food options are a bit lacking.If you are in the mood for fitness, there is a great gym across the street, I think it is called Miami Beach Fitness. John gave us a great deal for 2 x 3 day passes and we did everything from boot camp to Hatha yoga. It is really a fantastic gym!We will definitely be back to this resort-- only 30 minutes from the Miami airport and you are in another world!"

Amenities were as advertised, though the pier had suffered hurricane damage, and is closed. I'm told it will be replaced. Reasonable restaurants were nearby, as were drugstores and a supermarket. Food quality at the pool bar left something to be desired, but the same was true of some of those restaurants, as well. Bartenders did a great job.Rooms were decently-sized, well equipped, and kept tidy.It's really a place for families with kids, but it's possible to be a middle aged couple like us and still have a good time.Beach access and quality was excellent.I would definitely return."

The kids loved the activities, the bingo, metal detector on the beach for coins, hair braiding, crafts, etc. We stayed at the Lago Mar for a few days before this. This place is half the price of the Lago Mar - it is also not as nice. But when comparing the two I would pick the Newport over it because the value is so good. I understand that it is a time share hotel - but we booked directly on the web site and had no problems getting a great two bedroom suite that was available right when we checked in. I give the place two thumbs up."

They have a lot of activities for them.- Next to a nice beach.- Rooms were ok, but nothing special about them.- Free wireless internet- Several choices of restaurants within walking distance, but none of them really great of special.- Entertaining music next to the poolCONS:- Too many kids. The pool and hot tub were dominated by kids.- The staff was rude and cold most of the time. The staff at the Suntan Center were annoyed anytime you came and asked a question.- The huts and umbrellas on the beach are for rent only. - The bar next to the pool charged way too much for the drinks and they were not well made.- The Ocean Reef restaurant was convenient, but our waitress disappeared so I had to go look for her to get our bill. Gratuity is automatic 18%.- They allow smoking by the pool which stinks if you're a non-smoker."

We rented a two bedroom suite (6th floor/city side). Everyone enjoyed it. The location is good...right on the beach. The pool is fairly large and the area is well maintained. There were various activities organized for the kids. There are plenty of stores and restaurants in walking distance. Had a great cuban dinner at El Tropico just up the street. This stretch of Miami Beach is relatively quiet relative to SOBE. It is not nearly as chic (as our teenagers pointed out). Nevertheless, it is a good place to bring a family. Our only complaint is that the rroms are a little dated. They are not terrible, but it certainly is not the Four Seasons. Given the reasonable price and location on the beach, I felt it was a good value and would take the family there again. If I were a honeymooner, I would spring for the extra $$$ and stay in a posh hotel on SOBE."

When I arrived with my 3 children (a 6 yr. old and twin 4 yr. olds) I was exhausted and hoped to get into a room. I asked if I could give the front desk my cell number so they could call me as soon as a room was available but she said she could not do this small task. So I left the resort and came back at 3:30pm only to be directed to a room that had not been cleaned. So, with all 3 kids and luggage in tow preceded back to the front desk to be reassigned another room. Again it was a dirty room. I received no help with this matter and ended up just having to leave our luggage in the filthy room and coming back 2 hours later exhausted. My first day here was totally wasted. We had a 10 day trip planned and our last two days were booked for this same hotel and to our complete disappointment when we tried to check in at the appropriate time still there was not a room ready for us. I thought the grounds were nice for a family but it just seems the customer service has been lost here."

No. I would highly recommend this hotel and if you have children it would be a wonderful choice. There is a gentleman that has activities from 9 or 10 am until 5 for both children and adults. Guests also played sand volleyball, jet skied, frisbee throws, balloon toss and many more. Don't let other reviews scare you. Route A1A and route 1 will keep you on the true beauty of Miami.

"Review_13277","hotel_169","hotel_4407","Mar 16, 2008","The Worse Place I've Ever Stayed At! This resort typically goes for $899 a night to stay in the standard room which was extremely small compared to the deceiving picture on the website. We got a deal through Orbitz that included round trip airfare and a 4 days, 3 nights stay at the resort, but we still were expecting the same great service they boast about on the website. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable beds Ive ever slept on at a hotel. Ive slept on better ones at the comfort inn in Tulsa! The front desk service was rude, the woman checking us in wouldnt even look me in the eye, or say hello, or inform me why she needed my credit card when everything was already paid for in advance through Orbitz. She finally explained in a hateful tone they have to hold onto it until I check out. I was fine with this but it took her nearly 20 minutes to check us in which i felt was ridiculous since everything was already set up. Once we got over how awful our room was-nothing like what they show on the website-we tried to make the best of it and go to the beach. well thinking its a resort with a private beach we thought we could lay out wherever we wanted on the beach. nope. they set up big orange cones dividing a small square where we were allowed to stay and it was after spring break and super crowded. it was about a quarter mile stretch of sand we could all lay on. they did not raise the purple flag on the day when there was dangerous sea life out at sea so my boyfriend goes out swimming in the ocean and is swarmed with jellyfish. he comes back to shore and we walk back to the resort and there are literally dozens of jellyfish laying on the shore where we are walking! i dont understand why they have a flag for dangerous sea life when they dont use it! someone could have got seriously hurt. thinking its a resort we figured things would be more accommodating. room service was mainly what we did for food and had to order several times til they got the food to us. 2 pieces of cheesecake came to $26! and took 45 minutes to get to us when the MAX time they say is 20 minutes. this place is so OVERPRICED. one pina colada cost $8! there is no continental breakfast, just a restaurant that serves the exact same menu thats on the room service menu...kind of strange to me. the concierge man told me the front office opened at 7am and i had a flight at 8:15am the next morning to go home so i barely made my flight waiting til 7am to check out when all along the front desk is open 24hrs. so the concierge man lied to me. most importantly, the one thing that made this trip a total nightmare, was the fact that when i returned home i checked my transactions on my card that i had originally given the front desk lady to keep before i checked out. My transactions showed on two of the days while i was at the resort, Newport Beachside Resort tried to withdraw $100 on the first day, and $100 on the second day. Then on the 3rd day Newport Beachside Resort tried to withdraw $700 from my account. That's $900 an employee who had my card information from the resort tried to steal from me. Thank God I had taken out all the money from that account and just kept the cash. My report said all those attempted transactions were declined due to that of course, but still!!! I cannot believe an employee tried to use my card to steal from me. Overall the people there are very rude, shady characters and our stay was completely unpleasant."

We asked for an ocean view room (highly recommended). The room was supposed to be a suite however the hotel pictures we saw were somewhat deceptive - maybe they were taken with a wide angle lens!!?? The murphy bed in the 'sitting area' was perfect for our 2 year old, while the queen bed was fine for my husband and I, but this left no extra space for moving around.On a scale from 1-10, we gave the room a 5 for cleanliness. The room was tired, the decor was seriously outdated (hello 1980's and Miami Vice) and there wasn't much as far as amenities (we had to ask twice for face towels...)The hotel is right on the beach - for $10/day we rented a thatch-roof 'hut' that provided us with a break from the sun - it was much needed. I highly recommend securing one first thing in the morning (around 8:30am) so you've got it for the day. (There are only about 20 of them for the entire hotel.)If you're travelling with kids this place is ideal - lots of kids running around, there's a kids pool (and adult pool adjacent to the kids' one) and a play area with slides and stuff to climb right on the beach along with daily family and kid activities (bingo, treasure hunt, etc.).The location of the hotel isn't great. There's lots of construction nearby and not much to walk to. If you want a restaurant or place to shop you either have to drive or take a cab.We spent a cloudy afternoon at the nearby Aventura Mall - lots of terrific upscale stores for shopping.Many pictures show the famous pier at the south end of the hotel's property - don't count on walking along it any time soon...it's still closed. Apparently, has been for almost a year.Although it met our needs, we won't be returning any time soon."

We were just happy relaxing under the little huts (on the beach, that can be rented for $10 all day) staff was nice and helpfull, we rented also a car and used the valet parking for $15 extra a day, not so bad. hotel is very centrally located, near restaurants, shops, cvs pharmacy within walking distance.

I want everyone to be aware that the housekeeping staff enters your room at any time of the day. While I was in the bathroom one morning, I heard my door opening. I called out  asked who's there, they said housekeeping. I asked her to come back later. Again, less than 5 minutes later it happened. When I came out of the bathroom, I saw my wallet on the vanity. I did not put it back in the safe yet because I was still in my room. When I checked my wallet, my money was gone. To make a long story short, I spent a great deal of time of the rest of my vacation dealing with police reports and the incompetent housekeeping staff. The only person who sympathized with me was Armondo, one of the managers, who claimed that it was really out of his control. I had to beg to have my room cleaned (even though they entered and left my room many times without barely a knock on the door) and each time I needed towels they made me ask housekeeping to bring them to my room. At one point I was even able to prove to the housekeeping supervisor (via a machine that registers everytime a guest or staff member swipes the door with the key) that the maids had entered the room when she was told not to come at that time. I strongly recommend anyone thinking about this hotel to have second thoughts."

I was a travel agent for 8 years and I have never had such a bad experience. We booked and paid for our rooms online only to be told they didn't have any when we arrived.The manager lied to our faces and told us the hotel they were sending us to was as clean and nice as the Newport. I had checked online for days to find a non smoking hotel since many of us had allergies. The hotel they sent us to had no non smoking rooms and was full of mold. We had to sleep under an open window just to breathe, and ended up leaving the room at 5am because we became sick.This was the day before a cruise---what a great way to start a vacation.It never ceases to amaze me how unscrupulous and greedy some people are. They purposely overbook their hotel, then not caring at all about anyone else but themselves, send you off to what they know will be a bad experience. I cannot say enough bad about this hotel.

"Review_13288","hotel_169","hotel_3547","Feb 8, 2008","Basic but clean I stayed here for 5 nights at the beginning of January with my boyfriend. It was a last minute trip so we didn't do a lot of research. The hotel itself was very welcoming. We checked in and went to our room on the third floor. On entering the room the smell of stale cigarette smoke wasn't so welcoming and the noise from the air conditioning vent was loud. We went back to reception and advised the receptionist I was a light sleeper (slight non truth) and got moved to the 10th floor in a much newer/ cleaner looking room. In all the hotel is good if a little tired around the edges. There isn't much to do at the sunny Isles end of the beach apart from the beach itself. The staff were typical American 鈥榮mile have a nice day鈥?types and were very accommodating when I needed a plug adapter and when we asked for directions and things we should do information.The concierge was a bit abrupt but we did take one of their trips which was a sight seeing round Miami and boat trip ($50 each). Which was very good if you鈥檝e not been to Miami before we did it on the first day and it really helped us get our bearings and decide where we wanted to go back to.The public bus system is fantastic and took us everywhere we wanted to go for $1.50 each per trip. I would recommend, if your budget can stretch staying further down the beach towards Ocean drive where all the action is at night (and day) as a taxi costs $70 each way!Apart from that good hotel! It seemed to have lots going on for families, i.e. kids clubs and evening entertainment.We didn't eat in the hotel as it seemed over priced for what it was. There is a Denny's 1 mile down the road which we walked to for breakfast. As the buffet in the hotel was $15 each."

We stayed at the Newport for three nights for a friend's wedding in January (this is the hotel they recommended for guests to stay). Overall, it was a fine experience, but the hotel suffers from a major identity crisis. When you walk in, the lobby is very contemporary and nicely decorated with tropical decor that is subtle and classy...not tacky. The restuarant/bar off the lobby is very contemporary, as well, and has obviously been recently renovated. So, a very good first impression. However, once you get off the elevator to head to your room, it's as though you are in a totally different hotel...one that clearly has not be renovated in at least 20 years. The rooms, while clean, were so outdated it was laughable (my favorite were the bedside lamps that were shell-shaped glass bases filled with sea shells topped with teal pleated shades). On the plus side, we shared a two-bedroom, two-bath suite with another couple and it suited our needs both space and privacy-wise very well. One bedroom was larger than the other, but even the smaller one was fine, considering there was also a spacious shared living area (that included a murphy bed, great for kids or an extra adult). Incidentally, the bride stayed in one of the executive suites, which had been updated. It had a living area and kitchen in addition to a separate bath and bedroom. The decorating was tasteful, though nothing spectacular. There was a nice flat panel television. I was in the wedding, so I didn't have as much time to enjoy the hotel amenities as much as I would have liked, but they seemed nice. There is a nice pool, and of course, the hotel is right on the beach, which is a major plus.Overall, this is not a hotel I would have chosen, but it was a fine for our needs. Rooms were clean, the staff seemed nice, and the location is excellent right on the beach. Plus, it was nice to have the option of a two-bedroom suite...much cheaper than two separate standard rooms. Once this hotel updates its rooms, I think it would be a great place to stay. In the meantime, if you are looking for a good value and don't care so much about the decor, then this place would be a good option."

The pier is now closed except for the restaurant . Every part of the hotel and beach was spotless! There were daily activities for kids. I have never seen that at other hotels. Housekeeping and other staff were friendly and helpful.The Ocean Reef Cafe had a great buffet every morning. Their food was excellent. Michaels was pricey, food was good,(I've had better for the price) and probably wouldn't go there again. We ordered room service after 6pm and would sit on the balcony to eat. Another good restaurant is at the nearest mall, w/i walking distance. It's called San Telmo Parrilla, an Argintine steak house. I reccommend that place. I can't understand why anyone could possibly say this place was bad. If you do book here, get a room with a balcony. You won't regret being able to sit outdoors either overlooking the beach or the pool. Have a great vacation!!"

"Review_13292","hotel_169","hotel_4600","Jan 28, 2008","worst experience ever First my guaranteed reservation was GONE! I was sent to another hotel for one night.  My mistake was going back to the Newport. We were told they would have a room when we got there. NO! Then they said after lunch. Which turned into a SIX hour wait. By the time we got our luggage and room the sun was setting. And even then the room was not exactly clean. And people walked in the door and had their room ready before ours!!My advice would be to spend your money elsewhere. You will be happy you did."

We had no problem with the service IN GENERAL. We asked for an extra blanket twice and it finally came a few hours later. Other than that people were pleasant. The room was ok - we had a standard room, not much of a view. There was a park for the kids to play in which was great. The major problem was that there was a shadow over the pool which made it a little chilly. It was also cooler than usual that week. We ate at the pier a couple of times which was nice since it is outside. However, don't expect Ritz Carlton service there. We really couldn't figure out when the main dining room or lounge was open so we skipped it.We valet parked the car and never waited long. Overall it was a good experience and we got a fabulous rate on Priceline so it was well worth it.We would go again (in April)."
"Review_13294","hotel_169","hotel_3585","Jan 24, 2008","Hotel is ok I just got back from a 4 night stay at the Newport Beachside Hotel. We celebrated my grandmother's birthday with other family members who also stayed at the hotel. (I did not choose this hotel). I would say the Newport is a decent value oriented hotel. I am used to staying at 4-5 star hotels, which of course are much more expensive. So, as you can imagine, this hotel is in a completely different league from what we are used to. I will give positives and negatives of the hotel:Positives - Great location, friendly staff, heated pool, nice beach, nice lobby areaNegatives - Rooms, food, valet - sometimesI would say the biggest disappointment are the rooms. They appear extremely dated, and have a weird odor. There is noticeable rust in the bathroom as well. The windows were very drafty and loud, as it was very windy outside. We asked for extra blankets, which looked so old and dirty.If it wasn't for the rooms, I would rate the hotel 3 stars. The valet also took al long time sometimes, as the hotel seemed to be extremely busy with cars coming in and going out. To save $5, you can self park accross the street, but you can wait a long time for the traffic light to change to cross the busy street. Keep in mind, you are crossing over a very busy Collins Ave. All in all, a decent value oriented hotel."

I must admit on the drive in I was a little disappointed when we first pulled up as it looked run down in comparision to other hotels in the area. As soon as we walked into the lobby we felt relaxed, the music and summer feel was great. We didnt like the room we were booked into as we didnt want a carpark view when we had wait so long to be in miami! We payed extra and had a room overlooking the pool and beach- so worth it! hearing the music, watching all the activities was great. The kids loved it, swimming in the pool and the sea, and having a bar by the pool was good as we could sip on cocktails while the kids swam. We had grand plans of seeing miami and south beach there was so much we wanted to do, but after a 6 weeks tour of USA we were so happy to stay at the hotel the whole time. We did walk to the shops near the resort and bought up a storm prior to our cruise. The only downside to this stay was a grumpy old woman in the gift shop....we waited 10 mins while she was on a personal call- we gave up and went back later and as my son walked in she pushed him out and slammed down the door. He didnt end up getting the book he wanted to take on the cruise. Oh and the italian resturant was good too!"
"Review_13296","hotel_169","hotel_5970","Jan 15, 2008","Good, but not great... I went down to Miami Beach with my 18 year old daughter for a little bit of sun and relaxation since she is on break from college. We had a decent time, but this hotel left a lot to be desired. Firstly, there is no airport shuttle, and the cost of a taxi from Miami airport was a flat fee of $52.00, so be prepared for that... We only had a standard room, and it was definitely just that. My daughter was disappointed because the website said that there was a jacuzzi bathtub in every standard room, and... there wasn't...:( It did have a refrigerator and microwave, which was nice. I do not think the A/C was working at all. I had the temp. set on 40 degrees and the room always felt stuffy and warm. Didn't bother to complain cuz we don't like the room cold anyway... but still, would have been nice to have it a bit cooler in there... Also, the maids seem to have a problem replacing towels. You're supposed to have the OPTION of using your towel more than once... if you put them on the floor/in the tub, they're supposed to be replaced.... they never were. They would take the used towels and leave us with only one towel in the room! We had to call for towels one night, and the next time I made sure to leave a note asking for new towels. Jeeeez! There is no nightlife at this hotel, except for live music in the lobby. It would have been nice if there was a club with a DJ, so that adults could have some activities at nighttime. We were able to take the public bus right to South Beach for only $1.50 each, which was great. The buses run 24 hours, and it's easy to figure out which bus goes where. You can also catch the bus to the Aventura Mall, which isn't far away. All in all, we had great weather... we sat on the beach, shopped, got plenty of sun, and came back well rested, so we did enjoy our mini-vacation. I probably would not stay at this hotel again, but it did serve its purpose for us."
"Review_13297","hotel_169","hotel_10438","Jan 15, 2008","Great location, but a bit dated We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms (ground floor, parking lot view) and set our expectations accordingly. The room was large with dated decor and very loud air-con. There was also a lack of hot water for showering. We felt that the place had an air of faded glamour to it and hadn麓t quite kept up with the times.It麓s clear that the Newport is very family friendly and the location is excellent being right on the beach. It麓s also not far to the Aventura Mall, the largest mall in the area. Against this it麓s not close to the main action of miami beach (Lincoln Drive etc).The pool was a good size and there were always activities laid on for kids and adults alike. The lobby was nice and we found the staff to be helpful and efficient.Overall this place was fine, and no doubt you get what you pay for, but I didn麓t feel it lived up to a lot of the other reviews for this hotel."

After a hard days work all I wanted was a nice hot shower. The lobby was beautiful but when I got to my room it was not so nice. I must say it was very spacious but very Miami Vice and had a lingering stale smoke smell. That was the least of my problems though, once in the shower the water started to fill up fast and not drain. Ten minutes into my nice hot shower I was knee deep in water. Yuck, Yuck, Yuck. One of my biggest pet peeves in my own shower at home let alone a shower that millions of people have used. After reading the reviews I am surprised I had such a poor experience. Maybe for families it is different but if you are alone or on business I do not suggest staying at this hotel."

There were several activities for adults only including wine tasting and an auction. Michaels Restaurant wasn't open yet but all the other restaurants had excellent food and service. They are doing a very good job of upgrading the rooms and the only complaint I had was that our room could have used a new couch. I liked the fact that you were within walking distance of other good restaurants and shopping. You can catch a bus that stops in front of the hotel and takes you to South Beach or downtown. I would definitely stay there again and have recommended it to friends."

"Review_13318","hotel_170","hotel_10385","Dec 5, 2008","Good choice for pre cruise We stayed two nights pre cruise in November and found this hotel a solid choice for the money. The positives: Very large, nice but not great rooms. They include comfortable beds, large living room which has space for a table for 4, and three sinks total. Room was quiet except for some planes taking off (we faced the airport. The staff worked hard including fast check-in (still busy at 1 AM), and helpful in setting up port transportation for 23 at $10pp. The pool area was nice, although the pool was cold, and the workout room was first class. The grounds and lobby are in nice condition. The breakfast was good although large lines formed later in the morning. This is a large hotel which I suspect is very busy every weekend so expect large numbers at breakfast. The staff worked hard and seating was adequate. The negatives: The hotel is located in a no man鈥檚 land. The only possible place to walk to is a Bennigans, which I would not recommend going to after dark. We ate at the restaurant for lunch and the food and service was good, although we were the only customers. At dinner, the staff and cooks were terribly understaffed. It took forever to get our food and it came out randomly. This is with only half the tables filled, and people were waiting to get in. I would just order room service, which should take about 45 min to an hour. Towards the end of the free drink time, the line was huge with 25-30 people waiting. The two bar tenders were working hard but could not keep up with the demand.Overall a good hotel, just don鈥檛 get to dinner or the bar line late."

"Review_13320","hotel_170","hotel_9316","Sep 19, 2008","Good value for an airport hotel. This is a great place to stay if you are just passing through or have a car available, though parking is pricey for an airport location at ten bucks a day. What makes this property most enjoyable is the typical Embassy Suites very large room and the good breakfast. (There are free drinks at happy hour but we were always somewhere else at the time.) We had a very comfortable king bed. Easily the best value at MIA airport. You are NOT close to downtown, the grove or Miami Beach. The restaurant on premises is lackluster. During our stay the hot water completely failed, one elevator was out of service, our room keys were mis-keyed, the thermostat and tv remotes had dead batteries. It is rare for so many issues to occur at once but I will say that our complaints brought instant results. (Yes, we had warm miami showers that one morning but after we calmly expressed our disappointment we were given a generous discount for our troubles.) Positives: Eager to please attitude prevailed. Cheerful and efficient front staff. Large, comfortable rooms. Recently updated guest rooms. Very convenient to airport. Nice pool area. Convenient to EZ (on premises) and Enterprise car rental (walk across.) A very enjoyable full breakfast is included which is a good money saver. Negatives: Older property with some issues. No restaurants within walking distance. Pay for parking and internet. Poor sattelite TV reception. Van service spotty."

We used to stay at Embassy suites anytime we travel which would have been 5 different ones in 2 months, but this hotel changed our minds and our future reservations. Shuttle was great. We checked in and things were great, front desk staff recommended a few places to eat etc..... We decided to eat at the restaurant at the hotel (steak house)... big mistake. Food was great.... waiter was a total waste to include serving flat beer, having to ask for drinks to be refilled, asking for silverware, waiting forever for the food to clearly be able to tell it was cooked and ready and the waiter took too long to serve it. Waiter ruined dinner. We shook it off and went back to our room, watch a little TV, go to take a shower.....No HOT water and water was sitting in the tub? Can't be.... called front desk..Sending someone right up.....30 min later husband went down to front desk... moved rooms....still no hot water .....Now 10pm....changed rooms again.....no hot water, now 10:45pm. Was then told it was a boiler problem and should be fixed by morning, but we could talk to a manager... now what is he/she going to do about not having hot water boil me some and bring it to the room in sauce pans? We had to be at the airport by 5:30am could not wait until morning on a hot water and a prayer. Called guest services.... refused to give us the number to another hotel and did not have a phone book in room. I called the 800 number for embassy suites and they gave me the number to the Hilton. Then the Embassy charged us for each local call we made to try and find another room. Finally, husband was at his breaking point and calmly asked the front staff to get us a room at the Hilton and take us to that hotel. They agreed and had the shuttle take us to the other hotel. An unbelievable experience to say the least. The experience was so bad when we got home we cancelled our future stays at Embassy and booked with other hotels."

For 1 night on the 1st night then for the last 2 nights when TS Fay cut short our Key West stay.The one night stay was fine room fine, early to bed as usual when you arrive from the UK, big breakfast in the morning, no problems. Short taxi ride to Alamo to pick up the car then off to Orlando.Incidently if you choose Enterprise they are located directly across the street, and EZ cars have a office inside the hotel.The two night stay were were given an 8th floor room (we were on the 2nd floor for our 1 night stay) which smelt of damp. The second night we chose to eat at the restaurant. The food was good, expensive but this is a hotel.The restaurant staff were awful. Full of attitude. 3 side items were missing, but still appeared on the bill. When we queried this the girl took the bill and after a long talk with the manager came back to tell us the manager had agreed to removed them from the bill. 20% gratuity (we were a party of 8) some of the worst service we had in Florida. I think she was taken aback when we told her we had already the deducted the cost of the missing items and just walked away from the table leaving the money there.Back to the good. I wanted to send a parcel back to England, the security office couldn't be more helpful, the front desk were great, special mention to the girl who serves the cocktails. Perhaps she could train the restaurant in customer care.All in all I'd probably stay here again, but only for one night, its location for the airport and car hire are great and breakfast is great.Keep off the 8th floor and steer clear of the restaurant if you have a party (or split the party into 2 x 4 so at least they have to try for the tips)"

I could not get into its shuttle, so we found a wheelchair cab and the hotel paid for it as well as for the one gong back the next morning. We were very surprised!The accessible bedroom was on the 7th floor and we were pleased to see how much space there was. In the bedroom was a basin - set much lower than the one in the bathroom, but I could not go near either of them because they had doors set flush underneath! How stupid is that?Otherwise, the bathroom was most acceptable and the suite was very comfortable.Breakfast in the atrium was a bit too crowded for my liking and if you are catching a plane the cooked-to-order food will certainly delay you. We stayed with cereal etc."

We rented through EZ car rental which is located in the hotel lobby. Our room was clean and large but nothing special. The bed was firm but adequate.One elevator was not working and getting to our floor was a pain. It is under contruction so try to book a room on a lower floor that you can walk to.There is no free internet. You have to pay or use the business center which was full of kids instant messaging, doing myspace, etc. The management makes no effort to limit time on the computers - I guess they want you to get frustrated and pay for internet.Customer service is poor, the staff really didn't seem to care. But the price is ok, we paid $140 per night, and if you want to be close to the airport it is fine. You will need a car to get around. It is tricky getting into the hotel entrance by car, in fact driving around in that area is tricky. Our garmin was even confused. We were going on a cruise and the cost of the shuttle to the port is $10 per person. The free buffet breakfast was good, better than most hotels."
"Review_13328","hotel_170","hotel_1135","Aug 4, 2008","Stress, Stress and more Stress If you are thinking of booking a hotel near the airport pre or post flight with the least stress factor, then do not book here.We actually stayed five nights and prepaid.First, without doubt, it is the longest I have ever waited for a courtesy bus from the airport to the hotel.One solitary front desk clerk was trying to book in several guests, so another prolonged wait.Of the five elevators (there appeared to be no service elevators, so maids and porters had to use the only ones accessible to guests), four were working. So to get to the seventh floor (where our room was) it often took 10 to 15 minutes. Multiply this at least five times a day and you can sense the annoyance.This was further aggravated when issued key cards mysteriously and frequently did not work which required another extended wait to get them re-issued.The lure of a 'cooked to order breakfast' had its booking attraction, but the reality is quite different. Every day we had to line-up behind 20 to 30 people and then scrable to try and find a clean unoccupied table.It did not seem to make a difference whether it was 7am or 9am.The noise generated from literally scores of seemingly un-supervised children in the breakfast room and lobby drowned out any jumbo jet taking off over the hotel. On our first night we tried the solitary restaurant (The Barcelona).After first being told we would have to wait as they were busy. We were seated some minutes later, only to count 13 diners and at least 6 serving staff.We gave up on room service one night as we could not get an answer from either the front desk or room service numbers.Two other nights room service worked well but be prepared to pay $2.50 delivery charge plus 20% service and then a tip on top.On our last day we had arranged for a late check-out only to have the room maids bang on our door at least 10 times.And finanally, after settling our extras bill, at 1.50pm we waited for a 2pm airport courtesy bus. When it hadn't arrived by 2.10pm, I questioned reception as to when we could expect it and the concierge stated with had missed the 2pm, despite being there the entire time.In hindsight, we had a choice of two hotels, Embassy Suites or the Sofitel. Next time, I will waive the 'free cooked to order breakfast' and book somewhere I can hear myself think and access my room in a reasonable time."

We found the best rate by contacting the hotel directly. We chose this hotel because it offers hotel pickup and drop off 24 hours, going every 20 mins, and also offers a shuttle service the Dolphin Mall. Just outside the property and walking distance of about 5 mins is Bennigans, which we ate at, the food was great and service and price was good.It was good value for money and I would stay here again."

Despite the beautiful courtyard with palms, waterfalls and even some caged birds and the restaurant, which was not half bad, the rooms and other services in the area were lacking. Problems in room included a faulty toilet that sounded like the wall was going to come down each time you flushed; an airconditioner that leaked water (and it puddled) on the carpet in front of the fridge. When the AC was turned on it sounded like a V8 engine coming through the room. Also, had to call twice for toilet paper to be delivered to the room.The microwave did not work and of the two TVs in the room, one did not work (had a line running across the screen) and the other's remote was broken. Also, after sitting in the lounge area of the room for an hour, bug bites appeard on our legs - not sure what they were, but it was disgusting.As for services, do not use the gift shop or room service. Two diet cokes (10 oz bottels) cost us $9.00 - room service, while the gift shop was overpriced beyond belief.I always stay at an Embassy Suites, but will never stay at this one again. Two nights was bad enough."

I arrived at 2230 on a Thursday and Friday morning enjoyed the breakfast they offered, subsequently we left the hotel around 1430 on Friday and returned at 1600, on return luggage from our room had been stolen. My major concern was the way in which the hotel handled this, the first question they asked was should we call the police? I also noted that on return at least 3 room doors were opened by housekeeping and the rooms unprotected by employees, thus violating their own policy - to get into this hotel you have to go through a gate into a secured compound. My warning is this: the hotel accomodations are nice and pleasant, be very careful about your possessions and use the safe!"

"Review_13340","hotel_170","hotel_6789","Apr 14, 2008","I wouldn't stay here again...not bad, but... I stayed at this Embassy Suites last week for 2 nights on business. It was an average Embassy Suites... not great, not bad, but I'd stay elsewhere if I was staying near the airport in Miami. I've stayed at the Hilton, Marriott, and Homewood Suites and I prefer all 3 to this hotel. The good: Its an Embassy Suites... larger rooms, complimentary breakfast.The not so good: LOCATION. This isn't the first time I've stayed at an Embassy Suites that was inconvenient to other hotels and restaurants in the airport area. This one is close to a Red Roof Inn a gentlemen's bar and a bunch of rental car lots. It isn't close to every other hotel near the airport and it was a $15 cab ride for me to get anywhere around the airport.Cleanliness - It wasn't necessarily dirty, but I moved the couch away from the wall to plug in my computer and it appears that I was the first person to do this in a while. Clock radio was not working.At 11 PM, I had to call 3 times in order to get a wake-up call. You're a business.....answer the phone."
"Review_13341","hotel_170","hotel_10449","Apr 14, 2008","Not alot for the money!!! The hotel was neat and clean. We were able to check in 3 hours early which was great, because we had an engagement to be at during check in.The staff was extremely friendly and nice. The Manager's cocktail hour was great, and the breakfast was fantastic. The restaurant, while I didn not eat there, advertised Omaha Steak products of which I am not a fan of. The hotel is a little hard to maneuver into the first time, but you can get the hang of it after a few in and out trips, and it was nice to know my car was parked in a secured lot with 24/7 security.Overall it was great, it is just so expensive to stay there, I paid $160 and didn't feel like it was a great deal. But if you compare with other hotels in the area, it is the most affordable hotel without complaints of mouse droppings, so we were willing to pay the price. Wish I could have gotten more bang for my buck, Miami is just an expensive place to stay!!!"
"Review_13342","hotel_170","hotel_4927","Apr 6, 2008","Great stay I recently stayed here to attend a conference at the University of Miami. Having flown into the Fort Lauderdale airport, the hotel is hard to find if you are not familiar with driving in Miami. Be prepared to make a few laps around the airport before you find the entrance to the Embassy Suites. If you fly into MIA it would be very convenient, as it is right next to the airport. Look for the big pink hotel... it is hard to miss!We had a king room with a sofa bed in separete living room area, typical Embassy Suites room. The entrance to the bathroom was in the bedroom, which I didn't like, though.There was an opening sliding glass door off the bedroom that had a tiny balcony. Enough room to stand, not to sit. Although it was right next to the airport, the glass is pretty soundproofed. The balcony looked over into the pool area and the airport.The pool and hottub area was nice and made to look tropical. Although they should do a better job of keeping towels stocked.There was a long line for breakfast, which can be frustrating. The Happy Hour evening drinks was a nice feature that we enjoyed, though.The internet service in the room worked fine, although I will be glad when Embassy Suites stops charging for this service.Room service is also available.It was a short (but harrowing) drive to many spots in Miami, including South Beach, University of Miami, Little Havana, and Biscayne Beach to name a few.Overall, I would stay here again if in the Miami area. It is a good central location and much cheaper than the hotels on the beach."

Like most Embassy Suites built from the ground up, this one had ten stories of rooms, all opening out into an Atrium with trees, fountains tables and wireless access. Rooms are more than comfortable and they had the best flat panel TVs I've seen in a hotel yet. One in the master bedroom and one in the living room. They also have the best free breakfast of any hotel with an omelette station, tons of fruit and breads, pretty much the works. The onsite restaurant, Barcelona, has great steaks, reasonably priced. The desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly and even offered to pick me up at my car rental facility, so I could drop my car off and not have to deal with it before my early morning flight. Even though we had a panoramic view of Miami International Airport, we didn't hear a sound in the room. Embassy Suites aren't cheap, but they are worth it."

This is the worse one I've stayed in. Pros: Rooms recently renovated.Cons: 1) Line for hot food at breakfast exceeded 20 minutes on weekdays at peak hours, even if you just want bacon you have to stand in the same line. Very annoying for business travelers. Only on weekends did they bring out buffet hot food. 2) Waitstaff at breakfast were overworked or disorganized with items not refilled. 3) Hotel is right next to the airport, so unless you like hearing airplanes, it's not a great location -- nothing else around it, and South Beach is a $30 cab ride away. 4) Staff were largely indifferent to even basic questions5) I asked for a 5:30 am wakeup call and didn't get it. 6) Price not that cheap. 7) Co-worker found cockroaches in his room on the sixth floor. I hope I never stay at an Embassy Suites again based on this stay."

When i arrived the front desk was very friendly and completly explained the workings of the hotel, When I got to my room it was very clean, but I did smell a strange odor, I think someone smoked in he room though it was non smoking. I opened the balcony door and the room aired out nicely so no complaints. I decided totry the Manager Reception, they offered great free drinks and chips and salsa. I was pleased with the quality of the drinks, mosy hotels water down even when you pay for them, but they did not. The next morning I went to breakfast. It was an awesome spread to be complimentary.

Mainly because we were tired, but also because the airport courtesy phone (only to this hotel) was out of order, we took a ten minute $14 taxi ride. The hotel, despite being in an office block commercial area is quite impressive with a nice lobby and the general areas, particularly the bar, where we had a decent snack and the restaurant where we breakfasted were very nice. Pool area was also well kept with an unusual waterfall feature.All of the staff we met were pleasant and very helpful, the concierge arranged a cruiseport shuttle bus for us at $10 per head, but be aware a cab should only be $24 anyway.The corridors and rooms were disappointing. Everywhere was very clean but with obvious signs of wear and tear. Airport noise was just loud enough to be annoying even although our room was on the opposite side. View of the lagoon was nice but a new building was going up next door. There is nowhere else within walking distance to eat, but there is a small shopping centre about four blocks away. I would'nt discourage anyone to stay here but I expect there is better to be found."

The rooms are spacious and well appointed, everything is clean and the maid service really pays attention to details (such as replenishing toilettries and decorating the tissue box). The swimming pool area is well-kept and the waterfall is a definite plus. The bar has great cocktails, always served with a smile and a variety of snacks, which is a nice touch. But the highlight of my stay was the bed, probably the most comfortable I have ever seen. The combination of down comforter, pillows and featherbed was just heavenly. I highly recommend the hotel for anyone who needs to stay near the airport. It is not convenient for the beach area though. Other minuses were the fact that you can hear the airplanes land and take off (yes, the windows will vibrate), and the lack of free wireless internet although they have computers next to the bar that you can use at no charge. They also charge for parking but if you don't have a car they offer a free shuttle to/from the airport."

From the website and reviews we thought it was going to be a nice trendy/new hotel, but it was far from it. You can tell it is an older hotel with a bad flip/lipstick remodel. Although they upgraded us to a suite complimentary, we didn't see it as an upgrade. Not only did it have a bad odor from the extremely old rug, it also wasn't completely furnished.Also, we wanted to order room service since we didn't arrive until late and had to catch the first flight out. They not only charge an automatic 19% gratuity to any order you make, but they also charge a $2 delivery charge. I can understand papa johns charging a delivery charge to cover the gas increase, but when it is room service, I think that is just ridiculous.Paying $120/night, this hotel was extremely overpriced for the quality."

"Review_13363","hotel_171","hotel_5991","Jul 18, 2008","Not all that I know this review is a bit late, but thought I'd give my two cents anyways. My sister booked 3 rooms at the Sofitel via Priceline. Reading the reviews/pictures, the hotel looked nice. We got the price of $120/night for each room. We were on a family cruise and the Sofitel was our post cruise hotel. It was a convenient location, free shuttle to the airport. the next morning for our flight back home. We got off the cruise ship and headed to the hotel in our rental car. The first thing we noticed was that you had to pay for parking! I did not think that was necessary in a hotel where there wasn't much around anyways, mostly office buildings and parking did not look like it was at a premium. We were early checking in and wanted to drop our bags off first because we were planning on spending our day at Sawgrass Outlet Mall (which is amazing!). It was around 12 and no rooms were available so we put all of our luggage/bags on one cart and asked the bellhop to store our stuff and when our room was ready, just to put all of the luggage/bags into one room and we would deal with it when we got back. We did tip him and he did put all of our stuff in one room which was great. We shopped all day and by the time we got back at the hotel after dinner, it was late. We decided to return the rental car instead and that way we did not have to pay for the parking. We were all so tired by the end of this and we still had to pack/re-arrange our luggage to make room for our purchases from Sawgrass. When I walked into the room, what a surprise. The room looked very old/worn, nothing like the pictures! The red door to our room looked like it was from the beginning of time! The carpet looked gross and dirty, the walls needed a paint job, the washroom did not even look that clean! There was actually a used q-tip on the floor under the sink! My brother took a shower and he said there was no water pressure and it was not draining properly, he was in 3inches of water while showering! I did not bother to even shower. We had 2 queen beds that looked very nice, presentation wise. I was looking so forward to just getting some sleep but it was the worst bed I have ever slept in! It must have been 20 years old! I was afraid to pull the beds sheets off the bed just to look at the mattress. It was so soft/un-supporting that I just sunk in. I woke-up with a sore back of course. I would not recommend this hotel, I think you would be better off at the Hampton Inn where you even get breakfast included with your stay. I was on the 9th floor, first room on the right - so if you get that room, try and switch!"

Each and every one was more than friendly and helpful. And the food, for fussy world travelers, was really delicious and beautifully presented.

We were greeted warmly, even though we booked through a discount travel agency. Our room is large, king size bed and non smoking. The hotel has all the amenities we could want. (does not have a fridge, but we didn't need one, nor want one). I suppose a person could find minor flaws in the rooms, but really, they are minor!! Our room is immaculately clean. The bed is comfortable and cozy. The onsite restaurant is expensive and there isn't much within walking distance (so far I haven't found anything, but I'm still looking). We'll probably have dinner here. There is a lovely lagoon behind the hotel which can be seen from some of the rooms, I'm sure, but we have a front of the hotel view.The pool is really pretty and convenient. Exercise room is around the corner from the pool. Starbucks (mini) on site. They don't have the skinny latte's, which I generally get, but you can still order non fat latte's. (same thing without the SF syrups)We are staying one night at the end of a cruise with NCL. and paid $12 each for a shuttle from the port to the hotel door.

The first room we stayed in was leaking water in the ceiling. It was raining in Miami. The toilet in that room was also not clean. The good thing is, before we could call the front desk to complain, the bellman had already told the front desk what happened and they called me and offered us an upgrade. That was good. In the new room, one of the beds had crumbs in it. When I called housekeeping to ask them to change the bed, they never showed up. We were late for dinner, so we left and came back later that night. When we got back, I called housekeeping again and the night shift was great! They came right away and changed the bed and even redid the bathroom and touched up the entire room. They were also very nice about it. I'm a travel agent and I got a good deal on the room at $199 a night.

There were hairs on the bathroom floors, beat up tiles, chipping counter tops, dirty carpets, etc. Yet it was $250 a night! What a rip-off. I would have left if we hadn't checked in so late.

"Review_13372","hotel_171","hotel_7937","Feb 25, 2008","Nice stay at the Sofitel We found this hotel through Trip Advisor and booked it through Travelocity. It is very difficult to get a hotel in the Miami area at this time of year for just one night. We were leaving on a cruise on the next day. A hotel shuttle circles through the Miami airport every half hour. you just go out and wave it down. There is no charge for this service. While you are close to the airport, the rooms are very quiet. We got in early enough to use the pool area (where you sometimes did hear jets). Check in was quite easy, however I had to tell the receptionist that I was a Sofitel preferred guest. She did not see this on the reservation, even though I had specifically called the hotel with my guest number. She asked me for my number, which I happened to have on me. While I was getting it out, she found it on the original reservation. This entitled us to a free drink at the bar (quite delicious in a very nice setting). She also gave us a cork to use for a free glass of wine with a food order. We did have lunch in the restaurant. It was rather pricey, but it was convenient and quite good.The room was nice, much like the pictures on the website. The bed was quite comfortable. However, in a few areas, the wallpaper was beginning to peel away from the wall. The bathroom was very clean. Toiletries were from France. We took a cab from the hotel into South Beach. It was rather expensive. I think it was about $40 or $50, one way. The concierge told us that a shuttle to the port was available on the hour in the morning. he put our name of the list. Cost was $10 per person. It was there promptly at 12:00 p.m.Check out was easy and the bill was accurate."

The room was very comfortable, probably the best sleep ever. None of us wanted to get out of bed. The bar / common lounge allowed the entire family to sit and enjoy a drink and some appies prior to the excellent dinner we enjoyed. It would be nice if the pool was heated, but this wasn't a big deal.You won't be disappointed."
"Review_13374","hotel_171","hotel_1809","Feb 10, 2008","Excellent and good value We stayed one night as it's very close to the airport and we had an early departure. It's only a 5 min drive from the airport but you don't hear much plane noise.All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.The room was a good size although the bathroom was slightly smaller than expected. The main point is that everything is spotlessly clean and very comfortable.A couple of things were missing though - no safe and minibar which I expect as standard in this class of hotel.We arrived quite late and didn't wander around the area but there is a tiny shop in the lobby for small items such as bottled water and crisps/chips.No complaints about the food as both room service and breakfast was good and reasonable value too.Strongly recommended"
"Review_13375","hotel_171","hotel_6303","Feb 8, 2008","Slightly Below Sofitel Standards, but Still Good The Sofitel Miami is located just 5 minutes by car from the Miami Airport. Half the rooms offer a nice view of the lagoon.The rooms are very spacious and feature the usual Sofitel bed (my favorite). The bathrrom were OK, but felt more like those you'd expect from a Hilton or a Marriott.Those driving will find the parking lot in front of the hotel very convenient. You do howeever need to pay before exiting (like in any parking lot). The room service food I had was excellent and prepared on time. I enjoyed the outdoor pool as the gym is also convenient.The shortcomings of the hotel were the lack of minibars in the room, the Marriott/Hilton style bathrroms and the fact that ice cream (in room-service) was only available in pints (Ben  Jerry's). Also, I wanted a pair of slippers (not already in the room) to go to the swimming pool but getting the message across to the spanish-speaking maids proved VERY difficult.The staff was very friendly and helpful during my stay."
"Review_13376","hotel_171","hotel_6368","Feb 8, 2008","Decent, but not special Stayed at the Sofitel Miami pre-cruise for one night. Received a discount through a professional org.; wasn't dirt cheap but was much better than the advertised rate. Hotel shuttle from airport was speedy and we didn't wait long at the curb. Bed, as others have mentioned, was very nice. Firm, but not like a slab of rock. Our room was adequate, but kind of run down overall. Bathroom grout was stained and the bathroom sink cabinet was shabby and marked up. The TV speaker in the bathroom was a nice surprise. Kind of freaky at first, but then I realized how much I enjoyed being able to listen to the news while I was primping. Our room was really nothing special - didn't feel like a fancy hotel. Airport noise was not a bother. Service was prompt, efficient, and mostly friendly. Breakfast buffet was average - had some French touches (crepes, jams, fancy eggs). Coffee was served from a French press and was delicious. We noticed little bugs crawling up the wall by our table (we ate inside). None on the table, but that still gave me the willies. The shuttle to the Port of Miami was very affordable. I suppose I was hoping for something a little more special and distinctive when I booked the Sofitel Miami - we were celebrating our anniversary (hence the cruise getaway) and I wanted our whole vacation to be awesome. I didn't feel like the Sofitel met my expectations in this regard. It wasn't as lush as I had hoped and was led to believe."

Arrived at miami airport with no hotel booked and rang the sofitel from an ad at airport .The hotel told us to get on the sofitel bus which leave regulary from airport which turned up virtually straight away. The lobby and bar areas look fantastic with a stunning swimming pool directly outside. The beds were extremely comfortable and rooms a nice size with a great lake view. This is a 4 star hotel and a good one at that. Probably not a holiday hotel as it is not to close to beaches but very good value for what we paid i would definately stay here again in simular circumstances."

"Review_13380","hotel_171","hotel_6429","Jan 7, 2008","OK if you get it at a discount I had signed up for the Sofitel Priviledge program hoping that it would be the start of a beautiful relationship, but such was not the case. Arrived at 1:30 in the morning, which meant that I had missed the last airport shuttle and had to pay $15 for a cab. My request for reimbursement was met with a Gallic shrug. There was no indication that my room had been upgraded and no so-called welcoming gift. The sour faced bartender tried to cheat me by charging half price for the guaranteed free glass of wine. There were a few things that I liked: the free internet in the lobby, the quietness considering its proximity to the airport, the comfortable bed, the $10 per person shuttle to the Port of Miami and the relatively easy walk to nearby shopping, pharmacy, restaurants and manicure/pedicure. All in all, it was not too bad an experience and I would probably stay at this hotel again, but only if I got a steeply discounted rate through Hotwire."
"Review_13381","hotel_171","hotel_9494","Jan 7, 2008","A Fairfield Inn Masquerading as a Sofitel Prior to this stay, I had thought luxury when Sofitel came up. No more. While there were some nice aspects to our stay, we would not return and not recommend others go. Trip Adviser has stellar reviews of other hotels within walking distance. Our seminal experience was at Le Bar. Surly Sam, the bartender, basically told us what we could do with the TV remote. (Should he have taken the day off?) He had gone missing when a group of young men were seeking drinks. He showed after an 'underling' had appeared to take care of the men, and Sam treated his 'underling' as well as he treated us. I must admit he was upstaged by the cost of 2 drinks here. We were in South Beach one night and got twice the number of drinks plus some delicious bruschetta for the same price of two drinks here. Note that was in South Beach. However, if getting insulted and soaked is your objective, go to Le Bar!On a positive note, the lobby leads to a stunning seating area overlooking the lagoon. The concierge and bell staff is first-rate. Check-in and out was efficient and friendly. Going upstairs we found the hallways unexceptional to dull. The drab wallpaper was rippled or torn or scuffed. The room was OK. As a previous reviewer said, there is no sheet between you and the comforter, leading us to wonder if a clean comforter is placed on the bed after every guest? No mini-bar. The room was spacious with a nifty little alcove with chaise for reading or watching TV. The bed was comfortable. Nice closet with iron and ironing board. Room service for our morning coffee was always friendly and timely.So what else is not to like: the noise in the hallways. This is the first place I have ever encountered a dog barking in the hallway about midnight. Lots of talking and yelling back and forth several times. No fan in the bathroom, so you have to open the door to clear the condensation. The towels are thin and few. (We stayed at a Hyatt a couple months ago and had a towel rack full of towels in our bath. How can you wash your hair and get it dry with the same towel you have to dry yourself with?) As a final note of disbelief, our maid left us no wash cloths on our final night there. Why on earth do they have you come and go with an activated parking card when you can enter after a certain time without using it? When the woman at the gate tried to explain, we couldn't understand her, and she couldn't understand us. Yes, I know they want to extract their daily $8 but this system isn't reliable. We had the same lack of understanding with messages left for us. I love other languages, but the whole reason for speaking is to be understood. I've gone on more than enough. We wished we had stayed elsewhere. I later learned for the amount we paid (sorry it wasn't Priceline but through a travel agent), we could have had oceanfront at the Marriott!"

"Review_13383","hotel_171","hotel_8772","Jan 3, 2008","Can recommend the Sofitel Airport Miami Excellent hotel from speedy check-in onwards. Only 5-10 minutes walk to local shops including Publix (open Sunday), restaurants and RC church. Rooms were clean ,comfortable and quiet, breakfast buffet good, staff helpful, pool area clean and uncrowded with lovely view of the lagoon. We didn't find the 24 hour hotel cafe until the following morning - not realising you have to walk through the restaurant to get there. Maybe it should be signposted? My only other adverse comment would be that the airport shuttle bus filled very quickly on Sat evening - we were lucky, but others at the second terminal were left behind. Still, at the price we paid on Hotwire I'd be more than happy to take a cab. I'd stay here again and recommend it to others"

"Review_13394","hotel_172","hotel_2029","Dec 17, 2008","Greatest Location on the Island!!! I was born on Oahu and know the Islands quite well. When a great deal came available, which included this hotel, we jumped on it! Positive things first: the hotel is in absolutely the best location in Waikiki. It is right on Kalakaua Avenue and looks directly onto the beach and the ocean, with no obstructions. We walked everywhere ... so easy to get anywhere, from the Moana Hotel (just a block or so away), to the local McDonald's on the corner. The staff is quite hospitable and goes out of their way to accommodate requests. We were especially pleased with Argie and Greg. The negative is that the hotel is really 'tired' ... the furniture in the rooms is old and scratched and dented, even though you can see, that at some point, they were lovely black veneer Chinese. The carpets are stained. The elevator is an E ride in Disneyland! We were originally assigned an oceanview room on the third floor, but after one night (and a request from us) we were moved to the sixth floor. You can tell that this hotel was originally a lovely boutique hotel, but needs some TLC (new carpets, furniture, paint) to get it back to where it might have once been. The rooms are small, but that was to be expected, considering the boutique atmosphere.If you are going to Hawaii and expect a 4* atmosphere, this hotel is not for you. If you have a good sense of humor about things and realize that you got a heck of a deal for a grand location and if you are out of the room most of the day and into the night, then go for it.There was nothing like waking up in the morning to the sounds of the birds in the Banyan tree directly across the street waking up, too. And at night, listening to the business of the street below ... and the feeling of the warm Hawaiian breeze ... well, we liked it ... and would do it again."
"Review_13395","hotel_172","hotel_1962","Dec 8, 2008","Best hotel in Waikiki for the Value! This was my second stay here. I had originally read a review about the staff being friendly and decided to stay here. Its the best hotel for your dollar. Its cheap, conveniently located close to everything. Its got the best price for being right across from the beach. The staff were amazing as always. I would stay here based just on that fact alone. The room attendants are very friendly and courteous. Trust worthy! The front desk staff are over the top. They will do anything for you. Greg helped us out both times that I stayed there and he was amazing. I cant wait to go back and visit. I would highly reccomend this hotel to everyone I meet and would definately go back. If you go ask for greg, he will help you out with anything you need."
"Review_13396","hotel_172","hotel_3753","Dec 5, 2008","nice but... Nice hotel for the price, great location but buyer beware on the cheaper rooms. Standard Interior Room means no windows! These rooms do have frosted jalousie windows in the door which opens to the hallway (which is tiny and open to the outside so there is a chance of fresh air while sacrificing security and privacy). Moderate Hotel Room comes with a lanai (balcony). Cool! Except the view is a blank concrete wall of the parking garage behind the hotel. Sound echoes off this wall into your room making it quite noisy with the door open until later at night when traffic dies down and the ac units are shut down next door. This is the room we had for three days. 'Partial Ocean View means no lanai/balcony and room on the side of the hotel near the back. Probably the best of the cheap rooms but it sure is nice to have a lanai in Hawaii. The best rooms are on the front of the hotel and have full ocean views and lanais. If you plan to stay more than a few days pop for one of these rooms and enjoy the sunset with a nice drink. I suggest a can of Pass-o-guava with vodka poured in... shake and drink... better than the candy sweet tropical drinks at any of the big hotel bars. Ingredients readily available at ABC stores which are about every 10 feet in this neighborhood."

"Review_13398","hotel_172","hotel_4801","Nov 7, 2008","It's what we expected...and more. Jeff G. Silver Spring, MD.What can I say? It was what we expected and more. The staff was amazing - from tips on food and hiking spots that only locals know, to being very friendly anytime day or night. Trevor at the front desk was the best and helped us beyond what he should have. If you are looking for a 5-star and book this one - you'll be dissapointed. If you don't mind a few cracks on the floor or a stained carpet (since you don't eat off it) this is your place. Central Waikiki, beachside and lots to do in the area. If you like a friendly place to stay and want to save a few bucks - you're at home. We stayed for 6 nights, had not 1 problem the whole time. Breakfast was continental - pastry, fruit, juice and coffee - enough to satisfy your hunger and get out into the fresh air. For our 1 year anniversary - I have to say thanks to the hotel and staff for allowing us to stay and spend our money on the rest of our trip and not the hotel. Sure, the room was small, but we didn't visit Hawaii to stay in the room. The shower was fun and we could see the beach and our TV from the bed. IF you let the little things in life get to you - don't stay here and take away a good thing with your bad review. If you like to take it easy and don't mind a non-perfect hotel - book it and have a great time where you want to. Just want to say thanks again and we'll book there next time we go back."
"Review_13399","hotel_172","hotel_2134","Nov 6, 2008","Great Hotel/amazing staff This is my second stay at this hotel in the last year, and I would stay here again no questions asked and would definately recomment it to family and friends. The staff at this hotel are amazing, I have never met a group of people that are friendlier then them. The room attendants always say hello when they see you in the elevators and the hallways and try to make a point of remember which room you stay in. The staff always greet you in a friendly manner when you walk past and always have a smile on their face. Although the rooms arent that big, when you are on vacation how much time are you really spending in your hotel room anyway. This hotel has the best rates that we could find especially since it is right across the street from the beach. Greg is one of the front desk staff and he has been there both times I have stayed there and he is always willing to drop everything to help you with whatever you need. Honestly if you are not looking for a room that is huge in size or a top of the line 5 star hotel I could not recommend a better hotel. I can't wait to come back to Waikiki and stay at this hotel again!"

"Review_13401","hotel_172","hotel_1093","Sep 9, 2008","Location, Location, Location! I stayed at the Aqua Waikiki Beachside from August 27th - September 1st. I do alot of research on hotels before booking online, and using Tripadvisor, I found the reviews for this particular hotel to be 50/50. Because of the great price I got through Expedia.ca, I decided to take my chances on the Aqua Waikiki Beachside and was not disappointed. First off, you have to keep in mind how many stars a hotel is rated, and what you are paying per night, and that way, your expectations will be realistic. I am a germophobe, so that is my main concern whenever I book a hotel. The Aqua is an older hotel as many in Waikiki are, however, I found it to be relatively clean, and the cleaning staff were very friendly and were helpful in retrieving items I requested such as sewing kits or extra toilet paper. Yes, the decor is outdated and the pink carpets dirty-looking, however, many people in Waikiki walk around barefoot, so I am assuming, after all these years, the hotel carpets must have absorbed dirt and debris from any feet that may have stepped on those carpets, along with normal wear and tear. I bring my own slippers when I travel, so I was not phased by the discolouration. Even if a carpet looks clean, I would never go barefeet on it because looks can be deceiving.When you book a room, be mindful of what type of room you are booking. I booked a 'moderate hotel room' which gave me a partial view of the beach across the street, but for more money, you could get a room with an oceanview, or for less money, an interior room with no windows. That might be a tad claustrophobic for some, so do take note of what you are booking and don't assume anything. If you are clear on the details, you will know what to expect.The room I got was not huge by any means, but was liveable for 2 people, and we did get a queen bed. I read some reviews where people ended up with 2 twin beds instead of a queen or king, but remember, your requests are not guaranteed especially if you have late check-in because like all hotels, rooms are based on availability. The type of room you book, such as an oceanview or partial view, will be guaranteed, since the prices are higher for those, but bed type might not be. Do always call or email the hotel to check or confirm if you have any concerns. Hotel staff are there to help. An added bonus is the small fridge where you can store leftovers or drinks. The hotel is not 5-star by any means, so you have to expect that you will not get 5-star service or amenities like you would at the Hyatt. The free continental breakfast is nothing special but is great if you want a quick bite in the morning and save some money on breakfast. It's free, so people should really stop complaining that it doesn't offer variety. You have about 4-5 kinds of pastries/muffins, 2 types of juice, bananas, oranges, and coffee and tea. i think that's pretty good for free. If you don't like it, then go buy a real breakfast. You always have a choice. The entrance is a little hard to find if it is dark or if you do not know where you are going, so make sure you check for the address and directions before you leave the airport. It's very close to the Hyatt, so if you see that, then you know you are there. The location is super because you are literally across the street from Waikiki Beach and the Police Station. You will be close to many shops, restaurants, International Marketplace, Royal Hawaiian Centre, etc. Kalakaua Avenue, where the hotel is located, is a major tourist hub, so walking along the street at night, you will see buskers/artists do their thing, and it is very safe. Downtown Honolulu and Chinatown are a little sketchy at night, and I would not venture out there in the evening, so if want to explore those places, do so in the morning. There is a free hula show at Waikiki Beach at 6:30PM every night (weather-dependent), and it is right across the street from the hotel. You can also catch the sunset around that time, as it tends to get dark fairly early there (around 7-7:30PM).If you are planning to do a tour of the island, North Shore, Pearl Harbour, etc., I would not buy tickets online beforehand, since when you get to Waikiki, you will notice tons of people on street corners handing out pamphlets for cheap tours. Do your homework and research though, or else you can get ripped off or take a tour that is not to your liking. Make sure you use a tour company that is legit and don't get sucked into those timeshare companies. Know what you want and ask the right questions. If you are to book online beforehand, I would use Discover Hawaii Tours site since I booked a tour with them through Expedia. Going directly to the source itself will save you some money, I realized later. If you go to International Marketplace or Duke's Lane for souvenirs, know that you can barter, and if you start walking away after they give you a price, it always goes lower. In fact, it can go down several times since every cart sells the same stuff, and you can always go to another vendor.If you are taking kids with you, the Honolulu Zoo, along Kalakaua Avenue, is one of the best zoos I've been to! It is not too big but has all of the cool animals that kids like to see (i.e., tigers, chimps, elephants, etc.). Plus, it's only $8 for adults, and $1 for kids under 13 or 14!! Can't get any better than that.Sea Life Park is overpriced for what you see, so I would not go out of my way to visit. The luau there has a fabulous menu though, but all luaus are cheesy and not worth the money. You have to go to one though when in Hawaii, so that one's not bad. Buying tickets through a tour company was $10 cheaper than what is advertised through the Park itself, so look around. Good thing about the Sea Life Park luau was that you get free admission to the park for use within 30 days after. That's how I found out the park really sucked, but at least I didn't pay for it.Anyways, hope all of this is helpful! Have fun in Hawaii!!"

We had asked for early book in but was told that that was impossible unless we upgrade. After discussing the price and rejecting the idea we were then told $50 cash would see us into a room. I know that this went into the guys pocket, but was desperate to get into the room after travelling from Australia. The upgraded room was smelly, very damp and had single beds, shower full of mould and strings of silicone where leaks had been resealed time after time....Back to the desk new guy on reception wh gave us another room marginally better....The included breakfast was limited and we never did see the promised picnic packs for the breakfast on the beach......I am sure that this hotel was top class in the 1960's but for 2008 it was old, depressing, dirty and the staff were just lining their pockets...wouldnt even class it good enough for back packers......we were supposed to be staying there on the way back to Australia but thank god for my travel agent who changed our hotel booking to a fabulous hotel for the same cost......The minute we stepped into the reception area and saw the dust, and dirty ornate mirror we knew we had made a mistake.

I just have to start by saying that the staff at the Aqua beachside are amazing!!! The front desk guys are all so friendly and helpful, anything we needed they did for us and any where we wanted to go, they helped us get there. At first glance the Aqua beachside is definitly tacky.... the pink carpet, walls and even pink fabricated head boards are a little out of date but they are working on doing renos. We later realized that even though it did seem tacky at first... its actually a really cute and has a ton of character. IT may not be the newest or the nicest place Ive ever stayed but it was super cute. Besides the staff the next best thing about this hotel is definitly the location... literally across the street from the beach! You couldnt ask for a better spot. Our first day we walked out the front door a watched a surf competion right on Waikiki beach. So if your looking for a place tto stay that is friendly, cute, cheap, clean and a great location then this is your place. If your looking for somewhere high end, classy, and romantic.... try the Hilton. I have nothing but good things to say about the Aqua beachside and its staff......Hi Trev and Greg!!"
"Review_13405","hotel_172","hotel_6057","Jul 9, 2008","Looks like it was a nice hotel...once upon a time I knew a bit about the hotel before heading in, so I wasn't overly disappointed. However, there are some things that the hotel could be doing to make a more pleasant stay for their guests, that they're not doing at the moment. I and two others stayed in two separate rooms for 4 days this July.The desk manager was very polite and helpful...and a looked a little overwhelmed at times. I knew the rooms were on the small side before booking, so that wasn't a surprise. However, I was somewhat surpirsed to see the run down condition of the place. The shower lining was old and leaked, cabinets were chipped, wall paper peeling, etc. Still, for the location and a decent price I can get over that. Other than a filthy looking carpet, the rooms were clean. The decor throughout the entire hotel looked like it was probably FANTASTIC once upon a time, but has since really deteriorated.Housekeeping was hit or miss. Sometimes they'd clean in the bathroom, sometimes not. Sometimes you'd get a replacement washrag and hand towel, sometimes not. When we called the front desk asking, eventually they said they were out. Yet we discovered later....by being nosy and looking in cabinets on our floor...that they did indeed have washrags... ;(I think what bothered me the most was the used mattresses piled in the 2nd floor hallway and also in the outdoor eating area. Not only was this really tacky looking, it could be a potential heath hazard as the rain creates mold, etc in/on the ones outside. It's probably expensive to dispose/move them out, but shouldn't that be a high priority for the owners if they're refurbing? Most people eat the continental breakfast out there on 3 tables that aren't buried by mattresses.One HUGE positive to this hotel is location. It's literally across the street from Waikiki beach. If the current owners stick with it and put the funds into the hotel necessary to bring it back up to the level it once seems like it was, WOW. Right now, if you don't mind clutter, marginal housekeeping, I'd say it's ok for you. Otherwise, pay a little bit more for the other hotels on the same street."

The bones of the place are pretty gross and I can only imagine we selected that hotel based on the wrong review or something. Fortunately they were kind enough to allow us to transfer over to Beachside. For $20 more we went from a bad motel to the cutest little hotel right there on the beach. The room was slightly aged but had a charming historic asian design to it. We were staying only one night before our cruise started but we were so thankful to have stayed there.

However if you are looking for a clean room, KILLER views (floors 6 and up are best) and within walking distance to all waikiki activities.....this is your place. We knew starting off that we would not be spending much time in our room, so we went budget and we are sure glad that we did! The staff was awsome, front desk was sooo helpful (call hotel directly for room upgrades. They will beat any advertised price and check for daily parking rates, we paid at check in and saved 60 dollars!) The continental breakfast was basic, but did the trick. I would definatley suggest this property to friends and family. Keep in mind, the rooms are small, too smal for kids! But perfect for 2 people trying to get away for a relaxing vacation who are also on a budget..."

Understand hotel has recently been bought by Aqua chain and looks as if it will be undergoing renovation in the near future - scaffolding all around hotel during my stay with workmen there friom 9 - 5. Interior does need updating and is rather worn and dated - however, location compensates for this.Breakfast is a bit of a joke though and unless you are there when it goes out forget it, my 1st morning there I arrived at about 8.15am to be told there was nothing left! Even when there there is food left it's poor quality muffins only."

It is an older hotel that has been remodeled and updated. If you look close, you can tell it's been around awhile, but everything is clean, fresh and updated. The room is amazing. It comes with three queen beds! The bathroom was adequate, but the shampoo and conditioner was out of this world, made with local ingredients. The room was extremely large and very clean, with a small refrigerator and microwave for our use. We were lucky enough to have a corner room so because of that, we had two balconies, one overlooking the busy street (great for people watching) and one that you could get a glimpse of the ocean from. The hotel is a few blocks from the ocean, but well worth the walk. Close to restaurants, shopping and just about anything that you could ask for. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I would definately stay here again."

The room was tiny and the quirky oriental furniture very worn. But nothing could out do the horrible dirty worn carpet. It was supposed to be pink but it was grey in path areas. The bathroom had been redone and was great. Other than the worn icky conditions, the linens, etc were clean. The hotel is being refirbished, which was not a problem....but they really should not rent out those rooms until they take up that carpet. We were too embarrased to have our other family members up to our room. Now the view was spectacular. Full front on view of wakiki beach....amazing. And the location is fabulous. I wouldn't stay at this hotel until ALL the work has been done....especially the carpet. The rooms don't look anything like the online pictures. The staff was nice. I really felt sorry for those people who had booked a room with a view of the wall."

The room was shabby  dimly lit which helped to hide the poor condition of the furnishings. The bed although comfortable had a large piece of hardboard under the matress to support the springing  the carpet was old  deteriorated. The bathroom was of a better standard with an excellent shower!!On the upside..the staff were very friendly  helpful with advice on things to see  do.The only other moan is that upon check-out we were charged $18 per night for car parking  not the advertised price of $10.. I think that the new owners would be be wise to close the hotel down until refurbishment is completed rather than try to mix guests with building work  so risk a bad reputation for the future!!"

I drink lots of tea and it was never a problem when I fronted up at reception with my mug and tea bag for the staff to get me some boiling water.We had been given a top floor sea view room but a lower floor room was requested and it did not matter that it was a garden view. In fact it was nice to be able to sit out of the direct sun on our balcony.This is a basic hotel so please do your homework before booking.I have traveled all over the world and it is unusual these days to get a double bed but it is easy to check this before you leave home.

The day we arrived the hotel was in in their first day of new ownership by the Aqua group. When we were checking in I had requested a room with a view, although the reception person didn't answer me, it appearred that he heard me. He advised us of all the extra charges at that time. Using the safe $100, local phone calls $1 each...This hotel is quite old but clean  neat. The room that was assigned to us had a beautiful bathroom, glass shower... 2 single beds  the view was a cement wall, but we did have a patio. When I called the desk to let them know there were single beds  my reservation said double bed. I was informed that you cannot request what size of bed you get. I asked the attendant if it seem right that a married couple should have single beds, anyway, I asked to be moved to a room with double bed  view as my reservation stated but he said there were no rooms. I attempted to use the phone after speaking to the desk but now the phone wouldn't work. We decided to try to make the best of it  go for a walk on the beach. The beach was right a cross the street from the hotel, beautiful sand, easy to get in the water there. Local renting surf boards, burger shack, lots of people. When we returned from our walk I asked if the phone had been fixed yet but no one seemed to care. I had had enough so I asked to be moved to another hotel. They moved us to the Aqua Palms  Spa. This hotel was exactly what I had requested, view , king bed, staff were absolutely wonderful. We stayed there for three nights. I would definately recommend this hotel."

"Review_13418","hotel_173","hotel_5602","Oct 4, 2008","Loved the Ilima! I stayed at the Ilima for 8 nights in a studio superior room with my husband because of all of the positive reviews we read. We stayed in room 901, which had a beautiful view of the mountains, the Ala Wai Canal and the Ala Wai golf course. This hotel is a great value for $115/night with the 5th night free! I'd highly recommend this room because of the view. Plus, it was very quiet- street noise was not a problem with the balcony door closed. The room was impeccably clean. Make sure you request a mountain view when making your reservation because some rooms only have views of the street and other buildings. Noise might be a problem on lower floors, but it wasn't an issue on the 9th floor. I was extremely surprised to read some other reviewers complain about rude staff because every staff member I encountered during my stay was very friendly and helpful! One staff member offered to lend me a beach umbrella for the week when I inquired about where to buy one. Another staff member suggested a great alternative to the nearby expensive supermarket and gave us detailed directions. The location (10-minute walk to Waikiki beach) was fantastic. The pool was very warm, but refreshing in the evenings when it was a bit cooler outside. The lobby is very pleasant and attractive. I highly recommend this hotel for budget conscious travelers who do not require room service, concierge services, etc. Save your money and stay at the Ilima! This is a hidden jewel!"

"Review_13420","hotel_173","hotel_1401","Sep 29, 2008","Great for families I picked this hotel from reviews I read here, and they are spot on. The location is great, with a small grocery 3 blocks away so one can take advantage of the kitchen facilities. The room is spacious (much bigger than our company-paid room for the other half of our trip at twice the price). The firm beds took a little getting used to, but were fine. The extras like the chocolate-covered macadamia nuts for check-in and the shell leis at check-out were nice. When we arrived Friday morning during the sing-along, we were still able to check in, and although our room wasn't ready yet, we were still able to get towels from the desk and go to the beach. The free parking in the small garage was never a problem, although we did make it a point to be there by late afternoon and do our evenings on foot. The safe was big enough for the laptop. The only minor disappointment was that the pool was closed for repairs when we were there, but these things happen. I would go back again, and heartily recommend it to anyone with kids. If you want valet parking, spas, onsite gourmet meals, etc. go elsewhere. Check the hotel's website (and keep checking back) for great deals."

We've been to Waikiki several times and stayed in a few different hotels, but this is one hotel that we would love to go back to.The hotel is located about two blocks from Waikiki beach, off of Kuhio Avenue, where there are tons of restaurants! Upon checking in, they gave us Hawaiian cookies. That was nice. Our studio room was nice, clean, and very spacious, especially for our family of 4, which included 2 young kids. We liked the free parking, and if you come back early enough, there wasn't a problem getting a spot. My husband had difficulty one night finding a spot and he simply parked on the street. The bathrooms were modern, the beds were comfy. They had coin operated washers and dryers, and sold detergent for a nominal fee. The rooms had kitchens with a full size fridge which was convenient. With all the restaurants surrounding us, we never cooked. The hotel offered beach towels and beach mats, which is a nice touch. They also gave us newspapers every day. Upon check out, we each received a shell lei.We got a great rate off of the website. I thought it was great value, a nice place, and an extremely convenient location."

With a fridge, microwave, stove, pots, pans, coffee maker and coffee the only thing you need is your own food. There's a coin operated laundry room on the property. The hotel staff seems to work hard to keep things in good order. There was a problem with an appliance in my room and it was fixed immediately. There is a small pool and dry sauna.

Nice small pool and they will provide matts and towels for the walk through the International market on Dukes Lane to the beach..We did not rent a car but parking was free and the BUS was down @ the corner. We felt safe walking @ night. The only problems we had were calling Waikiki Shuttle (also knows as Kahula five star). We took a bus to the Capitol and the bus drivers were rude and did not help us with where to get off and we got lost and spent a lot of time..We thought the 1 1/2 hour Bus ride to the Arizona would take too long but this shuttle drove around Waikiki hotels for 45 minutes and then took people to the airport (the ad only mentioned the arizona and the Swap meet)...The driver was very rude.. ..We were forced to pay round trip and though they advertise a shuttle every 30 minutes, we waited 1 hr and 10 minutes..I called twice and was screamed @ and hung up on...($24 for 3 people)..Several Buses left and we made a mistake with this as it took 2 hours to get there and 2 hours to get back...Also, we wanted to surprise My Granddaughter with a limosine back to the airport and Honolulu Cab  limosines was a no show and we were forced to grab a cab for $40 at the last minute..We called several times and got voice mail. Beware of transportation problems, especially when you have kids. The zoo was not worth the price but the beaches and free hula show was great.. We had been to Germaines Luau 20 years ago and it was wonderful but this time the food was so bad, the 3 of us could not find anything we could eat and we did not like the atmosphere but I have never been to any of the other Luau's to compare it to..We had a wonderful time otherwise due to this hotel."

"Review_13427","hotel_173","hotel_2398","Jun 2, 2008","wonderful We stayed here for 5 days at the beginning of our honeymoon, May 19-24. I have to say the entire experience was wonderful, from booking to check out. We booked the room on their website while they were running a special, $125/night for the Deluxe room. The room was huge, with a King sized bed AND an additional double bed, along with the kitchen, desk, and plenty of closet space.We requested a corner room on the 12th floor on the advice of another reviewer, and I received an email from the girl that does reservations asking me what kind of view I wanted (street view or canal view). I told her I wasn't sure, since I've never been there, but mentioned it was for our honeymoon. She was extremely friendly with her advice, and ended up giving us an amazing corner room with a mountain view. When we walked into our room after an excrutiating 10 hour flight, all I can say is it instantly erased our jet lag. The view was absolutely breathtaking. One whole side of the room was floor to ceiling glass. You can see the canal, the mountains, and at night, the beautiful twinkling lights of the city. Besides the great view and rock bottom prices, the hotel offers several amenities that ended up costing us dearly at the other 2 hotels we stayed at during our trip: free parking and free internet access. Not only that, but we didn't realize how handy it was to have a full kitchen. We were able to keep a full case of bottled water and some milk and cereal on hand for early mornings. It's just little ways to save money that really add up in the end. The on-site laundry facilities were very helpful as well. The location is extremely convenient, within walking distance of practically everything.As honeymooners, we picked 3 different locations for the duration of our trip: the Ilima to start, followed by a mid-range resort on the Big Island, then a high-end resort for our last 2 days in Oahu. We actually enjoyed the Ilima the best out of all of them. It's very private and quiet, which was great for us. We always had the pool to ourselves, which was nice because we really enjoyed taking dips at night after spending the day site seeing. We had a lot more opportunity for private, romantic moments at the Ilima than we did at the other resorts that were always brimming with families and other couples."

Even though check-in time was 3pm the friendly staff at the desk made a room available and checked us in straight away. This was really appreciated after the flight from Sydney. The rooms are definitely above average in size with a small kitchen and a full size fridge. The room and bathroom were very clean and everything worked. We stayed in two different rooms, firstly on level 11 and then on level 5, both rooms were quiet. Another nice touch is that the reception area has some nice paintings.I'd recommend the Ilima to anyone who wants a hotel in a good location at a reasonable price especially if you plan to do some cooking whilst on holidays."

He or she also knew how to avoid the chipping paint, the squashed bugs on the walls, the mildew on the shower curtains, the dead light bulbs, and the small size of the rooms. The parking is free, but there's very little of it, and you have to walk all the way around the building back to the front again after parking in the back. The brochures show glowing pictures of full breakfasts, complete with ham, but it is a regular contintental breakfast. The person I made the reservation with, though not onsite, saw the pictures and told me what a great breakfast they had, and it was all an outright lie, because the pictures lie. The rooms are neither spacious nor well-lighted. Everyone here speaks Spanish, but that might be what's expected in Miami. If you don't have to visit Miami, don't. If you do, find a better hotel. This one is also 8 miles from Miami Beach. On the online map I looked at, the star to denote their hotel was right on Miami Beach. It's not there, it's in Doral, 8 miles west."

There is plenty of free parking. You can park your car for 14 days (free) and they provide a shuttle to the port @ $9/per person but not back to the hotel. We didn鈥檛 use this feature, but it may be economical for some. There is a fountain out front and the lobby is very nice. The gym and dining area had a new feeling about them. The carpeting looked new on our hallway and in the room. There was a slight smell in the room, may have been the new carpet. The bedding was comfortable and fresh. The bathroom was clean and it seemed as if there were some new renovations including the vanity area. The gardens around the pool are very nice and we had the pool to ourselves. The breakfast is a nice plus with sausage, potatoes, and eggs, which were new to me. It was like a flat poached egg. I had never seen this before, but most people seemed to like them. There were various breads, pastries and fruits to choose from and the beverage choices, juices, teas, milk and coffee seemed vast. The coffee machine produced some wonderful and varied brews, highly recommended. One of the reasons for choosing this hotel were the decent reviews for a 2-star hotel especially for cleanliness, which is a must for me, and a refrigerator in the room. One of us requires refrigerated medicine. When I asked the front desk to put the very small portable fabric cooler in the kitchen freezer so that the ice packs would be ready in the morning, they accommodated us with a smile and I had no problem retrieving it the next day.

We called from the third room and the desk clerk came up with new room keys and escorted us to the new rooms with our luggage. One room was upgraded to a suite. The other problem was with the transfers to the port. Our travel agent had prepaid these transfers for us on her credit card. The hotel however had no record of this information. They did try to contact the travel agent on Sunday morning, however with a 3 hour time difference were unable to do so before we needed to leave for the ship.

Our room (which they said was the only one available when we arrived) was on the first floor right near the breakfast so it was a bit loud in the hallways. We found the room's layout awkward. The only sink was directly in the path of the door. If you were washing up and some one opened the door, you got smacked with the door. This also made washing up a bit less of a private experience. We were traveling with quite a bit of luggage and room could barely hold us and the luggage. The pool was nice and it was heated. They have a nice selection of sodas and small snacks that you can buy at the front desk. The breakfast was ok but very crowded and we could barely find a place to sit. Our second morning at this hotel we went out to eat instead of fighting the crowd at the breakfast. All in all, the hotel was ok.

"Review_13446","hotel_175","hotel_5904","Oct 6, 2008","Overrated!!! Spent 2 nights at this overated hotel. Great location for a stay in the French Quarter. We had 10 couples staying for a wedding and each couple had a completely different size room for the same price??? One room was extremely tiny, others were huge - all for the same price. Front desk personnel were horrible!!! Arrived to find no phone in our room. Requested 3 times to have one placed in the room to no avail. Left the hotel without a phone and no service recovery from anyone. The front desk could have cared less. There is a club attached to the premises and the music reverberates throught the entire first floor. DO NOT STAY ON THE FIRST FLOOR. Also, the outside rooms are extremely noisy due to the location at the corner of Bourbon  Orleans, so be wary if you want to go to bed early. You can request an inside room which does help, but stay off of the first floor due to the club noise. Decent restaurant although a bit pricy. Can do better in the Quarter. The only reason I would stay again would be their location but it may just be worth it to find another locale and find transporation into the Quarter."

I received an internet rate of $64 a night, but the bill indicated $127 and we were charged for a valet service that we did not have for one room. Check your billing statement.Also, the rooms were very small and our view was the room of the building next store, but for $64 I can't complain.On the other hand, great location and the staff are very nice."

We got checked in okay, if a little slow. The lobby is very nice, and the room seemed very nice as well when we got into it. One lamp didn't work; there was a stain on the carpet; the shower knobs were broken. This is all stuff I can deal with and be happy with in a hotel where the location is so great (and it really is great). But the bed was horribly uncomfortable - just hard matresses. And then there is the noise. I am not talking about street noise either. Our room was facing St. Ann (back of the hotel). Yes, we could hear a din of noise from Bourbon Street partiers until late hours... but this wasn't really loud of intrusive. It was more of a dull background sound that I had no problem sleeping through. The noise from INSIDE the hotel was so much worse. The maids start banging on doors between 7:30 and 8:00 - looking for people who are checking out - and until 9:00, they are constantly slamming doors up and down the hallway. I have never heard anything like it!"
"Review_13449","hotel_175","hotel_1644","Sep 27, 2008","Great hotel in superb location This is a really nice hotel in the most central location you will find in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The hotel is situated on the corner of Bourbon and Orleans Street. We stayed in one of the Courtyard facing rooms and there was complete peace and quite. You would never know that Bourbon St was right outside the building. The building itself is really beautiful and in good condition. The rooms are a very decent size and the bathroom is great. The decor in the rooms is slightly dated though, but other than that, the rooms are great. The staff were nice and friendly. The pool area is very nice, though the pool itself is one of those that goes from being 5ft deep to being 8ft deep in the space of about 6 inches so watch out for that! Also, for central New Orleans, the rate was fantastic and the staff were very helpful at getting us the cheapest rate.The only reason to fault this hotel is that they charged us $30 a night for valet parking, but our car was actually just parked on the street outside the hotel the entire time! Seemed like quite a rip off really!Generally though, this hotel is highly recommended."

"Review_13451","hotel_175","hotel_6402","Aug 2, 2008","Nice hotel, nice staff, clean rooms and ghostly good! We've stayed at the Bourbon Orleans several times over the years and always enjoyed our stay; particularly for the location. Yes, the outside rooms can be a little noisy but lots of hotels in/near Bourbon street can be that way. Request an inside room (courtyard view) instead. We've never had a real problem regarding noise. Staff are always nice and hotel is clean with normal signs of wear and tear.Our rooms have always been above average in size (larger usually) and we always leave the hotel feeling we got a value for the location and amenities. This hotel is supposed to be one of the more 'haunted' places in the area/New Orleans. We've never really paid attention to that; however, on our last visit we left less skeptical!Our room was an outside room and we regularly heard what sounded like a door slam coming from the air conditioning system and it always happened when we tried to take a nap or go to bed at night. It was random but occurred all through the night. I got up and checked to be sure the air conditioning wasn't the problem, and could see no reason for the slamming. There were no guests adjacent to us and nothing was going on outside (particularly in the wee hours of the morning). It was the same door slam sound throughout the night.This happened for the two nights we stayed. I jokingly complained to the hotel staff during checkout that we either had a ghost slamming a door or they needed to look behind the wall where the air conditioning was. They didn't laugh like it was a joke and, interesting enough, other staff were interested in hearing more about it.Did we experience a haunting? Don't know but coming from someone who usually takes the 'logical' side of a problem to explain something, I'm a bit less skeptical now.Regardless, I'd stay at this hotel again with no reservation!"

In fact, I have posted several good reviews of this hotel.Since it is no longer a Wyndham, it has taken a turn for the worse. While booking through Wyndham, I always got a great room, free internet and other amenities. Since they are no longer with Wyndham, I received probably the smallest room that I've ever stayed in (complete with a scenic view of a nasty service alley between buildings), they've removed the in-room safes, and now charge for the internet. In addition, the front desk staff are not too polite or helpful. There are two things the Bourbon Orleans have going for it now: a wonderful concierge and the location."

You could also hear anyone that passed by your room, and the housekeepers talking.The front desk was not overly friendly, (not rude).

"Review_13457","hotel_175","hotel_3529","May 12, 2008","Just okay My husband and I go to New Orleans every year to attend JazzFest. Last year we stayed at the Bourbon Orleans, which at the time was a Wyndham Hotel. We enjoyed it so much last year that we decided to stay there again this year. However, it should be noted that this hotel is no longer part of the Wyndham group, and has gone downhill since last year.The hotel nearly triples its rates for JazzFest, as do all of the other hotels, airlines, etc... because they can. So what would ordinarily be a $99 a night room was now a $249 a night room (using the JazzFest discount!). Our room was very small, with a queen bed, desk and office chair. No other chair, and really nowhere to sit anyway. I walked by the bed and whacked my ankle on something. When we looked, it appeared that the box spring had not been placed on the frame correctly, causing the metal frame to be exposed. Since it was under the bedskirt, I did not see it. I had an enormous bruise that still hurts more than 2 weeks later. The phone did not work. There was no safe in the room. They used to have safes in the rooms, as do all hotels where I've stayed in New Orleans. But the safes have now been removed, and valuables can be stored in a safe behind the front desk. Very inconvenient. So those are the reasons the hotel was not as nice this year as last.There are two great points about this hotel. One is that it is in a wonderful location. It's within easy walking distance of the heart of the French Quarter, Jackson Square, anywhere we wanted to be. And a major asset at the Bourbon Orleans Hotel is their concierge, Ron LaGaie. He knew everything about the city, made dining recommendations, gave us discount coupons for tours we wanted to take... He appears to love his job, and when I asked how long he'd been there, he told us this is his 19th year as concierge at this hotel. He makes up for some of what is lacking in the hotel.All in all, we would stay there again because of the location, but losing the Wyndham name has caused some noticeable changes in the Bourbon Orleans Hotel."

I was in a group of 4 and they gave us a single bed, knowing we had a reservation for 4 people. They said, we are booked to which I responded, we have a reservation. Here is my reservation number, here is my date of the reservation. It did not matter to them because they said it was through bookit.com. The place was booked through bookit.com and I also do not recommend them in any fashion. It did not matter to them because they said it was through bookit.com. They refused to give us a cot because it would block the door, even if we moved the furniture around. Both Bourbon Orleans and Bookit.com kept putting blame on one another but in the end we stayed one night because we spent 4 hrs. being put on hold and arguing. We used AMEX to pay for the room so we called and cancelled the payments for the remaining nights, which were 3 of them.We ended up staying at the Marriot which had a room twice the size, a better view of the qtr, open bar on the top floor, and only 5 blocks form the Bourbon Orleans. I also saw a rat by the elevator of the Bourbon Orleans. The bathroom was in very poor shape also. I don't know if it was my room only but from the way they treated guests, I can see it carries over to the upkeep of the rooms.Overall impression was horrible. If I was a visitor for the first time I would have a very sour impression of New Orleans, thankfully, I had been to the city before and it did not ruin my love for New Orleans.Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. Sure the location is nice but the rooms are small, trust me, they are nothing special kinda like a motel 8, and the rates are ridiculous because it is on Bourbon St. Do yourself a favor and save the disappointment and go somewhere else."
"Review_13459","hotel_175","hotel_4989","May 10, 2008","Spoilt our trip ! Think twice. We travelled extensively throughout the United States during April and early May, and this hotel was the worst experience and spoilt the New Orleans portion of our trip.Do not rely on any promises about rooms if you book on the internet at this hotel. We booked and paid through the internet months ago (bookit.com) and arrived at this beautiful hotel which is let down completely by very poor management.The hotel itself is beautiful and wonderfully positioned. However, after traveling from the north to the south on Amtrak and arriving here exhausted, we expected to really enjoy the luxury portrayed. On presenting our paperwork from bookit.com to counter staff, she said our room which we had been promised was not available. We asked to see what was available, and it was very smelly and small. We said that we were not getting what we had paid for (which was supposed to be deluxe or better, and asked to speak to the manager. Receptionist said that the Customer Relations Manager was in a meeting. We waited nearly TWO hours at the desk exhausted, for someone to come to see us. Finally the Customer Relations Manager came out of the meeting and she was extremely cold. Just told us she couldn't help us as the promised room wasn't available. There was no apology, no attention, no compromise, not even a smile. She told us to take it up with bookit.com. We finally accepted a room that was available but was sub-standard and was not what we had paid for months ago. During the two hour wait for nothing, there were other people also upset about their rooms and wanting to talk to someone.The supposed available internet was a waste of time. You couldn't access your emails. On questioning staff about this, we were told they would do something tomorrow!! We witnessed many frustrated guests trying to access emails as most travellers rely on this. This was never rectified, and we heard that the system had actually been set up within the hotel so that you couldn't open emails and read them - probably so that the two computers were not tied up and used !! !!The hotel was being painted externally, and we were woken up at 7 a.m. some mornings with painters tapping on the windows scratching off old paint. The first morning we were woken early (8 a.m. approx) by housekeeping asking us if we had used anything from the bar fridge !!! Porters/bell boys were helpful and efficient and room service was good.We do not recommend this hotel, unless you are desperate for a central position."

A great location within walking distance of all the sites, with one side facing Bourbon St. The room itself was nothing special, pretty much what you'd expect. We didn't use the pool, located in an enclosed courtyard, but given the time, and a few more degrees, it would have been welcome. Don't expect free wireless, though there is a couple free-to-use PCs in the lobby. Parking is expensive ($20/day), but parking is a premium in the whole area. It was actually nice to let the valets take care of it...just give them about 10-15 minutes warning before you actually want to leave, since your car will be parked at one of two off-location lots, one 14 blocks away. Didn't try the hotel restaurant as there was plenty of other establishments to choose from in the area. Nothing outstanding, but wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

The room was decent sized for NOLA, but there were several problems.The worst were the paper-thin walls, if you're a light sleeper or don't party until the early hours, this is not the place for you. We heard every noise our neighbors made, even regular conversations carried through the walls. Also, even though our room was non-smoking, it smelled like it had been a smoking room for the past 30 years. We bought a fabreeze candle and it only partially helped with the odor. Finally there were other problems with the room such as the safe was not functioning (which is pretty important in a city like NO) and the cordless phone also didn't work. The swimming pool was not heated and mostly in the shade, so unless you go in the full heat of summer, its too chilly to swim."

"Review_13464","hotel_175","hotel_8360","Apr 10, 2008","NEVER AGAIN TRY ANOTHER HOTEL FIRST. We must have had the same server in the hotel restaurant that the previous reviewer had!! She also had issues with timely serving. When our breakfast order (for 4) was finely taken and farrived, we had to remind her about the cream for our coffee yet again. When it was delivered in a chipped one serving pitcher, we were told to share it); told us to get the jellies from the next vacant table (when asking about jam) and that she had to handle room service next--perhaps making this her excuse for poor service?!! I think management may be short on staff and are putting the wrong people in the wrong jobs due to labor shortages right now? We had a confirmed reservation number for a king bed, but upon check-in, computer said queen, and there was no changing that--sorry! So we paid king rates for a queen bed because the computer said there was a king bed in the room?!! This was really irritating as the hotel had availability and their internet server had a spring special going on, as well as an advertised queen rate. Never called and offered to move us, even upon asking of king availability (due to the fact the computer said we had a king room??) They didn't even come down and check the room to see--very strange!! Employee attitude was poor. At the beginning of our stay, we kept trying to explain ourselves and ask for a manager, we were informed we had been speaking to the manager (one of the desk help)(?!). We were only staying 3 nights, and didn't want to fight with staff the entire trip, so quit even trying as the frustration would ruin the trip. Room service order arrived incorrectly (no croissants that day) so delivered what they wanted, no call to see what else we'd like (we didn't dare wait and see how long it would take to correct the order--so ate it as is). Its a shame, cause the room we had (looking at the pool) was quiet and nicely furnished, great location, but I'd never stay there again.....if you do, get everything in writing prior to your stay, don't rely on the confirmation number."

First, our room was right by the second floor bar, and we had loud dance music blaring all night, plus drunk people trying to hook up right outside our door. We called security, but no avail. We were up every two hours both nights asking people to please go elsewhere. It was like staying outside a very loud brothel. Next, parking was $30 a night, something the hotel does not tell you until you are there with no choice. Even the Marriott only charges $10 a night for valet. Next, the $16 a head buffet breakfast (biscuits and fruit) was worth maybe $8 in New Orleans, and we were disappointed, when the table next to us was informed that waffles, omelets, pancakes, and French toast were also available with the buffet. When we asked our server, she said, Oh, yeah, well, I'm busy, I gotta do room service, too, and I didn't want to bother with you. It really set a terrible tone to our day. Finally, we were double charged for our room (charged twice the rate we were quoted, and I confirmed that rate when I checked in). When I asked the desk, I was told, Well, honey, we got your credit card number. Your only choice is do you want this credit card charged, or do you want to give me another one? I tried to talk to the manager, I tried everything, but I had been taken. Honestly, I go to New Orleans a lot, and I would recommend one of the well known hotels on Canal or a BB in the Marigny.

It was also the farthest room in the hotel to walk to. I specifically booked a Queen Suite, the hotel said sorry, but you didn't book with us and we can use our discretion when placing a guest in a room through a travel site. I think it was because I had a child with me. But the staff was inconsiderate when I asked if I could have a rollaway but they said the room was too small. Ridiculous. They told me they would change rooms the next day as there were no available rooms for the first night - not only did that not happen, but - the room next to my mothers was vacant the entire time (I asked the maid) and it was the room type we requested.Nothing was offered to fix our problem and nobody made any apologies.I have stayed at the Bourbon Orleans before and loved it.

The hotel is a few steps from canal street and about a 5 or 10 minute walk to the French Quarter. To help you locate it on a map, it is just down Camp Street, about half a block from the Sheraton. Loved the International House!"
"Review_13479","hotel_176","hotel_5194","Oct 14, 2008","Call ahead My husband and I were stunned to be put in a small room with no windows and a creepy door in the ceiling above the bed. We had booked a deluxe king room. Luckily there was a room with two full-size beds available that we were able to move to. We would have preferred a king, of course, since that is what we booked. But had the hotel been fully booked, we would have spent our weekend in what felt like a jail cell with a door above the bed! If you book a room here, you need to call the hotel directly and be sure that you are not the unlucky people stuck in these rooms, which, in my opinion should not be used as guest rooms at all. Apparently there are 5 of them. There is nothing on the International House website or the third party websites that indicate that these rooms exist... plus there is no price difference.On a positive note, the staff was nice, the hotel was well located, and the lobby was beautiful."

"Review_13481","hotel_176","hotel_5122","Oct 6, 2008","Not at all worth it My partner and I stayed at the International House for 5 nights for Jazz Fest in 2007. It was an awful experience for the following reasons:1. The room was filthy, dark and depressing. In particular, the decor wasn't at all what you would expect for a boutique hotel. Even though it had been recently remodeled, everything looked really dated and worn. The carpet had tears in it. The furniture was dinged up. The linens looked like they came from a thrift shop. And, to boot, the room was dirty and smelled of smoke (even though it was a non-smoking room). Worst of all, there was almost no natural light in the room, which, when combined with the dreary decor, made it feel like a prison cell.2. The walls were paper thin. We could hear all the noise from the hallway, as if those making it were standing in our room. During Jazz Fest, people are coming and going at all times of the night. If you're trying to sleep, watch out, as you will hear all the drunken wails from those returning from the bars.3. The lobby, while very chic, is usually crowded with those patronizing the bar they have there. It is loud and smells of alcohol. I know it is New Orleans, and one should expect some of this...but, I would have liked a little peace in the hotel after a day of craziness outside. Hard to get given that lobby.4. Front desk staff wasn't particularly helpful. In fact, one of them was downright rude if you ever asked for advice. We tried to get them to tell us the best way to get to the Fairgrounds, and for recommendations on places to eat. You would have thought we were asking for their left arm. I think the issue is that they are under-staffed, and were stressed because they couldn't get people checked in in a timely fashion...much less answer their questions.5. Not the best location. You aren't in the French Quarter. You aren't far from it, but you do have to walk several blocks. In the hot sun, it wasn't always a pleasant experience to do the walking. There are many hotel options in the French Quarter; in the future, I would choose one of these. And, the neighborhood in which the International House is in still hasn't undergone post-Katrina refurbishment, so is pretty run down (unlike the French Quarter).6. Rates were exorbitantly high for what you get. All in all, we would definitely stay somewhere else next time."

When I left the room 30 mins. later, we were told it was $30.00. I spoke to the parking manager, the front desk and the hotel manager and was told the same thing. The hotel manager said they do not park visiting guests and therefore you are treated as if you'd checked into the hotel. This was an outrage and unbelievable. The hotel patron we were visiting was so humiliated, he paid for our parking being that it was a business visit and there were 2 of us in 2 different cars! It doesn't matter if you are staying over night or there for 5 minutes, you will pay the same rate of $30.00. The front desk personnel all the way to the manager were not the least bit accommodating or willing to see the ridiculousness of 30.00 for parking, that is more expensive at the Ritz Carlton, New Orleans premier hotel!Be careful of Parking"

It was very convenient to the French quarter, CBD and the Warehouse district. Plus easy access to the Street Car. We booked a room for the weekend before Jazz Fest through the first weekend of Jazz Fest. Very nice bathroom, though the room was small , but very nicely appointed. No view. Quiet, very comfortable bed and lovely linen. This hotel has a most helpful staff. Available, knowledgeable but never intrusive. Great door men. A computer was available in the small comfortable and luxurious lobby. Charming bar that was very much a place to gather away from the hordes of tourist. My 93 year old exceptionally well traveled Mom thought it was a tad dark, but loved it none the less. Our only complaint was that there was no restaurant in the hotel, but I was told that a new one would be opening this fall. Not that we needed more food. Oh my! Great food nearby. We loved the art opening by a fine photographer of some works taken of a few of Nola's great musicians with complimentary wine served in the lobby one afternoon. Nice touch. We will be back again to this special hotel."

Also a fine location, quiet but easy walk to French Quarter or Warehouse district. But it is NOT anywhere near a luxury hotel as per their claim, at least in the standard rooms - our so-called Queen deluxe room was tiny, with a soft and lumpy double bed. I called to ask for another room, and was told that all the beds are the same. The upgrade to King would have cost another $100! (I'm not a large person, just don't like to roll into my husband in the middle of a sagging mattress). breakfast involved granola bars, a few apples and oranges, and terrible coffee. Shower only, no bathtub, no pool on premises, efficient but unenthused staff. Kind of disappointing all in all - it's such a fun city that you can easily get exhausted! -- it would be great to have a better room to relax in."

Stayed for 5 nights for a conference which included the last weekend of Jazz Fest 2008 and was down-right disgusted. Mod hotels (worth $359/night - yes, that's right, was Jazz Fest) should be impeccably clean- it was NOT. Tiles cracked in elevators and foyer, walls need painting, one handle missing on hotel's entry doors (for the whole week?), stains on carpets in the room, no minibar, etc, etc.... The first night I arrived, I got my own luggage out of the trunk of the cab (while the bellman with attitude watched me), then was given a room with no windows and a metal roof escape door in the ceiling. It rained and I got no sleep at all. The second night they moved me to LOFT 523 (sister property) across the street and put me in another dirty room over the bar. Again (although I am coming in at 1-2 AM), got no sleep due to people shouting at each other outside the bar all night! The third night, they moved me back to International House (after Jazz Fester's left) and I finally got some sleep. Friends stayed at Loew's - had great views, superclean rooms, great service, CHEAPER price. Pluses: the manager (although the rest of staff cannot make a decision without him), the bar drinks (although really slow in coming), ran into Tommy Lee at the bar and got a great photo with him. ROCK ON! but stay somewhere else."

I was very impressed by the quality of the hotel, especially for the price I got. It is literally about a minute or two walk and you're in the heart of the French Quarter area - GREAT!As for not having a restaurant, that was not a problem for me. There are SOOOO many great places to eat and try in New Orleans, I would be very surprised that anyone would want to eat a meal in their hotel. You are in New Orleans - get out and experience the cuisine of New Orleans! There are more places to eat than we had time for, so there's plenty of new places to eat when we return.And, you are in the party capital of the U.S., so why would you want to spend your time in a hotel room? I was looking for something reasonable in price and decent enough to sleep in - I got a lot more, considering some of the places I've stayed at that price. It is very, very nice."

The room was clean and perfectly adequate. I asked for a quiet room and I got it. The lobby is very nice and it has a small but very lively and trendy bar which I never went to, but was clearly popular among a nice crowd every night. The hotel is 5-10 minutes away from the French Quarter and the service was friendly and cooperative. My room was not cleaned the last night I stayed but I didn't care that much.

The location is great -- just five minutes from the French Quarter. The room was all right, although there was some noise from the air conditioning, the large fan above the bed and the toilets/showers/baths being used by other guests. The bathroom lights were on the lowest setting possible which meant I had to have my own shower pretty much in the dark. Only once I'd left did a colleague point out that there was a small lever next to the bathroom light switch which you could use to control the lighting."

"Review_13498","hotel_176","hotel_8901","Apr 7, 2008","a fun and friendly change from the cookie cutter hotels If you are familiar with hotels in europe, this one compares with more perks and better service.The hotel was MOST accomodating. We booked a four night weekend (Thursday thru Monday) through a third party website. After reading reviews here, I began to be concerned, because we were traveling as three...my daughter, my husband and I, in viewing her chosen new university Loyola. I did not want to be cramped in a small room or disappointed as we showed off the city to our daughter. I emailed them our information and asking for a larger room if possible and they wrote right back. The hotel could not have been nicer. They confirmed we were in a large superior double. They even offered to arrange a car service to pick us up at the airport, as we were arriving late on a Thursday evening. We had already gone ahead and booked a service, which the hotel confirmed was very reputable when I asked them for a reference.We arrived at about 11PM on Thursday evening. What a comfort to have low lighting, luscious smelling candles in the foyer and friendly faces to greet us after a long day. A group of guests, gathered around the large ottoman in the foyer, listening to a young girl and her guitar, gestured for us to join them. We would have loved to, had we not wanted so very much to change, unpack and find a nice corner in the inviting bar, Loa, in the lobby to unwind.Check in was a breeze. The doorman/security/bell captain, had our bags out of the sedan and into the hands of a very polite, friendly and capable bell service man, who carried them to our room, before we could even give direction. Our doorman/security was a kind gentlemen, friendly and truly happy to share a chat. My husband spent most of the four mornings enjoying his coffee on the hotels front steps chatting with the doormen, as he waited for the girls to get ready!After changing, we wandered back to the lobby and the bar for a drink. We found a cozy calming niche and my daughter, my husband and I enjoyed a cocktail and a glass of soda before retiring.The room itself was very large, as hotels go. It was room 305. A nice touch to have jazz playing when we walked in, We only experienced that once before, in a little inn in Newport RI. It spoke volumes to us about the hotel and their respect for our arrival. The window to the bedroom sat above the archway entry to the hotel. The attached full bath was enormous. It rivaled my home master suite. I have new plans for my home bath now :) The bathroom had an expansive glass picture window with dramatic sweeping ceiling to floor curtains, Italian travertine tile and a extra large glass walled walkin shower.Yes the lighting is low in the room. But after a day in the heat and humidity of New Orleans or an evening in the noise and smoke of a french quarter jazz bistro, we always found it soothing to come home to.Breakfast is a gracious offering of coffee, teas, large bowls of fresh whole fruits (apples, oranges and bananas when we were there) and granola bars. This is served in an intimate room off the lobby, with a couch, two extremely comfortable settee chairs and a flat screeen TV. It was a nice place to meet people. One morning I shared some time with Ann, who was in New Orleans for her sons wedding that evening. Runnning into her again the next day we shared details of our experiences- her wedding, my college tour. This I cannot find in the larger hotel settings. Another morning we exchanged breakfast banter with a young man who had close ties to where we live, although he now lives in California. This room was nice, but it does close after breakfast is through, which is disappointing, because it was quite relaxing. Maybe cold teas later in the day for the road weary could be worked into the schedule?The front desk was always eager to help. They made recommendations and reservations for us for dinners and brunches. On the morning we left (catching a 6AM flight!) They cheerily placed a wake up call to our room at 3:30am as we requested, then called back at 4am to see if we needed assistance with our bags. They arranged our taxi the night before and made sure the driver was on time. It seems they work with him often.Our time away and my daughters intro to New Orleans was made so much more special by the hotel. The bar was a quiet place for all three of us to relax on Saturday at 5PM..The room was relatively empty at that time and we were able to capture great window seats, on the comfortable settee and chairs, for some good people watching, scotch sipping chatter and debreifing. We felt revived in no time. Yet another night, upon returning from a days activities, we found a huge party going on in the foyer/lobby! What fun! Even the New Orleans fire department was there, as only can happen in NOLA, in their trucks and uniforms to enjoy the fete! It turns out it was a thank you party for a fundaiser which had been held earlier in the year. We were honored to be able to be a part of it- Had we known we would have made a donation!Yes the noise on the street can be heard, as in any city. I have stayed in NYC often and did not expect otherwise here. The Omni across the street has speakers on the otuside of their building. Light blues can be heard very faintly throughout the night. To those who love having a soundtrack to life, this was bliss for me.The beds are extremely inviting and decadent. I had a hard time getting out of them. Plenty of towels everyday. Facility staff who honor the privacy signs. A large walkin closet for hanging garments and a very charming armoire for drawer items and a small TV.The hotel sits on a small side street one block from Canal and one block from the St Charles Trolley. Could not be more convenient for walking to Vieux Carre, the Riverwalk and the Casino.We truly enjoyed our stay and will book again, as we return often for the next four years of my daughters college experience! If you want to capture the true spirit of New Orleans, this is the place"

Room was spacious and nicely decorated.Bathroom was lovely - and huge.The bad:We waited an hour past check-in time (4 PM) for our room to be ready. The lobby was packed with other people waiting. No apology was offered.They vastly overestimate the luxury of the place. Lots of the amenities they advertised weren't there. Examples:- No minibar- No flowers in the room- No down comforters- No restaurant (closed for renovation)I didn't need any of those things, so I was relatively happy with the place. I thought it over-sold itself, though, and I agree with the reviewer who said it's trying to hard to be hip. It's a nice hotel - they should drop the pretension and work on the basics."

The hotel is chic and cozy, the bar downstairs brings a nice feel and the hotel music is like non-other. After booking with their sister hotel (Loft 523) for All-star Weekend, my friends and I were moved to IH becasue of plumbing problems in our room at the Lofts. Even though it was a little frustrating for me to convey to the hotel management that as a customer they needed to do anything and everything possible to accomodate for the incovenience me and my friends were experiencing, I'm glad they were able to provide us with a room considering almost all the hotels were at capacity for a great NBA event. PROs: We stayed in room 601! The staff was extremely nice and friendly. The location is great and far enough off canal to miss the noise and get some rest after coming in at 5am but close enough to walk to bourbon and the casino without worries. Located close to a secured atm (24 hour security officer in locked building ask front desk they'll direct you around the corner), liquor stores, restaurants, and a walgreens that came in handy due to airport restrictions which tossed all of my friends toiletries in the trash. Beds are pretty comfortable, the bathroom was newly remodeled although the sinks were built weird and the showers are huge for a hotel. Requests for towels, extra blankets, pillows were always delivered quickly. And they have a public computer downstairs to access the internet and wireless services throughout the hotel.CONs: The biggest problem we had was outlet plugs...normal hotels have more ourlets in the rooms rather than the bathroom but this hotel was reversed and frustrating when trying to charge your phone and put on make-up. Lighting is very dim in the rooms as well, the use of two lamps is not suffiecient but it was only a problem when dressing, with 5 females everyone cant be in the bathroom at once; but it was great at night, light can hurt a little when coming in late from bourbon street. The refrigerators do not cool and the mini freezer inside is worthless, but request a bucket of ice and you'll be great. I don't suggest keeping food inside, it might spoil. Overall my experience to New Orleans post-katrina was not bad at all. I've been to New Orleans plenty of times before katrina but this was the first post and its definitely worth visiting. The city is still rebuilding but the spirit is what makes New Orleans a great destination. And its not a bad option to choose International House as your hotel choice during that experience."

I was in town in Febuary for Mardi Gras and I loved the hotel. I frequently visit New Orleans and International House is the hotel I always stay at and will always return to. When you walk into the hotel, the lobby is large with high ceilings and redish furniture. The front desk is fun and smart. They know everything about the city and they know your name. They always tell me hi when I walk by and always ask me how dinner was. I was checked in really fast and went to my room quickly as I wanted to get to the parade. My room was 508. It was large with a king size bed. It had a chandelier with a large full length mirror. I had lots of windows and a view of the city. The room was a New Orleans style but with a comtemporary twist. The hotel offers valet parking which is very convienent. There is a 24 hour fitness center and the Loa bar is hot. In the morning, the hotel serves coffee, herbal tea, gronola bars, and fruit. At night the lobby is candle lit and the music is changed to fun upbeat vibe. I will be back as I have been at International House several times. I have always been blown away by there style and fashion and they change things up from time to time so you never get bored."
"Review_13505","hotel_176","hotel_5755","Feb 7, 2008","Intimate Boutique Hotel that Never Disappoints I love this hotel, it's pretty much my customary lodging when I am in New Orleans (every 3-4 months or so). I was most recently there during Mardi Gras and the hotel handled the increase in foot traffic, chaos and revelry just wonderfully. I love the decor. The hotel is in a beautiful, historic building with a thoroughly stylish and modern interior. It's so unique and appealing. I also enjoy the bar - the drinks and decor. It would work in any large metro city. The front desk staff is young and they can be a little standoff-ish, but that doesn't bother me at all. The bellman, Jerry, is wonderful - he knows the town and knows just about everyone in it. He always remembers us when we return. The rooms can be a little small, but I typically am only in the rooms to sleep and get dressed. I try to always get a corner room which is a bit larger and has a nice seating area. While my room during Mardi Gras was not directly on Canal Street, it did face Canal Street and I heard a lot of the street noise. Again, though - what can you expect? It didn't bother me at all. I have had a similar room recently and was not bothered by noise whatsoever. I fully believe it was just the Mard Gras madness. The location is wonderful. It's in the CBD, but it's just a stone's throw from the Quarter (keep in mind I am someone who likes to walk). This is thoroughly a boutique hotel and may not be for some people. However, if you are looking for something stylish, ecletic, charming and not exorbitantly priced, this hotel will exceed every expectation."
"Review_13506","hotel_176","hotel_9780","Jan 31, 2008","Just Dreadful I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. The experience I had at this hotel was absolutely awful and this opinion was shared by over a dozen other guests who were there for the same meeting. Myself and numerous others truly think the very stagnant uncirculated air in the hotel rooms made several people sick. The room I was given had no window--I don't mean no operable window, or no view, I mean no window, not even a window on to an internal ventilation shaft. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom or any other type of fan in the room, as a result the air in the room never changed and remained dank and musty. Housekeeping service was a joke. They failed to service my room one day, even after I went to the front desk and politely asked them to have my room serviced. The hotel bills itself as this chic boutique sort of place, but you must get the very basics of hotel management in place first. I was at the hotel for a meeting of roughly 100 people, all occupying the hotel--we arrived on Sunday, by Tuesday, more than 10 people had moved to other local hotels. The only positive thing I can convey is that the front desk staff was polite and courteous to me, although not all guests shared the same good fortune. I am sure at one time this may have been a fine hotel, but I can not in good conscience recommend this hotel to anyone."

This is an OK place, not great. The rooms are small. I mean european small. No evening turn down service or fresh towels. The front desk is quite helpful and the location is good. There is nowhere to eat in the motel and you have to walk to the Sheraton or Hilton to find a place in the evening. Only one doorman who was getting kind of stressed with a bunch of people leaving on Sunday morning. The most obvious thing I would suggest is turn down the lobby music. When we checked in it was playing classic rock so loud that we could not hear the guy at the desk. If you get a good price it is ok to stay here but at the full price I am really kind of luke warm about the International House."
"Review_13508","hotel_176","hotel_5286","Jan 21, 2008","great little place, great location I was fortunate to tag along on a quick business trip with my husband this past weekend to New Orleans. We stayed at IHH for 2 nights. The hotel is lovely. Very posh, but very comfortable. The entire city of New Orleans is quite easy and comfortable. You can make the experience your own easily. The lobby is so beautiful and the Loa bar a great stopping point before and after dinner. The entire staff is so easy going and laid back but the atmosphere is so much more elegant!! We were upgraded to the Penthouse floor. Our room was not a PH suite, but was nice and comfortable. We had a balcony with seating - but was too cold and rainy to utilize. I am somewhat concerned with previous reviews that mention bad views from their rooms. This hotel is in the city. EVERY room will have a view of a brick wall or parking lot or alley or all these city fixtures. When in NYC - we almost always have a brick wall view - it's the city!! It was quiet on the 12th floor except for the after party that consumed the PH hallway on Sunday from 3:30 am until 6:45 am. When I called the front desk to ask them to please quiet down the neighbors, the young woman seemed somewhat taken aback by my request. However, within minutes we heard doors shut and more muffled voices than the squealing right outside our door. This is an OLD restored building. NOT very sound proof. For a light sleeper (like myself) this could possibly pose a problem. The hotel was clean and the staff very accomodating and helpful. Jason - you are great and so fun to talk with. Your knowledge of all the restaurants was in-valuable! There is NO restaruant at the hotel-which upset some-but there is NO LACK of places to eat in NO! Walk just feet in any direction and you can find great food. We walked EVERY where. It was very cold and I was in heels the entire weekend but had no problem getting around. Merchants are lovely, kind and gracious at restaurants, boutiques, eateries, souvenir shops and antique stores. All wanted to visit and chat and know where we were from. Very nice people in NO. Of course we visited Cafe de Monde and were not dissapointed. Great coffee and beinets as always. WARNING - CDM is ALWAYS crowded!!!! But they are quick and the service is good. Beinets HOT and yummy. I would also recommend MR B's - close by- for a casual dinner or Sunday brunch. Don't pass up the HUGE bar-b-Q shrimp at Mr. B's! My husband ordered the quail - very large dish and wonderful (waiter mentioned they do not have quail very often, get it if its on menu - you will not be disappointed). Cuvee was also wonderful - elegant (we dressed up) but also easy casual if you prefer. One of the BEST meals I have had on travels (we travel a LOT). We walked the 2 blocks from hotel in 25 degrees with wind (me in heels) - but no problem. Ate quick breakfast at Fleur de Lis (close-by also) which was very good. If you have time to sit and eat an omelet - they have wonderful cajun concoctions not to be missed. Overall - NO was a great weekend get-away. Wish we could have stayed another day or 2! We will be back."

I absolutely loved this place鈥he staff was incredibly nice, the lobby was gorgeous and the rooms were very relaxing, neat, clean and stylish. When my friend and I checked in, the manager was there and preceeded to give us a tour of the hotel, as well as telling us all the events that were going on during the week (we were there one August, a few years ago). After such a nice reception, we entered a nice, dimly lit room that had soft music playing in the background; a great touch. My only complaints would be that there was really nothing else on the street of interest, besides the hotel, and our view was nothing spectacular at all. Highly recommend!"

Their excellent customer service extends beyond the front desk, including special events planning (I stayed here for a wedding earlier in the year, which was also held at the hotel). Their entire staff from room/ guest services, to housekeeping/ room attendants, continuously delivered exemplary service and demonstrated we were the most important guest they had staying with them! We will always stay at the Maison Dupuy and suggest you do the same! They get the importance of excellence and it is demonstrated in all that they do! I'd also like to say a special Thank you to Dana Crabtree in their Reservation Dept. She was instrumental in ensuring my husbands R  R visit from his deployment in the Middle East was the most memorable time we've had in a loooong time! You're awesome, Dana! Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on this hidden treasure and have an awesome remainder of the week !"
"Review_13515","hotel_177","hotel_6987","Dec 21, 2008","A few quirks but we would definitely stay again On one of our tours the guide said that the number one problem these days is a shortage of employees and to be understanding if places are a little short staffed. Remembering that served us well throughout the City and in particular at the Maison Dupuy.The Basics: We had an amazing deal - $89/night for a king deluxe with balcony overlooking the courtyard. We stayed for five nights from Sunday to Friday. We would definitely stay here again but also have a few minor recommendations that would bring the hotel to that next level. Also, this is a great place if you like boutique hotels that aren't chains or lacking in character like we do. If you're looking for slick or predictable it may not be the place for you.The Bad: The bathroom amenities functioned; however, the drain, tub spout, and door handle seemed in need of minor repair. The bathroom itself could have been a bit cleaner with the help of a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser taken to the walls. Again, this is MINOR and the good far outweighed these issues.The Good: We loved the staff - the service was excellent and very friendly. They allowed us to check out late without penalty on our final day, which was definitely appreciated. We had a wonderful room overlooking the beautiful courtyard where we enjoyed breakfast on the balcony one morning and the hot tub several evenings. The location was terrific - within walking distance of everything in the Quarter but far enough from Bourbon to feel a bit quieter. The French Bistro, their on-site cafe, was decently priced with friendly service. We did not eat at Dominique's, the fine dining restaurant.As the hotel continues to make renovations and come back in full force a few suggestions: 1) Provide robes in room; 2) Add more art to the rooms; 3) carry the Times-Picayune rather than USA Today (as a boutique hotel rather than a chain it seemed a shame to carry USA Today over the local paper) and 4) especially in the king sized rooms, add a little bar area with a coffee maker, mini fridge, and microwave.Again though, a terrific place, friendly people, and we will very likely return again."
"Review_13516","hotel_177","hotel_5740","Dec 17, 2008","Maison Dupuy a Class Act Maison Dupuy was an excellent experience for a seven-day visit recently. We were treated very graciously by a professional, courteous staff. The hotel reservation person helped us plan and fit within our budget, applying appropriate AAA discounts. All the prices were as advertised over the telephone.Parking was a piece of cake. We drove into the hotel lot so we were safely off the street. Our car was presented to us very quickly whenever we wanted to use it. If we left an item in the car it was retrieved by the attendant with no hassles.The front desk staff was very accommodating, including explaining charges, credit card holds for incidentals etc. The hotel is a couple of blocks off Bourbon, so there was solitude in the evening.The courtyard is very appealing with an exquisite fountain, pool and jacuzzi. Special events such as weddings are held there and during those times the courtyard might be unavailable (which is posted at the front desk. If you request a courtyard balcony, you can listen to the music if there is an event. The bands have to cut off the music at 10pm. We requested and were granted an upgrade to a larger room with balcony (exterior) that overlooked Toulouse Street.The hotel is clean, fresh smelling with marble for the bathroom sinks and floors giving an elegant touch. The beds/sheets were extremely comfortable. The initial room could have had a few more drawers for storage. We enjoyed the larger room as it helped let us spread out a little more.We ran out of kleenex one day and housekeeping promptly brought another box--refusing the tip that we offered. A small grocery is just a couple of blocks toward Bourbon Street. A free morning coffee service in the lobby serves a house blend that is one of the best i've ever tasted. The bar in the bistro had a friendly, helpful staff. Dominiques restaurant seemed elegant with friendly staff, although we didn't dine there. They had an interesting new menu that would appeal to many.From our courtyard room, we witnessed a wedding on Saturday night and soaked in the music from the reception. Maison Dupuy is well-situated and within a couple of minutes, you can experience the nightlife of bourbon street or walk the shops/museums of Royal Street. Jackson Square is close by as well. Snug Harbor on Frenchman Street has great jazz/blues and dinner...a short taxi ride away, or walk via Decatur Street during the day. The Orleans Collection is a museum/house tour that is free and gives you a sense of what it's like to live with a courtyard in the Quarter. Check out the tour times, which are offered several times a day. The ladies have to visit the fancy hat store on Royal."
"Review_13517","hotel_177","hotel_4714","Dec 4, 2008","Very Charming; Great Place Our travel agent booked this hotel for us for a short business meeting. I was very pleased. Apparently this is an older historic hotel which went through a MAJOR remodel after Hurrican Katrina. (Someone said $50 million remodel). They did a top class job. Retained the older historic look and feel, but with a clean feel.As for location, it is about 2-3 blocks from Bourbon Street. Far enough away, that was quiet (in early December when we were there), but close enough to the fun stuff that everyone enjoyed it. Perfect location!The centerpiece of the facilities was a courtyard with a beautiful fountain and a pool (although it was way to cold to use the pool). The guest rooms were not large or modern, but were nicely laid out and were what one should expect for a historic hotel.Even though I was there for business, I brought my family, including three young children. We stayed in the parlor suite. It was perfect for our family. It had a room with a king size bed, and a separate parlor (a smaller room with a TV and a sofa, which pulled out as a bed). Once we had a crib brought in for my youngest, the parlor suite was perfect for us.The bathroom was nicely updated with lots of marble and granite and a nice bathtub and a massage showerhead. My only complaint about the room was the lack of personal coffee maker, which has become fairly standard in hotels these days. But that problem was quickly offset by the caraffes of free coffee in the lobby each morning.The staff was very accommodating and helpful. Since I was there for business, we utilized the meeting room and had great dealings with the group meeting staff. Paul Perez was very helpful and willing to do what it took to make our small group happy.I would like to go back someday with just my wife and enjoy the historic place with close proximity to the fun, without having to spend my time in business meetings."

"Review_13519","hotel_177","hotel_7499","Nov 7, 2008","Good Experience I did near exhaustive research to find the right place for my wife and I to stay on our Halloween trip to the French Quarter. And after weeks of this research, I was still uncertain so we held reservations at 4 places in the quarter, right down to the last date we could still cancel with no penalties...and at the last minute we pulled the trigger on Maison Dupuy. WHEW!!! Couldn't be happier.I have been to the Quarter twice before. I have family who was displaced from Chalmette in Katrina but still lives in the area. And an uncle who was a Quarter beat cop for 20yrs. On top of all of their advice, and my previous experiences, I must have read at least a dozen reviews of at least 25 hotels. After taking all of that in to consideration, then checking prices, availability, etc...it came down to Maison Dupuy, Chateau LeMoyne, Bourbon Orleans, and The French Market Inn.Lemoyne jacked their advertised price when I called so they were out. The French Market Inn was a bitt too far towards the river for our likes. And Bournon Orleans, altho with the best location, had horrrrrible internet reviews. So despite it's close proximity to the northern edges, and notoriously less safe areas of the Quarter, we chose Maison Dupuy.What we found was easy driving access. When coming in off Interstate 10, all you do is take the Vieaux Carre/Orleans Ave Exit and head Downtown following the signs to the Quarter and then there is a VERRRY clear sign that says FRENCH QUARTER VIA TOULOUSE. Well, just follow that and Maison Dupuy is a block down in to the Quarter on Toulouse.Parking in the Quarter has skyrocketed since Katrina. The Hotel wanted $28 a night so I drove around to find street parking and got a spot about 1/2block away. We checked in, and found what seems to be the case at every hotel out there in the Quarter==a snooty desk attendant. An effeminate black guy who treated me like I was the biggest [--] he'd ever seen. He assured me parking was as cheap there as anywhere. Knowing there used to be $10-20 garages, I took a ride around after we checked in. He was almost right. Cheapest places we found were like $24 a day. And since the $28 at the hotel kept the car right there for us, and it was valet parked==it was sadly, the best option. But plan on adding $30($28 plus at least a couple bucks for tip) a day to your stay at this hotel.The hotel lobby was decent. The elvator was excellent. In our couple days there, we only had to take the stairs a couple times(just b/c we like exercise and don't like to wait long)...but the elevator was almost always there within seconds of hitting the call button. The hallways had a slight funky smell, but if you can't stand some funky smells that run the gamut from pleasant to foul and all points in between, then the French Quarter is NOOOOT the place to go.Our room was very adequate. We knew going in that we didn't get a courtyard or street view, so we were OK with our view of the backs of buildings. The windows were painted shut, and appeared to have been so for 50yrs. But the AC worked fine(as did the heat, as we had wildly varying temps on our trip) so we were able to de-stale/refresh the room air pretty adequately. The stories of poor water pressure at this hotel, and in the FQ in general, are either flat wrong, or we just got lucky b/c we had fantastic water temps and pressure all weekend. Plenty of towels. The maid service was fantastic. Reallllly super friendly ladies. By the way, the valet guys were pretty friendly and heldful too. We had an ice machine 2 doors away. And the next floor up had another ice machine and a soda machine within a couple doors of the stairwell($2 per soda tho...but again, you're on vacation, so expect it). Our TV remote was broken and they sent someone from engineering up within 5mins. Nice guy who addressed me as Mr, had a hotel shirt on, and fixed the problem(just had to re-set the inputs in the rear of TV) within a couple mins and was gone. Excellent cable service, and in-room movies. We never got room service, so we can't speak to that.The hotel has two restaurants. Dominiques is quite fancy schmancy and has an excellent breakfast buffett. The courtyard is dynamite and was to host a wedding while we were there. there was about 10-12 balcony rooms, which we will be sure to get one next time. The pool was nice, but too cold to swim in at this time of year. But we spent an hour in the hot tub one morning over the decent free coffee, and free newspaper you get in the lobby....and the hot tub is excellent. really hot, plenty of room, etc.The location is freaking DYNOMITE! Quarter blocks aren't like regular city blocks. They are about 75-100ft tops. And the Maison Dupuy is literally a smidge over two Quarter blocks from the very heart of the party section of Bourbon. Close enough to make the Tropicle Isle in 2mins, but far enough away so that the hustle and bustle isn't too much at any time. Put it this way: despite it's being up by Toulouse and Burgundy, I still made Cafe DuMonde for Beignets one morning and BACK up to the room all in less than a half an hour. Left the room, elevator, walked down, waited in line, walked back, and up to room in about 25mins. So any location concerns should be thrown out the window.Overall, considering the location, price, amenities, etc....the experience was excellent!!"

I called the front desk before our trip and asked for a courtyard view. On arrival we were told by the somewhat arrogant manager that he could not grant our request. Once in our room we noticed we had a remote control with no batteries, low water pressure, and no ice or drink machine on our floor. On the positive side, the breakfast each day was wonderful although somewhat pricey.It was very convenient to everything and we felt safe walking around the area. The hot tub was the best! Really had hot water and could hold several people. Courtyard is beautiful and very peaceful setting. We would stay there again when we come back to NOLA."

The hotel was clean, the staff was very nice and attentive, and the location was good. We were only a 4 block walk to the center of the French Quarter. We found that we didn't need a car except for shopping on Magazine Street/Garden District (which we recommend skipping). We had a balcony room with a private balcony (recommended). There are a lot of weddings that the hotel hosts but that just gave us something to do between 6:30-7:30 PM. All the outdoor noise settles down by 10:30 PM. When there are weddings planned you have use of the courtyard and pool until 4 PM. A lot of guests watched the lovely outdoor ceremonies from their baclonies. We event got a bottle of wine on the last night to settle in for the show. We were very comfortable at the DuPuy. One thing to note is that their restaurant, Dominque's is EXCELLENT but a little pricy, as is their breakfast buffet. We would recommend it for first timers to NOLA."

The hotel staff was helpful and pleasant. One notable exception was a very bad front desk staff man who clearly did not enjoy his job, nor did he understand the meaning of reservations. He was easily recognizable by the fact that he had a horrible nail biting habit. He did not understand that when one reserved and paid for a specific room one should get it. Fortunately, other staff was there to help. We had a wonderful balcony room and got to enjoy the wedding parades as they passed by. Breakfast buffets at Dominique's was great. We were always pleasantly fortified for our days adventures. While it is close to Rampart we had no problems and there was never too much noise. Like any city you have to be aware of your surroundings and everyone was helpful about where to go. We were walking distance tours and hot spots in the french quarter. While there was not much evidence of hurricane damage where we were on tours it was extremely evident and very sad. We were amazed at the positive attitude of the people that lived there and their love of their city. The food, the people, the culture, and the history of the city made this a truly memorable vacation and one I recommend to all. I would highly recommend the hotel to all."

There is a reason so many incentives are listed for this hotel. 1) It is in a terrible location wayyyyy too close to Rampart St. 2) Very noisy..it is French Quarter, but this wasn't festive noise. 3) Do not let them valet park your car. The valet curbed my rims and scratched my door terribly. Now, management will not return my phone calls after the parking supervisor, Marvin, said that it happened there. 4) The staff is very rude. While explaining my car damage, the customer service representative accused me of being rude and hung up on me. Before she was able to hang up, I heard her call me a STUPID WHITE GUY. 5) Antonio Davis is the hotel manager. I have made many phone calls to him that have gone unreturned.Save yourself the hassle and stay at one of the good hotels in a better location with a higher caliber of staff.

I have to say that we had a wonderful time. We checked in late on Wed. night and were given a mediocre room, seemed like the night staff did not really know what they were doing. But the next day we got up and were given another room with a wonderful view of the courtyard. Just a little info: they do not have mini bars or fridges in the room. They say they do but they do not. We were told that they were in the process of getting them in. And some rooms do not have an in room safe. Our first room did not but the second one did which I wanted to have. We also were given half off our whole stay on parking which is $28, put it down to $14 a day for us. And just so you know that is anywhere you go and if you park it there you know it is safe. The valet guys were all super nice, so was everyone else that worked there. The beds are to die for. I swear we did not get out of the bed till 11am every day. They were so comfy. They were always accomidating to as to when they cleaned our room. Our sheets were chnged every day and we got fresh towels with no problems. They have a lovely courtyard and pool. I read other reviews about it being taken up on weekends with weddings. Well we did not have any weddings while we were there. But we did not go there to hang at the pool anyway. We have one at home so that was the last thing on our plans. And it is in a perfect location! It is right down from Bourbon street and right next to the main road (rampart) which is right by the police station and the famous St. Louis Cemetary No. 1. We walked everywhere we went for the whole week. I am sure there are nicer hotels but for the price and location you just can not beat it. Our room was normally $489 a night before tax and we got ours for $86 through expedia. I did shop around and they had the best price.I have so many tips on things to see and do: I will write reviews on them in the correct places, but here are some of them.Restaurants:GW FinsJohnny Po BoysFranks ItalianCentral GroceryThe Market CafeThe Corner CafeChartres House CafePlaces to See:The CathedralJackson SquareMake sure you taste the creamy original pralines!St. Louis Cemetary No. 1, houses Marie Laveau's Tomb (we took many photos there and have actually came back home and found ghost images in them)St. Louis Cemetary No. 2, 3Ride the St. Charles TrolleyWe drove to the garden distrist by Tulane and went to the famous Lafeyette cemetary where Interview with a Vampire was filmed and all the Anne Rice books are writen after.We walked up and down all the side streets and went in and out of all the shops which was fun.Of course there is Bourbon street: not very kid friendly at all! One end of the street is mainly strip clubs but once you pass them then you are into your bars. If you like to drink you have to get a hand grenade from Tropical ISle but be careful they are strong but yummy.Also go on the Southern Comfort Walking Tour through Gray Line Tours. I heard it was great! You go to historic bars and they tell you about there special drinks and you get a chance to tatste them. I would definitely reccomend the Old Absinthe House! Ask them the history behind absinthe and get you one! They are $19 for one glass but it is the most interesting thing! Look up Absinthe and read about it before you go. It was definitely an experience.We ended up at Razoo most nights for the happy hour and the crowd watching. Plus most of the bars let you bring in your drink and they have no covers.Last thing we did was go to the Lower 9th Ward. Dont let anyone tell you it is not safe, that's just crazy. Of course dont go at night but if you go in the middle of the day it is fine. We drove our own car down there which is very close to the frech quarter. There were a ton of people about and lots of workers so no reason to feel threatened. We went to the exact spot where the levee broke during hurricane katrina and viewed many destryoed homes. It will put a new perspective on all that you have and all that we should be doing to help. It is just so sad that even after three years most all of the homes are still gone or abandoned.If you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"Review_13526","hotel_177","hotel_4163","Aug 19, 2008","By FAR our favorite NO hotel!! We have stayed at the Maison DuPuy many times over the years and we are never disappointed. The Maison DuPuy is by far our favorite New Orleans hotel. It is 2 blocks from Bourbon Street in the Quarter, so it is close enough for all of the partying yet far enough away to be quiet. It is very clean and attractive, but above all, its staff is extremely helpful and friendly. During our recent stay, we found a couple of minor problems in our room. One of the bed-side lamps had a broken switch and would not turn on, and we were missing a TV remote control. I called the front desk and within 5 minutes an engineer was at our door with a new lamp and a remote. Being Innkeepers ourselves, we understand when there is a minor problem with a room. The key is how it is addressed by the staff when brought to their attention. We couldn't have been more pleased with their prompt response. For the price, this hotel can't be beat. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Maison DuPuy to anyone traveling to New Orleans."
"Review_13527","hotel_177","hotel_7224","Aug 8, 2008","Perfect New Orleans Experience Our arrival at the Maison Dupuy was greeted by valet (Marvin is awesome!) and we were taken into the small yet gorgeous lobby. Our room was smaller than we thought and obviously old, but it was still a great stay on an extremely comfortable bed.Watch your balcony preference, because the balconys on the street are shared with 3 other rooms and can get loud. (We heard a fight happening one night) We never saw any of the other balcony sharing guests, so I guess we lucked out on keeping our chairs outside. Hotel is about a 3 minute walk to Bourbon Street, and retains such an old world charm, we loved it. HINT* Skip the hotel breakfast and go over to Petunia's before 9:00. The food is so New Orleans authentic, the french toast is out of this world, and the lines are crazy after 9:30 so go early. Only a 2 block walk from the hotel, ask Marvin or hotel staff for direction.Only bad review is that we left an item in our room and called every day for 2 weeks trying to recover it. Hotel did not call us, we had to keep calling them to check status. Never found our item, didn't act like they were even looking for it."

The staff is friendly and helpful, there's a guard posted outside if you park your car there, and the pool is welcoming on a sweltering day. However, because of the budget friendly accomodations, our room window faced a brick wall. Eh...whaddya goonna do? It's 2 blocks from Burbon St, which is close enough to stumble home, but far enough to where you don't hear the excitement. :) I would stay there again."
"Review_13530","hotel_177","hotel_2049","Jul 31, 2008","Wonderful, charming hotel -- absolutely first rate Fabulous hotel. We stayed here once before -- right before Katrina in August 2005. It was wonderful then, it is even better now. Terrific service. Great buffet breakfast in Dominique's -- a four star restaurant. The rooms are pretty, the pool is beautiful and well-maintained, and the location is close to Bourbon street, but far enough away to get a good restful night's sleep. Everything is within walking distance. This hotel has it all. It's perfect for young couples, and young families -- older folks and old families, just about anybody who wants to experience the French Quarter and all that New Orleans has to offer. The rates were right, too. If you've never been to New Orleans, this is the way to go!"
"Review_13531","hotel_177","hotel_7113","Jul 4, 2008","Value, Location,  My family and I spent a week at the Maison Dupuy at the end of June 2008, and I felt we received an exceptional value. With New Orleans still suffering from the havoc Katrina wreaked on the tourism industry, the hotels are all but giving rooms away. I almost felt guilty for staying at such a nice hotel at the paltry rate of $89/night. I would have easily paid two to three times that rate for the same room in another historical destination such as Savannah or Charleston! Not only did we receive a bargain rate, we were given half-off the $28/day parking fee, and the internet access was complimentary, although it is not indicated as such on the hotel鈥檚 website or on TripAdvisor.I had read some less-than-positive reviews before booking at the Maison Dupuy, and I can address all of the unflattering comments. One reviewer had made the comment that the pictures on the internet were misleading, and I can assure you, the rooms are EXACTLY as pictured on the hotel鈥檚 website. The bathrooms aren鈥檛 as glitzy as the one shown on the internet, but the one they feature is in the Honeymoon Suite, and they represent it as such. As a matter of fact, the bathrooms were quite nice, with marble tiles and granite countertops. Perhaps they were a bit small, but the Maison Dupuy touts itself as a boutique hotel, and make no mistake, boutique hotels usually have cramped rooms; however, in this case, these are the largest rooms I have ever encountered in a boutique hotel. Another comment I had read was that the d茅cor was a throwback from the 鈥?0s. I don鈥檛 know where this person had been in the 鈥?0s, but I think the rooms all look very tastefully done and up-to-date. The incredibly comfy beds all feature the fluffy white duvets and mounds of pillows, with the woven throw folded at the foot of the bed (never saw that in the 鈥?0s!) The furnishings were the typical antique reproduction hotel stock, but the upholstery and draperies were all very good quality and quite elegant in a conservative, traditional sense. Our room had an unbeatable view of the courtyard, which was lush and beautiful. The entire hotel had real brass accents, not the fakey polished brass junk that was popular in the 鈥?0s. I think they had a staff member who was solely dedicated to constantly polishing the brass!Someone had mentioned a musty odor which permeated the facility. I did not experience that at all, and if there is a questionable smell, I will be the first to detect it! Possibly there had been some water damage following Katrina, but if someone had noticed mustiness in the past, it is gone now.Another reviewer had complained about the weddings in the courtyard which interfered with their ability to utilize everything they felt they had paid for. Come on, now! The reason the courtyard is in such high demand for weddings is because it is so beautiful鈥e appreciative for having the good fortune to stay in a hotel with such a lovely courtyard, don鈥檛 complain about not getting to use it for an afternoon or two! We arrived on a Saturday, and it was the only day we were unable to use the courtyard/pool area. Anyway, it wasn鈥檛 closed all day, just from 5 pm until about 11 pm. My daughter loved feeling like an uninvited spectator at a wedding鈥t was all very breathtaking! I don鈥檛 think there is any real danger of experiencing severely compromised pool privileges as a result of constant weddings. Most brides who go through enough trouble to secure such a lovely location only get married on Saturdays, and only at night, when it isn鈥檛 a zillion degrees outside. I think, out of the whole week, it is not such an inconvenience having to sacrifice the pool for a few hours. We had a marvelous stay at the Maison Dupuy. From the bartender at the Bistro who remembered that my daughter preferred a pile of cherries on her ice cream sundaes to guest services to the wait staff in Dominiques to the valets to the housekeeping staff, we had phenomenal service. The only minor inconveniences we experienced was that the alarm clock in our room was broken, our clean towels were not delivered at all one day (we 鈥渂orrowed鈥?some from the pool), and on an occasion or two we were awakened by people loudly conversing in the hallways in the wee hours of the morning; however, I must admit it is not the hotel鈥檚 fault that some people are inconsiderate! We couldn鈥檛 hear a thing from the rooms around, above, or below us. We didn鈥檛 even hear noise from the wedding in the courtyard. The incidents mentioned above were such minor nuisances, that I feel silly for even mentioning them. Had I paid $489 per night, which was the rate posted on the back of the door to our room, I might have been very slightly annoyed. For $89 a night, I am thrilled that it was as impeccably clean, comfortable, and safe as we found it to be.  I will gladly tell you what everyone in New Orleans is begging for us to tell you鈥o, have a great time, and tell everyone you know to go, too. They are desperate for your tourism dollars. I just regret that I will probably never be able to afford to stay at the Maison Dupuy again once New Orleans gets back on its feet. Take my advice and go now while you can still take advantage of a great deal on a lovely hotel."
"Review_13532","hotel_177","hotel_8777","Jul 2, 2008","Always consistent This was our 4th stay at the Maison DuPuy and once again, we had a great time. We opted for a larger room with a balcony over Toulouse St. instead of the courtyard. Did we hear a little extra noise on Saturday night from revelers? Of course, but that was just one night. The rest of our 4 night stay was quiet and wonderful. If you want to be guaranteed a quiet room, take one of the smaller rooms facing the courtyard."

We found ourselves without a place to stay and chose New Orleans as our next stop. I am so glad we did.The folks at the Maison Dupuy saved our honeymoon. We arrived after a long flight very late in the evening. The staff had our room ready and even sent up a cheese plate, bottled water and a bottle of champagne to our room. It was so nice to finally feel like we had our special honeymoon!The hotel is located a few blocks from Bourbon Street and a short walk from Lower Decatur and has a beautiful pool.hot tub area off of the courtyard. We stayed here in 2006 and had just as great of a time as we did this time. I can't say enough nice things about the Dupuy. Try it for yourself."

"Review_13535","hotel_177","hotel_9813","Jun 24, 2008","Just steps away from Bourbon! A beatiful hotel with very friendly and efficient staff. The MD is located just 2 blocks away from Bourbon Street, and that's just far away enough to enjoy a peacful nights sleep after a fun night on Bourbon. Valet service was very quick. Check-In took less than 5 minutes. Our room was very clean, and had a king size bed that was more comfortable than our bed at home! We had an amazing view of their beautiful courtyard (Pool, hot tub, fountain, patio w/ tables and chairs). Some rooms had balconies overlooking the courtyard, ours did not, but will next time! Great for a romantic getaway, honeymoon, wedding, girls night out! We went for our 12th anniversary. I'm planning on going back for our 13th!"
"Review_13536","hotel_177","hotel_2324","Jun 17, 2008","Great hotel, great city !! My wife and I spent 3 days at the Maison Depuy in New Orleans, LA. We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms, but it was still very nice. I am not sure I have ever been in a room as quiet as this one. Considering the lively surroundings I am amazed we heard practically nothing when the door was closed. Although the price was very affordable (approx. $100 on weeknights,) the hotel felt luxurious and the decor was impressive. The fountain and courtyard are a great place to smoke the evening's final cigar and reflect on the day's frivolity. We enjoyed our stay and will gladly stay there again on our next visit to NOLA."
"Review_13537","hotel_177","hotel_3035","Jun 16, 2008","Absolutely LOVED IT! I fell in love with this hotel the minute we walked into the lobby. I decided to surprise my husband and take him on a trip for Father's Day. We just got back last night and I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. The staff was WONDERFUL. They gave us great recommendations on where to eat and things to do. We had a king balcony room that overlooked the courtyard and the pool. I was out on the balcony every morning because it was so relaxing listening to the fountain. There were no weddings going on during our stay but even if there were it would not change my review. We did not come to New Orleans to hang out at the hotel pool so that would not have been a factor for us. It is 3 blocks (short blocks) from Bourbon street so you don't get any of the noise that you would get if you stayed at a hotel on Bourbon. We are going back to New Orleans in July of 2009 and we will definately be staying here again. The only drawback was the 28.00 a night parking but all of the hotels charge about that since street parking in nonexistent (overnight parking on the street is for residents only) and offiste parking is more expensive than the hotel parking so if you rent a car you just have to suck it up and deal with expensive parking fees no matter where you stay."
"Review_13538","hotel_177","hotel_2022","Jun 15, 2008","Beautiful hotel This hotel is at the edge of the French Quarter, but well within walking distance of everything. Our room had a private balcony that looked out over the courtyard. The room and bathroom was very clean and very comfortable and we loved the balcony. The pool is clean, beautifully landscaped and there is a great hot tub. The staff was nice--we had very little need for any staff services although friends that we travelled with requested a coffee maker and never got it. Complimentary coffee is available in the lobby beginning at 6:30 A.M., but our friends are very early risers, so available coffee is always a plus to them. My only criticism would be the closing of the pool area during weddings. We were there during the week and we left on Friday. A sign was posted in the lobby stating that the pool and spa would be closed beginning at 4:30 that afternoon until the next day. Had that sign been up when we checked in at 10:30 at night after being involved in a train wreck that day, I would not have taken very kindly to it. The pool and courtyard are divided by land-scaping and I would think it would be fairly easy to keep wedding events separated from regular guests. Also, you may request a courtyard room, but that does not mean that you will get one. We were very lucky. Restaurants we would recommend are Brennan's (of course!), Deanie's for fresh seafood at reasonable prices, Petunia's for breakfast, and Maison Bourbon for authentic New Orleans jazz. The French Quarter was basically untouched by Hurricane Katrina and I wondered if enough people were back to provide the kind of service we had on previous visits. The hotel had plenty of people on staff and all the restaurants gave the customary wonderful service. I would definitely stay at Maison Dupuy again. It is a great place."
"Review_13539","hotel_177","hotel_4382","Jun 9, 2008","Southern charmer We had our wedding at the Maison Dupuy on May 30. The pictures don't do it justice. It's a wonderful little hotel with great, attentive staff, especially Frank the concierge. I know alot of people complain about the fact that the courtyard is always being occupied with weddings. But that's hardly a reason to give the hotel a bad review. They host so many weddings because it's a great wedding venue. Our guests had a great time, and we're looking forward to spending our one year anniversary in the quarter."
"Review_13540","hotel_177","hotel_8810","Jun 9, 2008","Good decison to Stay at The Maison Dupuy Stayed at the Maison Dupuy on a Friday and Saturday night. All the amenities of a large hotel but still had a French Quarter feel as opposed to staying at a high-rise on Canal Street. No trouble with the check in. Room was large for the Quarter and was ready for us when we arrived at 2 PM. Had a king room overlooking Toulouse St. Courtyard view would be better but we were only paying $120 per night. Air conditioning worked great which is always important in NO in the summertime. Just a couple of blocks from Bourbon St so it was an easy walk yet far enough away you don't get the noise. It can be a long walk to Jackson Square area. Housekeeping was efficient. Hotel was very clean. Found the staff to be helpful and engaging. As others have noted, I think there were 3 weddings there over the 2 days we were there. They did take over the court yard but we were off looking for dive bars (try Fahy's across the street), so it was not a bother to us. Courtyard was nice for Sunday morning coffee, though. Elevators seemed a bit slow. Only item not exceptional was they did not slide my bill under the door so I had to go down to the front desk to checkout. I'm a discriminating traveller and I would have no problems whatso ever either recommending it or going back myself."

The first room we got had a really noisy A/C compressor. My husband called the reception and in about 5 minutes there was someone at our door with keys to a new room. He even helped us move our bags. Parking is pricey but is the rate for the area. And you do need parking option is you drive to New Orleans. The only thing I would not recommend is the breakfast buffet. Way to expensive. At the end, we had a great stay. I would recommend it and go back again."
"Review_13542","hotel_177","hotel_6607","Jun 1, 2008","Enjoyed, but Stayed 4 nights from May 16-20th. Check in went well, room was ready. We had a balcony room #317, had requested a courtyard though. Room was non smoking, very clean, but very small and laid out strangely. Our room overlooked Burgundy Street, not much to look at but we enjoyed the balcony, got lots of sun. First night (Friday) slept great, second night Saturday the noise from people yelling all about kept us awake off and on all night. There were at least 4 weddings held there between Friday and Saturday, this is my major complaint, the courtyard area is taken up with the wedding parties, not available for other guests. By 10:00pm the courtyard was available and we did enjoy taking a drink out there. Only had drinks in the bar twice, good service. Ate breakfast on the day we departed in the restaurant, could order from the menu, but choose the buffet because service was pretty slow. Front desk personnel were great in helping my daugher with incoming and outgoing faxes. Check out was fine, no problems. Housekeeping came very late on Saturday, but on Sunday were knocking on the door (even wtih the do not distrub sign out) at 8:30am. We felt the location was perfect for us, and even though our room was small, it was clean and doable. One of our best dinners was at the Bombay Club (at the Prince Conti Hotel) quiet, romantic with a great piano player. This was after 2 nights of dining with our large group. The swamp tour (Cajun Pride) was fun and entertaining, we also enjoyed the carriage ride through the french Quarter and the Charles Street Trolley. A great time, we are looking to returning next year! A couple side notes, we did try calling room service Tuesday morning, no answer, my daughter (in another room) requested an ironing board (iron was provided) several times with no result."
"Review_13543","hotel_177","hotel_1659","May 29, 2008","NOT a Good Experience!! We were very much looking forward to our romantic getaway but, unfortunately, a series of unfortunate experiences caused by your hotel, caused this weekend to be ruined.First, upon check-in we learned that the hotel pool/courtyard was going to be closed from 4:30PM on Saturday until Sunday morning because of a private event. While I appreciate the need for a wedding to be perfect, I was very upset to learn that the courtyard and pool (the reason we chose to stay at Maison Dupuy) would be closed for all that time. We had intended to spend Saturday evening lounging in your courtyard and enjoying it鈥檚 beauty. Because of your hotel鈥檚 decision to book a special event that closed the courtyard, this was not an option. When making our reservation, and again when confirming our stay, we were never notified that the courtyard would be closed.Once we checked in, we arrived at our room and I decided to go into the bathroom to take a shower to freshen up for the evening. As soon as I stepped in the bathroom, I stepped on a piece of glass that was on the floor and cut my foot. When I looked down I could see what looked like an entire wine glass that had been broken in the bathroom and not cleaned up by your housekeeping staff. While the cut was not serious, it did cause a lot of pain and prevented me from walking around and enjoying the French Quarter. In fact, we were not able to visit the Rodrigue exhibit at NOMA because I could not walk long distances. I immediately called housekeeping and my husband and I waited 45 minutes for them to arrive before finally leaving for dinner. Thankfully, the glass shards were cleaned up when we returned.When we left for the night, we went to turn off the bedside light and found that the on/off switch had been broken off and the only way to turn it on and off was by unplugging it. During our stay, I called the front desk three times requesting that it be fixed and it never was. Maintenance NEVER came to fix the broken lamp. By Saturday night, the cut on my foot was really hurting so we decided to stay in the room and watch television and relax for the evening. At about 6:00PM the special event鈥檚 reception started in the courtyard. The music was so loud in our room (room 418) that we could not even hear the television. We called downstairs and were told that it was a wedding reception and there was nothing they could do. This reception didn鈥檛 end until well after 10:30PM.On Sunday, we decided to leave as early as possible because we were exhausted by the horrible stay. We gave the parking our attendant our ticket and waited, and waited, and waited for our car. We asked a different parking attendant to find out what was taking so long because at least 5 other guests came after us and go their cars while we were waiting. Finally, after 45 minutes, our car arrived. The parking attendant told us that a church van was blocking us in. We were not offered any refund on our already expensive 48+ hours of parking that we paid for."

Way too small to handle both conferences and wedding events on the same day along with family outings.This used to be an exclusive New Orleans boutique hotelbut is now geared to lower end small company business conferences, cheap family getaway lets get drunk on Bourbon St crowd, and weddings anyday of the week which means: bottom line the facilities are not available 24/7 they are often closed such as the pool and courtyard. What was once a $400 night hotel for the business, elite traveler is now a $49-79night cheap 4 star; check any Experien or Yahoo or Priceline, this is the cheapest of all the original Dupuy owners would be very disappointed.

Rooms were updated and clean, staff was friendly and did what they could to accomidate my needs (which were very little since the hotel was excellent enough). 2 blocks from Bourbon Street, yet far enough away that you didn't have a problem getting to sleep because of the noise of staying someplace else on Bourbon Street.Had a King Deluxe room with a courtyard view. Very Nice. Would suggest trying for a Balcony room overlooking the courtyard for the full experience. (although it's really just an extra and not necessary)Be advised that parking is an extra $30ish a night.... but that is with all the hotels in the area. If arriving via NOIA, the cab ride from the airport to the hotel is $28 for 2 people, and extra $12pp after that. You really DO NOT need a car while staying in the Quarter or anyplace Downtown. You can get a day pass for the streetcars or buses... or pay $1.25 (0.25 for transfer) If renting a car for the day I would suggest using a place like Enterprise who will pick you up and drop you off before and after your rental.Pool area and courtyard was very nice. Did not eat @ Dominique's, but did eat @ the French Quarter Bistro. Very good food. I would stay here again, if not all the time I visit.For extra class and just to be pampered, request nightly turn down service. Very nice."

The balcony street room in Spring was full of the warm air and street noises of this charming old quarter area. If you do not want to hear police cars and garbage trucks stay inside. New bathrooms and decor. Great value for our webrate $103....scary at the posted room rate of over $400!!! But truly charming with its inner courtyard and attentive staff. Be aware that asking for a courtyard balcony does NOT mean you get one but in fact the street balcony in some ways offered more privacy and a very Parisian rooftop view. Good location on the outer edge of the Quarter, the usual expensive valet parking. Neat feature for clean-niks is the pull out clothes line above the bath. Nice free computer access. Iron and board but no coffee maker. Rooms adequate size but not too good for business use perhaps. But hey...who does business in Nawleans anyway?"

"Review_13554","hotel_177","hotel_2751","Feb 19, 2008","Stayed for Mardi Gras My husband and I were in New Orleans February 1-8, 2008 for Mardi Gras, which coincidently was my husband's 50th birthday. I wanted a nice hotel in the French Quarter, and was aware that that I would be paying top dollar during Mardi Gras. We paid $289 US a night for a King with a balcony overlooking the inner courtyard. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, and our room was very nice. However, that is where the positives end. We tipped housekeeping $4-$5 everyday. All we received was clean towels. I had put a paper coffee cup down on the bedsheet and left a small ring that remained there for 7 days. Obviously our linens were not changed. Our minibar did not work. I had done a lot of shopping and little bits of paper from my unwrappings remained on the floor for 7 days. I deep conditioned my hair, and rinsed it out in the sink. In the process I had splashed the mirror and tried to wipe it up with a face cloth but made a mess instead. You guessed it, the mirror stayed that way for our entire stay! A tour failed to pick us up, so I asked the front desk supervisor to call them for me, and it took her 20 minutes to find the number. She told us to go up to our room and she would contact them and then call us. A half hour passed so I went down to the front desk and got the number myself. I called from my room and it was a disconnected number. So I went back down to the front desk and said that I had been given a wrong number. I was given another number and it too was disconnected. The front desk made no offer to refund my phone charges of .75 each, even though they had given me two wrong numbers. We ate a number of times in the bistro, and service was either hit or miss, more of a miss. I had to ask that my coffee be filled up 3 times in one evening. I think that the housekeeping daily tip warranted more than my bed being made and towels being left. I know that Mardi Gras can be crazy, but when I experienced the lack of service from the front desk and the bistro there was only a couple of other guests around. I did not let the hotel ruin my Mardi Grad experience which was amazing. It simply is not worth the price that you pay!!!!"

The car parking staff, and that is what I am going to call them were rude has hell, they acted like when you had to get somehting out of your car, that it was too much for them for you to walk down and get it. The rooms were nasty as hell and weren't worth the money that we paid for them. On the last day there, my sister wedding they decided to park the cars down the road in the not so nice area where my father car had gotten broken into along with this other car without telling us about it. Just goes to show you pay all this money for them to park your car and keep it safe and they decide to park it somewhere else down so that it get broken into. I think that it was a inside job, and dont expect the local police department to give a crap about your car or the people that did it, I dont know why they have a police department there in the first place. All in all if you do decide to go to this so called hotel, then be warry that they might park your car down the road, and not pay up if your car gets broken into. I would never stay here again."

Main DuPuy really was a quite pretty, the beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was mostly clean, but that was it. The mini-fridge was missing and the safe was not working, and I was told by Sylvia at the front desk that the mini-fridge was out-of-order with no explanation or apology, and Dean came up to look at the safe but had no new batteries (his comment: I tell them I need these things but they never buy them), and he never returned.  There was a film of dust on the closet door, a non-working lightbulb in the bathroom, an assortment of trash on top of the armoire, and the blow-dryer was the worst I've used in any hotel. After calling about the mini-fridge and safe and getting no resolution I made no effort to complain about the other issues. It also took 20 minutes to have our car brought up when we left, and we watched the gentleman we gave our ticket to chat and wander around for ten minutes before he went to go get our car. We refused cleaning service while we were there, due to the non-working safe, and I'm thankful we did because on 1/7 we heard a gentleman on our floor hollering about items being stolen from his room.  I tend not to be a needy traveller, but for any hotel, and especially one at this price, I expect a certain level of cleanliness and attention to detail that were obviously lacking in this hotel room. Frankly, I've stayed at nicer $70 highway motels, and if there was another hotel available in the French Quarter I probably would've left after checking out our room."
"Review_13558","hotel_177","hotel_5805","Jan 1, 2008","New Orleans in December A decent hotel. Although for the price you get a nice room, and that is it. Parking will cost you a minimum of $24/day. If you want the restaurant's breakfast buffet it will cost you $15/plate. Dinner prices are also steep. But it should be noted that this hotel is in the French Quarter in New Orleans, which is not generally known for affordable accommodations. Our request for a quiet room placed us in one directly across from the elevator. I do not know if that was the only one available - but I tend to doubt it. More like it was the motel letting us know where we stood with them. Ours was one of approximately 40 rooms reserved for out of town guests there to attend a wedding. With most, if not all, rooms being rented for a minimum of three nights. We used out ear plugs and were able to ignore most of the night time noise.  During the winter months I would suggest that you forget the heated year-around swimming pool. Which proved too cold for my wife to do laps, although I managed about 30 minutes before the water temp (high 60s - low 70s f) caught up with me.  The location is very nice for the wedding /reception, but the site's wedding planner was only marginally competent. At least in this circumstance. Some of the more interesting snafus included:-- the wrong wedding cake (switched somehow with one for a wedding the following day),-- cameras on the tables noting the names of another couple (also for another wedding), and less than one-third of the cameras which were purchased,-- horse and carriage, paid for but did not appear,-- bride's flowers failed to make it,-- microphone on the podium not turned on - making it pretty much impossible to hear the service,-- a band, scheduled to start playing at 11:00pm, failed to show. And through all of this the bride and groom were running around tending to logistics -- which should have been the responsibility of the planner. (This is just a heads-up in case you're looking to use this location for a wedding and/or reception.)  The bride's family also paid for something called a 'Cajun Gift Basket' which was to be placed in the rooms of each of the out of town guests. And which none of us received.  Our motel experience was not by any means unacceptable, although I now wish we had stayed at one of the chain hotels - located several blocks away - at half the room rate we paid."

The truth is that there was no shampoo the night we arrived, I asked for some but they were out!!!, the body lotion was used, the TV control was out of batteries, the next day no one cleaned our room or changed sheets and towels and after staying there for 2 days of course no one thought of apologizing or at least replacing the shampoo. I was there for a conference and thank God I was not paying for it, but If I had to pay $290/night from my own pocket I would have called the police, the fire dpt. or both. Not recommended."

It was located in a alley, we were both scared to death to get out of the car. Not only were we scared but there was so parking in front of the hotel to even unload our car. Once that was over we had to pay $30 dollars to have the car valet park offsite. Took 45 min to have someone find our car the next morning so that we could checkout. The room and bathroom were so small that two people could not walk around at the same time. The shower head was broken, the toilet ran constantly, and no water pressure even in the broken shower head. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. The pictures on the website look nothing like it when you actually pull up to this dump!"

The location is great. I have always stayed in the French Quarter or on St. Charles St. Both had good and bad points, this hotel has both. It is one block from the French Quarter and the casino, it's close enough but not that noisy. I love the elegance of St. Charles and the streetcar, and it still not too far away from the action. The exterior could use a makeover, however, when you enter the lobbly it is a different world. The furnishings are period with marble floors and nice paintings. The rooms were nice and clean with lovely drapes. The remodeling on the restrurant was noisy but no problem. Very nice employees. This certainly has old world charm Will recommend to everyone!"
"Review_13564","hotel_178","hotel_1862","May 27, 2008","Never again!!! I was VERY disappointed when my husband and I arrived at the hotel. We were celebrating our first honeymoon/vacation together! The pics on the website looked very nice and the room decor looked very clean and well set up. Where did they take those pictures? Although disappointed and almost in tears, my husband got me to agree to stay! The first room we checked into was room 103. OMG... the lamp wouldn't work and the safe was broken. The t.v. was too small to even watch and it was in the armoire' which was broken and would not close. The room was so small that you could barely turn around in. They offered to take off the charge of the safe or give us a different room. I wanted a different hotel, but settled for a different room(room 203) with double beds because I figured it had to be bigger. Indeed! The room had more space and for the most part was clean. The tub could've used some TLC! The safe WORKED! However, one lamp didn't so we had what felt like a candle on the wall for light the whole weekend. We didn't say anything because we didn't intend on spending much time there anyway. Some of the electrical outlets did not work. The safe was small but I didn't have alot to put in there! I donated to the Harrah's foundation while I was there! LOL... You are charged 4.95 for local/long distance calling, internet. The signal is TOO weak to use in your room so if you wanted to spend anytime online you must sit in the lobby. The phone in our room. DID NOT WORK.. By this time I was NOT surprised by anything!! I, however, never seen a bug in the place.I almost forgot...The ice machine didn't work either! I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE!!!! Our first time in New Orleans was a GREAT, AMAZING, EXCITING,(etc) feeling. NO THANKS TO THIS PLACE.The location of the hotel is the only thing it has going for it! HOWEVER.. there are several in the same area so get a room there!"
"Review_13565","hotel_178","hotel_2887","Apr 20, 2008","Decent value I booked this hotel through a website that specialized in New Orleans boutique hotels. Because we stayed for 3 days, we were able to get a deal ($62.50/nt before extras and tax). Parking was extra, but we self-parked and found some deals just a short walk away.PROS: location - 1 minute walk to Harrah's and Canal Street; 4 minutes to Bourbon Street; 10 minutes to Cafe du Monde. Value - most hotels in the area are much more expensive. Old hotel with lots of charm. Free wireless (though our room had a weak signal). The bed was ultra, ultra comfortable!CONS: the smell of SMOKE! The lobby, the room, everything had an old smoke smell. For this entire part of my trip I had a sinus infection. There was no breakfast, and parking through the hotel was very expensive. The bathroom light stopped working and the safe (mandatory fee) was too small to hold a laptop. Barely big enough to fit our Harrah's winnings! ;-)"

The only decent thing was Darlene, the front desk clerk. She was very helpful with all the problems we had. Very noisy, A/C wouldn't work half the time. The so called antique beds were just old and gross and the posts blocked the view of the tv. We had to turn the bed sideways to see, the 12 channels they offer. We called for our truck and waited an hour and a half. The next day they brought it to early and we got a ticket. Overall, the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Would only go by to say hi to Darlene, hopefully from outside. Don't stay here unless the streets are full!!"
"Review_13567","hotel_178","hotel_9282","Apr 7, 2008","Good Value and Location The Pelham is a boutique hotel with lots of charm. It's a unique experience and makes you feel closer to the New Orleans culture.Harrah's casino can be seen from the front door, Canal is one street over with shops and restaurants. Location is good, parking is up to you. I actually parked on the street at night for free at a meter. There is a lot across the street for $10 a day or you could pay the valet $28 for in and out privledged parking at the hotel. Bourbon and French Quarter are also close. It felt safe, lots of tourists in the business district. Good value hotel, I think I paid $65 off of expedia.com. All I can say is do your research and see if its for you. I would recommend the hotel as it was quiet at night and the beds were comfortable. The room has high ceilings and French decor. It was a nice change from the big franchaised hotels."
"Review_13568","hotel_178","hotel_10474","Apr 1, 2008","Overall a good hotel! I picked this hotel up for 77.00 a night for the last weekend in March.It takes a bit of navigational luck to drive to this hotel by car as all of the nearby streets are one way. I would definitely advise not parking in the surface lot across the street from the Pelham unless you will be leaving you car there and not moving it and like to wake up in the morning. You must pay your $10.00 a night into a box by 7am and if you arrive in the evening, you must pay $10.00 overnight and another 10 for the next day, ends up being a bit of a ripoff. The Harrah's Casino is literally a block away and the parking garage is 2 blocks (but connected underground to the casino as well). If you gamble for 30 minutes they will validate your parking and it is free, I did this for the remainder of our trip.Onto the hotel itself: The outside is nice but nothing spectacular, most of the buildings immediately around it are for sale and abandoned but this is by no means a bad part of the CBD to stay in. You can walk across the surface lot and be immediately on Canal St. or you can walk one block to the Harrah's Casino right off Canal as well. I'd advise only taking those 2 routes to the hotel though as most of the streets in the CBD are empty at night, but those two have high traffic all night long.The staff was relatively unfriendly but it did not bother me too much. They check you in/out and got me towels once, but did not seem particuarly interested at all. The room was actually pretty nice. Although the only light sources are the lamps and the windows. It is pretty dark inside the rooms even with the light on. But overall was comfortable and a nice place to stay. We stayed in 410 which has 2 double beds.This hotel does charge 2.95 for an in-room safe and 4.95 for wireless internet. I find these charges to be a bit ridiculous but since I got the room so cheap I didn't really mind, plus I used the wi-fi. I enjoyed my stay here. It is more convenient to Jackson Sq. and Cafe Du Monde, Decateur Street than a hotel I previously stayed on Conti St. above Bourbon.I'd recommend this hotel if you plan to visit Harrah's or need easy highway access on I-10 or 90. Overall it was a good stay and will stay here again if the price is right. Its certainly not a luxury hotel, nor does it have the charm of some of the FQ hotels, but it worked for us this time."
"Review_13569","hotel_178","hotel_6962","Mar 12, 2008","It's a New Orleans hotel... Now let me explain what that means. It means, there is no such thing as a value when dealing with hotels. You get what you pay for, and unless you drop a lot of cash, you're not getting a lot. Rooms will be small or seem that way since they're oddly shaped (unless you're staying somewhere on Canal or anywhere not the French Quarter). Hotels will have hidden fees. All hotels in New Orleans charge those weird phone and safe fees, even if you didn't use them. And you will pay a lot for parking, but you won't use your car the whole time you're there anywhere. So why not pay whatever they want to make sure your car is safe? And, the staff will be friendly. Now the Pelham is on the nicer end of a New Orleans hotel for what you pay. (You'll end up paying twice what you thought. See: hidden fees.) The room is a place to sleep and shower (both bed and bathroom were very nice). Big gorgeous windows, very clean, and nice housekeeping staff that won't just walk in when you don't answer in one knock! The convenience of the location, though, well it depends. For what we needed it was convenient. The hotel is a short walk from the casino and some shops and restaurants. The French Quarter is a little farther away, but FEELS much farther away in the heat."

We took a cab from logan to the hotel which took around 15mins. When we arrived we noticed the hotel was next to a bar, but we never heard any noise from the bar throughout the out week. Our room was nice, (nothing amazing) it was clean, comfy and had all what we needed. It had a TV which had loads of channels (although we hardley watched tv). The bathroom was small but really clean and everything worked. We had it cleaned daily with fresh towles. There was no tea and coffee in the room but there was a machine downstairs and you could have a bucket of ice in your room. The hotel was in a brill place, 5 min walk from back bay subway and if you get a good map you can walk to many attraction and malls. Lots of restaurants and starbucks and dunkin dougnuts around.

"Review_13575","hotel_179","hotel_8344","Sep 9, 2008","Mixed Bag This hotel while quirky and cool, with friendly and knowledgeable staff, and having a great location to explore downtown Boston neighborhoods (Back Bay, South End, Beacon Hill, Downtown, etc.), also has small rooms and bathrooms, is a little more expensive than we'd hoped for (certainly given the size of the room), and has a horrible air-conditioning system. Our air conditioner (located in room 508) was a tiny window unit that blew light cool air inconsistently, would freeze up if left on high, and would also leak water after time no matter the setting. We stayed there 3 nights while on our honeymoon, and getting up in the middle of the night to adjust the air conditioner is decidedly un-romantic. Still, if you're looking for great location for the price (most hotels in Boston exceed $200/night, and this one was about $160), and like the hominess of its staff, this is good hotel. I'd give it a grade of a C+/B-. (Note to the staff: UPGRADE YOUR FRIGGIN' AIR-CONDITIONING UNITS PLEASE!)."

Trust me when I say that the photos online are VERY deceiving. Our room was extremely small, dark, dirty, and scary. In addition, there was an odd, musty odor that made my stomach turn when we walked in. I didn't think it could get worse, but the teeny tiny bathroom was disgusting and the toilet paper roll left on the dispenser was an old roll with like 2 squares left on it!!! We wanted to check out immediately but there were no other hotels available for the weekend so we suffered through the first two nights. We asked for an upgrade if available and the staff was less than friendly and not helpful. On top of all this, the cleaning staff threw away some of our clothes in a bag we left in the room and we barely received an apology for it. The ONLY thing that was positive about this place is that when we thankfully had an opportunity to switch hotels, they did not charge us for the nights we didn't stay."

While there is a great little bar attached to the hotel the hotel itself was basically a 1 star at best. I have honestly stayed at nicer hostels with a bit better upkeep. My room smelled of old cigarettes and overall needed to be aired out for a few days. The bed had a rubber sheet over the mattress that squeaked every time you turned over and the bathroom was quite tiny, to the point of being uncomfortable.

"Review_13578","hotel_179","hotel_7352","Aug 10, 2008","Total misrepresentation on website My husband and I searched for a hotel on Expedia for a 2 night stay in Boston and the Chandler Inn is located exactly where we wanted to be. Before booking on Expedia ($140 a night) I checked out the hotel's website and it looked like a completely different hotel. I assumed they went thru a renovation and that the photos on Expedia were old, so I went through with the reservation and requested a King bed. When we arrived, they had me sign in and on my reservation it was written in large letters EXPEDIA. The elevator up to our room was done in all grey and opened up into a dingy stairwell from which you then enter a long hall to your hotel room. When we got into our room, Room 404, I was shocked by the size and look. It looked nothing like the rooms on the hotel's website. It was a creepy little room with stained carpet, very cheap furnishings, no luggage rack, no closet (just a tiny faux blonde wood laminated armoire), a polyester bedspread on a FULL-SIZE BED and a view of the office building directly across the street - out of one small window that was bolted shut and had an air conditioning unit that took up half the window. There was one outlet in the entire room and everything was plugged into it, so to charge a phone, we had to choose something to unplug. The light fixture in the ceiling gave off a depressing fluorescent hum and the bathroom was so tiny we couldn't put any of our toiletries in it, we had to keep them all on the only surface in the room - the small desk. The bathroom door had been painted so many times, that it didn't shut properly. We went downstairs and asked about another room as I had requested a King size bed, but was told they only had twins and queen-sized beds (ours was not a queen - but a Full...there is a significant difference). I suspected that they had Expedia rooms and that since we got a good price we were given this small, dingy room, but after reading other reviews, I guess they're all the same. I haven't stayed in such a depressing room since backpacking through Europe on a punishing budget. The only positive things were the location and the cleanliness of the room. One last note: it would be really nice if the older guys at the front desk were a little warmer; really, I mean, curt one-word answers don't cut it in customer service anymore. Just because people don't want to pay the truly outrageous hotel prices that seem to have become standard in the past few years, doesn't mean we deserve substandard customer service. Bottom line: I think we can all do much better than this hotel. At the very least, they should provide truthful representation on their website of the rooms they offer."

It has a stylish lobby, with very nice staff who take care of you immediately. In addition, the staff are very helpful and knowledgable about the neighborhood and giving directions. In the lobby there is a great coffee/tea/hot chocolate machine. Next to this machine there are stairs but don't fear there are also two elevators. The room I stayed in, the standard twin, was a no frills room. It had everything it was supposed to have (which is listed on the website). The bathroom wasn't exquisite, but it was simple, like the room. My room had a window overlooking the street (beautiful!!). Furthermore, it is difficult to find such a bargain in such an upscale city.The simplicity and plainess of the Chandler Inn surprised me, and I enjoyed it. However, this may also repulse you. So it's not that the Chandler Inn is bad it is clean, safe, comfy. It's just a matter of perspective and preference.*Note: When you leave the hotel, you have to return the key to the receptionist. It sounds silly, but if you ask why they will willingly tell you (it is a very sound reason)."

There are nice restaurants and conveniences (though not FRILLY enough to pamper those with 'champagne and caviar' tastes) that dot the area. We're a FIT couple anyway so the hotel's proximity to what Boston has to offer was appreciated. We also appreciate a great value, good service and cleanliness.

I find it hard to understand the negative reviews this hotel gets. Sure, its a budget hotel - but you know that when you book it. With the Marriotts of the world @ circa $300 per night you are not going to get the Ritz for $150 per night in Boston. Regardless of what people have paid that is the 'going' rate. Don't use the hotels own site use one of the others - the rates are better.Yes the rooms are small and the bathroom smaller. I understand the guy who said the rooms remind him of his college dorm - but they are entirely adequate. The location is great (5 minutes to Backbay station or 10 minutes to Boyleston) with cafes around the corner, a CVS across the road and pizza and other food within a few minutes walk. The neighbour pleasant and non threatening and the hotel is clean. I've always found the staff pleasant and helpful.There appear to be some refurbished rooms (last time I stayed on the 8th floor in one) but I prefer the non-refurb room I stayed in the 1st time and this time as it has a desk. The free wifi works well but not, I guess, in all rooms as I've seen a few people sitting in the corridor with their laptops. Lets face it you are not going to stay here if you are on a corporate expense account. But as a budget choice in Boston I don't see much not to like. I'm back in Boston for another conference in June and have already booked my room."

It was a $5 voucher at a local diner....the diner actually served great breakfast food...but it wasn't free....All in all, the Chandler Inn is adequate for a Boston stay...but totally dishonest about what it actually is providing travelers...that's reason enough for me not to stay there again."

"Review_13589","hotel_179","hotel_4674","Jan 17, 2008","reminds me of my college dorm room The hotel is located in the south part of Boston, somewhat close to the Prudential Center and other central Boston things. However, it is a rather character-less hotel, inside and out. My first reaction when I walked into the room was that it reminded me of my college dorm room - plain beige wallpapered walls, beige finishes, beige bedding - no character of any sort (aside from the one red plastic desk chair).The room was clean, the bathroom, albeit very small, was also clean. However, for $149 a night, I expected MUCH more.The problem really was in other areas:1) NOISY - at 7am, there were construction noises coming from above (5th floor) that continued until 9am! what's up with that?2) no heater... The thermostat was set at 65 degrees - which isn't that bad if you have nice blankets... However, the blankets were those really thin, cheap fuzzy poly things, that provided little warmth on a snowy winter day in Boston.3) no one at the front desk - I called the front desk twice after 11pm, and no one answered.4) we asked for a queen bed. However, the bed was a full and not a queen.Another annoyance, though minor, is the TV control. A lot of the Direct TV channels were unavailable, and so you had to surf through each individual channel to find what was available. There were literally hundreds of empty channels - and the printed channel guide was incomplete (for example, Comedy Central was on 230-something but was not listed on the printed channel guide)."

We checked in yesterday, and were on the bed watching a movie when my companion noticed a small black bug crawling across our restaurant guide. She squished it and it was filled with blood. I suspected bed bugs but didn't want to believe it, so I went online and sure enough, Harvard has a fact sheet on the web that described the bug to the tee (it was a juvenile,) including where to look and what signs to look for. We flipped up the mattress and the underside was crawling with adult bed bugs!!!! We were totally freaked out and pissed off. We went down to the desk, where they were nice and apologetic, and got a full refund. Small comfort considering we were exhausted and now looking for a hotel at 12:30 am. The worst part, however, was that the desk clerk told us this had been a problem before and they had sprayed but I guess it didn't work. This hotel is clearly shady and please don't expose yourself to that kind of health risk-- we now have to disinfect our luggage and all of our stuff, what a pain. But better than the alternative-- bringing them home!!!"

I entered the very small room, walked into the restroom and was greeted by a small beetle looking bug on the floor. I thought, no worries, just a beetle. After a long day, it was time for bed. The sheets weren't the crispiest I'd ever seen, but this is a two-star hotel. When I woke up, I saw another beetle crawling across my pillow. I contacted the front desk and informed them about the beetles. Throughout the day, I began itching. I noticed red bumps all over my body, I thought, Oh my God! They have bed bugs!! I complained and the management switched me to another room, which I learned (the hard way) had bed bugs as well. The bed bugs were one of the many problems at this hotel. The hotel is in desparate need of renovation. The bathroom tub was extremely grimy. This place needs need serious attention. It has potential, but it is poorly operated."

One month before going to Boston, it was hard to find an affordable hotel room so I booked a room in the Milner Hotel, being the cheapest one, without paying too much attention to the negative reviews it received. I鈥檓 a low budget traveller and usually choose the cheapest I can find at the best location (which doesn鈥檛 always mean it鈥檚 cheap). I鈥檝e never had such a bad experience as in the Milner Hotel. I do not mind a small room and even the fact that there鈥檚 no door between the room and bathroom doesn鈥檛 bother me. There was always a lot of noise at night. I was sleeping on the 5th floor near the back alley, where a dump truck collected trash every night + at some times people were talking and even yelling. The room clearly wasn鈥檛 isolated well enough. The second and worst problem was the cleanness. After one night I had several flea bites on my arms and legs (+ it got worse the other 4 nights :-(((. I asked the housekeeper to change the sheets (although I wonder if that would鈥檝e helped, probably those fleas were in the dirty carpet) but they never did. They never sent anyone to reset the phone either (the voice mail settings on the phone had been changed, I never got any of the messages that my friend left me). I wonder if I can report this flea problem to a healthcare service in the US? Apart from that I had a few minor problems: curtains falling down when trying to close them (I had to 鈥榟ang鈥?them up again several times), the lamp on the nightstand which didn鈥檛 work at all, and hardly any warm water in the shower (best I could get was lukewarm). I reported this when checking out but I doubt they fixed it by now as they never seemed to care about the flea and voice mail problem either. Taking everything in mind, this room definitely isn鈥檛 worth a $129 per night!"

I decided to go there as it was central and cheap. Mathew and Jackie (cute) were cool at the front desk, chatty and helpful. I was a random English guy on my own, there to see the sights, so for me the hotel was fine. Yes the rooms are small, I was in 413, on the fire exit staircase (nice), and when 'Pearl's' club spilled out onto the streets you knew about it, and yet overall, the place was fine.I didn't do breakfast in the 'Nook', looked small, and to be honest breakfast in one of the many diner's in the city is much more fun.Give it a try if you just want a place to dump your stuff and get on with seeing a great city day and night.

When I'm travelling on business, I want clean, quiet, inexpensive, well located. I don;t want or need the luxury amenities. I'm not in my room enough to make those worth the price. I read the other reviews for Milner, and I suspect most of the negatives were from people with expectations of luxury. Nope. You wont get that. It's a bit dated, but the paint is relatively recent. Lighting could be improved to make the corridors more pleasant. Front desk staff was competent. (although one traveller did have issues with the newbie behind the front desk. Ultimately the manager took care of the problem). Morning breakfast was reasonable. Internet connection spotty. Room was TINY. I was travelling single, and I got single: a twin bed in a small room. But the room was quiet and clean. I booked for one night via a web site. Then, my business plans changed, so I called the hotel directly, got rebooked for another night, at $50 less than the web site! It's in a great location in the theatre/downtown district, near everything one needs. I'll go back. Not a place for the fantastic honeymoon or partiers. But fine if all you want is a clean, quiet, acceptable place to sleep."

(onference was at the Sheraton hotel, and all their rooms were booked out). The Milner鈥檚 description and photos made it SOUND OK - and it was convenient enough...BUT.....in reality it is a FILTHY HOVEL. I feel I should report to Health department. IT IS A DISGUSTING PLACE and NOBODY there seems to care about it 鈥?except the handyman !For 'quaint' read 'falling apart'. Service is apathetic at the best of times although there was one young guy who was helpful. My room described as double room with desk and private bathroom was small, shabby, run down and dirty. The curtains were crappy and didn't meet in the middle so I was potentially overlooked (in bed) from across the road when the light was on. The shower tray was cracked and held together by tape; there was no door between the toilet and bedroom, and the washbasin was in a separate corner of the room. There was a huge stained area of ceiling tiles in the washbasin corner from an old water leak. No wardrobe but a hanging space with rail and 3 plastic hangers in the room. Nowhere to store luggage. The only good point was free internet access.The handyman told me that the hotel is half refurbished (5th floor is apparently more modern, avoid 3rd for sure!!) and the whole place NEEDS repair and refurbishment but management is not listening to what needs doing.Next morning I requested a change of room, and was put in the suite on level 6 (lift stops at level 5) so a walk up with luggage to the ATTIC. This was bigger with a small desk - window blinds have not been cleaned this century I reckon and the room reeked of stale tobacco smoke. The carpet was dirty too, not sure when it would have last been vacuumed, and the toilet needs attention -water dripped into the bowl continuously between flushes. Anyway I stuck it out 鈥?it鈥檚 a noisy place because the lift shaft is next to it so I got vibrations through the pillow at times..... (apparently this is the manager's suite when he is there so now I know his standards I can understand why this place is so run down....)Went to 'breakfast' once 鈥?a tiny little dirty area off the main foyer - floor filthy and sticky, nobody to assist, tables dirty, make your own waffles or find cereal, few yogurts and unappetising hard boiled eggs sitting in a bowl on ice.... make your own tea or coffee, use plastic cutlery (obviously recycled and stacked in containers unwrapped), muffins, doughnuts and bread in their plastic wrappers to help yourself to..... felt sick at the sight of it so didn't go back. TV was playing all the time, some inane rubbishy show.Thank goodness I was able to transfer out of this dreadful filthy place for my last night and stay at the Sheraton in deluxe comfort for not much more than the Milner charged.Milner should be knocked down; it is overpriced, filthy and unpleasant. If you want cheap accommodation try camping or a Youth hostel, definitely don't come here; if you want value for money then this place is a RIP-OFF"

Main reasons for choosing this hotel were price, location and availability. Was running in Boston marathon.Was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews on this website before travelling, but it was not that bad.Hotel is more like a BB/guest house with 24hr reception.Room had an AC/heater unit in window - this had to be kept on overnight as it was cold and wet when I stayed in Boston. Noise of unit may annoy some people, but when its keeping you warm you don't care!Room was small, there was no door separating the toilet/shower from the bedroom.Bed was against wall with window that did not shut flush, so had to stuff a pillow against window to keep cold out.Light switches looked ancient, took a while to get light a over bed on/off. Started off pulling socked in and out!Room was quiet, only noise was from traffic during night.Breakfast was eat as much as you want (or is that can).Cereal, bagels, make your own waffles, english muffins.Cereals in single serving boxes, so had to take more that one.Breakfast served in 2 quite small rooms, if hotel busy you may struggle to get a seat and just end up carrying it up to your room.Lift was out of order until morning I checked out, was on 1st floor so this didn't bother me."
"Review_13603","hotel_181","hotel_9851","Dec 30, 2008","Impressive Hotel Having stayed at many different hotels in Boston, including Hilton, Sheraton and Hyatt, I can honestly say that the Radisson holds it own against all of them. The rooms are crisp and clean. Bathrooms are a good size and completely remodeled and look great. The room carpeting and wallpaper are all new and clean. Outside hallways are spotless and elevators are fast. The hotel has installed Sleep Number beds which can take a bit of getting used to and you will either like them or dislike them. If you book your room on the east end of the hotel you will have the best city view of any hotel in Boston. Also make sure you don鈥檛 get a room that鈥檚 adjoining to another room. We were at first put in one of those rooms and all was fine until the 鈥渘eighbors鈥?moved in. They were extremely loud people and we could hear every word coming from the door including their arguments and dinner reservations, etc. They became so annoying that I went to the front desk and asked to be moved. I was promptly moved to a room that didn鈥檛 have the adjoining door and it was very quiet and well insulated. The best thing the hotel has going for it is it鈥檚 staff. All are very friendly and respond quickly to any issue. From Pre-arrival emails to switching rooms to my departure I was very impressed with the staff. They are currently remodeling their pool and work out area as both are closed for a few months. When this is complete, this hotel will be even better. We booked a bed, breakfast and parking package at a great rate. I highly recommend this as many hotels are charging $40 a night to park now. The breakfast buffet was good at the Theater Caf茅 with very friendly staff. It was great way to fill up before walking the city. All in all, this hotel is a great value for your money."

Although the Radisson is not the most high end hotel in Boston it really is a great value. I did a lot of research for hotels in Boston prior to selecting the Radisson and it was the most economical for what you get. Rooms were clean, check in was friendly  professional and the location is VERY good. We were able to walk to Newbury Street and the Prudential Center with relative ease. There are also some good restaurants very close to this hotel. I noticed that there were a lot of other girlfriend getaway groups staying and even a bunch of guy friend getaway groups too. The only complaint I have is with breakfast, which we only had on Saturday morning. If you order off of the menu be prepared to wait an inordinate amount of time for a simple meal. I'd suggest getting the buffet instead.... it's a much better meal and deal anyway."

Our room was BEAUTIFULLY clean everyday. Really exceptionally clean I would say. I was on a high floor with a great view of the city. Personally the balcony was a little scarey for me but that's my problem. Because I was attending a conference in a different hotel, I didn't have much contact with the staff but what I did have was friendly. The location was super!! good restaurants of a variety of cuisines all in the immediate area. Right in the theatre district. Just a couple blocks to Boston Common. A leisurely stroll to the Quincy market area (maybe 20 minutes very relaxed pace). I grabbed a sandwich from the cafe. It was fine. Also had the breakfast buffet one morning. It was good but not spectacular. I would have liked it a lot better had it been included (apparently they have a bed and breakfast deal I missed) rather than full price ( I think it was like $17). And I paid way less for my room than what I see here as average room price. I'll definitely stay here next time."

We were impressed with the Sleep Number beds, the amount of room we had, and the cleanliness...a nice surprise. A great find in the heart of the Theatre District of Boston - within walking distance to everything. Only glitch: my husband misheard the woman at check-in advise him of our free breakfast.....we went to the cafe inside the hotel that she'd suggested, had a light meal from their buffet, and were presented with a check for over $70!! We asked at the front desk about having that discounted, since we weren't expecting that expense and since it was SOO high, but since we'd gotten a great deal on our rooms, they weren't able to reduce the charges.

I stayed for business and the conference I attended was on the 6th floor of the hotel so that is the main reason I chose this property. I stayed 9/16 to 9/18 at a rate of $239 plus taxes which was the conference block rate. I was very pleased with the room. It was average size on the 20th floor with a great view. The beds were comfortable (sleep number adjustable beds) and the furnishing were relatively modern. The bathroom looked nice although not that big. They leave a USA Today paper outside your door each morning. My main complaints with the room was no mini fridge and no soap dish/shelf in the shower so you had to bend down to grab your soap and shampoo. The outside of the hotel is not glamorous, nor is the lobby but that really didn't concern me. The pool was average size and they had a decent fitness center with a couple of treadmills and a couple of cross trainers both with personal color tvs. There are no weight machines and no free weights with the exception of a few dumbbells. The main thing that is great about this hotel is the location. You are right in the middle of the theater district and 2 blocks from Chinatown. Fanheuil Hall is about a 15 minute walk. Boston Common is a five minute walk and the closest T stop is the Boylston stop which is also 5 minutes from the hotel. One block away across the street is City Place which has a food court which includes Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks and Cold Stone along with some chain restaurants like PF Changs and Rock Bottom. Legal Seafoods is across the street (great seafood!!!) and McCormick and Schmicks is a block away which has great happy hour FOOD specials (be warned the alcohol is grossly overpriced - $5.25 for a Coors Light draft)Would stay here again in the future for pleasure if could get a better rate.

UK and other non-US visitors beware of prices: those quoted are without taxes (it tells you this) but the taxes are: State 5.7%, City 4%, CCF 2.75%, so you need to add 12.45% to the stated room price and allow for the normal US tipping expectations. If you want a hotel in the centre, without paying for luxuries you will not use (our usual choice), then this will meet your needs.The hotel is near enough for you to buy food from a market and then watch bats flying as you have an evening picnic on Boston Common just one block away.

This was a pretty good location, close to a Trolley Stop  not too far to walk to the Pru Center. We arrived a little early at 1:30pm but were able to check into our rooms. We were two couples  wanted to be in rooms on the same floor with a good view. The reception agent (not very friendly  almot rude) advised us that there was only one room availabe to meet that request. so we ended up on a lower floor. The room itself was fine - we enjoyed the Sleep Number beds - kept very clean. The maid, however, did not discard the water from the melted ice in the bucket for two days. Breakfast in the restuarant was OK except for the LONG wait for our food that we ordered off the menu vs. choosing the buffet. The Consierge was NOT helpful at all. I called down to the desk for help with a dinner reservation. He was obviously busy with other guests and asked if he could call me back in my room which he NEVER did. I ended up making the calls myself. Overall, Boston is a great place to visit. We had some great meals at Fleming's (steak house), Top of the Hub and Artu (Italian) in the North End. Even though we're Yankee fans, the tour of Fenway was good. Try to make plans ahead for the Duck Tour as it was sold out on the day we wanted to go."

"Review_13623","hotel_181","hotel_6345","Aug 19, 2008","COMFY but with Construction Views My Husband  I along with our 2 month old stayed at the Radisson for 4 nights Aug 8-11 2008. We flew in and arrived at 11 AM without reservations and were so surprised that we could not only have a room with a high floor (23rd) but that we could go ahead and check in and have our room at 11 AM. The lady who checked us in was very pleasant. The bellhop was very courteous and he even gave us lunch and dinner recommendations as he walked our luggage up for us. It was such a nice treat to be able to take a nap while our baby did right when we got there. The room was very nice and clean and large enough for the 3 of us. We got a king room on the 23rd floor, but were a bit dissapointed that our gorgeous view was of large construction of a high rise building directly in front of the hotel. They started early too, like at 7 am banging, although it was a distant sound. It was still a sound not all pleasant to the ears. The linens on the bed were very comfy with the down. The maids were very generous and gave us PLENTY of towels and washcloths. With a 2 month old, we needed them! The maids arrived promplty between 10 and 11 am and this worked out perfect for us as we were always leaving at that time. One thing that was a dissapointment was there IS NO FRIDGE OR MICROWAVE. Which I'm sure is a reason to drum up business in the hotel bar and restaraunt, but a bit of a shock as most hotels of this stature have them, their food should speak for itself right? We never ate at the restaraunt as it seemed a bit overpriced by the looks of the food. We usually always try out the hotel restaraunts but didn't want to this time for that reason. However Legal Seafood is directly across the street and also the California pizza kitchen and another mediteranian restaraunt across the breezeway that was to die for! The concierge should recieve a RAISE-- he was EXCELLENT he booked us everyday with something! We went to Cape Cod, booked Dinner reservations, Booked taxi's-- He tooked care of everything and really made us love our vacation! He also recommended his favorite lunch place--The Intermintent Tavern--GREAT!!!! They had awesome food-- not much of a place from the looks, but you must GO!! the food was lovely. THANK YOU!!One thing that was unnacceptable though was the business center--only had 2 computers--in which teenagers who had walked in off the street were using to play solitare  get on myspace. I had to print out our boarding passes on the morning of our flight and I had to get the concierge to help me with it. That was VERY nice of him. I think the business center should be monitered by room key if you ask me!For the Money this was an awesome place to stay, but next time well make sure we have a fridge and microwave--as with a baby we sure would have had an easier stay, especially storing milk."

An attentive, friendly and professional staff greet you in the welcoming lobby. We were taken to our room which was big,spotlessly clean and furnished as advertised with a Sleep Number Bed. OMG! Just the bed was reason enough to love this place! We had our own private balcony with a gorgeous view of central Boston.There are tons of restaurants in the area, access to public transportation, Boston Common and Boston Public Garden are only 2 blocks away. If you need directions or trolley tickets, it is all available at the front desk. Excellent value for your money if you don't count the insane price they charge you for parking. It is my only complaint. They should be ashamed of themselves charging 33 dollars a day to park your car! There are many public lots close by that charge much less so be forewarned."

"Review_13626","hotel_181","hotel_4366","Aug 5, 2008","Great Location, Loved the Hotel Our family stayed in this hotel from July 28-August 3, 2008. We picked this hotel because they let you reserve a room on their website with 5 people in a room, because of the reasonable price and because of the great location, in the theater district, near the parks and subway. We had 2 adults and 3 children, one of them in a crib. I checked the hotel rates a week before we left at the Radisson website and got an even cheaper rate with no cancellation penalty. We paid an average of just under $200 a night.The room was average size with a balcony, we had room 2007 on the 20th floor, with a wonderful view of the Back Bay skyline and the John Hancock building. The room was very quiet when the balcony sliding door was closed. The bathrooms were pristine and clean, looked like brand new tile and fixtures, the shower was the rainfall type shower head, wonderful.The bellmen and concierge were helpful with everything from finding a drugstore and a cab to finding a screwdriver so we could change batteries in a toy. Our toilet had a problem one day and a building engineer was in our room within 5 minutes and had it fixed in 10 minutes.The other reviews were accurate in describing the nearby food court and 7-11 convenience store, both in the adjacent block. We were only a few blocks from China Town as well. I recommend Legal Seafood across the street as well as Finale, an outstanding dessert restaurant in the Boston Park Plaza Hotel building 2 blocks away. Also in the nearby City Place food court is the Gray Line office, from which we booked BeanTown Trolley Tours and a Gray Line All-day Cape Cod Tour. The Radisson is a stop on the BeanTown Trolley, as is City Place, another convenience."
"Review_13627","hotel_181","hotel_8122","Aug 5, 2008","Nice Overnight Stay I arrived at noon for a one night stay at the Radisson. I was pleasantly surprised to find they had a room available. Check-in was quick and cordial. I got to my room on the 9th floor and found it as it should be- clean, up-to-date and comfortable. The view was of the indoor pool and treadmills in the fitness center on the floor below. The bathroom was large enough, with the sink inside the bathroom, however, there was only an inch between the door and the toilet. I found that odd, since the bathroom was large enough- it's the placement that was off. The bed was comfortable. The room was spacious. There were two easy chairs and a table, in addition to the desk, two beds, and chest with a TV. There was a coffee pot with coffee, but no refrigerator or mini bar.I locked myself out of the room and handbag in. Security came immediately and let me in, then checked my ID to make sure I wasn't going into someone else's room. He was serious about the id, looking at it carefully. In the morning the elevators were terribly slow. Management needs to put in a service elevator as clearly a major part of the problem was room service and housekeeping taking up a huge amount of space in the elevators. Going down, then back up, there were two waiters with large trays, one person with an enormous laundry cart, and one woman in a Radisson desk uniform pushing past others to get on the crowded elevators. Shouldn't happen. The morning elevators were my only complaint about the hotel. I had to wait with a dozen or more people for more than five minutes for an elevator.The hotel is located across the street from a small food court that included a California Pizza Kitchen, a Dunkin Donuts, as well as about 10 other restaurants/fast food places. The hotel had a restaurant, but I did not use it. Their menu prices were quite reasonable for Boston.  It was a 7 minute walk to Boylston T station."

As stated the outside of the hotel really lets it down because the hotel is excellent.Our room 1701 had a living area, two televisions, two balconies and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on (stayed at Hiltons and Burj). The staff are some of the friendliest and welcoming staff I've encountered. The Gym is small but adequate and I enjoyed a lovely swim in the pool. They also have a terrace to sunbathe on if you so wish.The bar is very good for a quick drink before you hit the bars and superb restaurants in Boston (Legal Seafoods across the road serves the best dressed lobster in the world).All in all a wonderful stay in a wonderful city."

"Review_13630","hotel_181","hotel_9720","Jul 14, 2008","Average Hotel We stayed 3 nights at the Radisson Hotel Boston on Stewart Street. It was an average hotel. Not a lot of frills. It was a short, 4-5 block walk to the closest green T line, which made getting around the city convenient. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and average size. Two adults and 2 children had lots of room. It did not have a refrigerator, which was a disappointment. The pool was cool, but the kids enjoyed it anyway. There was no spa for them to warm up. They had a small exercise room, next to the pool. Radisson states they are a green enviornment friendly hotel, but the housekeeping staff did not seem to understand what that means. I tried to use our towels for 3 nights, but every evening there were fresh towels for us to use, despite following their instructions to reuse them.Overall I would stay there again if we were traveling to Boston. The hotel was convenient, staff were helpful and the room rates were reasonable, compared to other downtown hotels."

The room was huge with a separate lounge area with a 2nd huge TV. The bathroom was very modern with all the trappings you would expect from a four star.Bed was extremly comfortable and the views of down-town Boston from both balconies was really amazing !!I cannot fault this hotel on anything...we did not eat here so cannot comment on the food...location was excellent and all staff extremly helpful.When we visit Boston again we will return to the Radisson."

The free internet access is a great asset and the friendly staff is most certainly even more so. I had some disagreement concerning room billing and the personnel was most forthcoming. Two things bothered me: the hotel atmosphere is the culmination of anonymity. Lobby practically nonexistent and you felt sort of out of place even sitting down waiting for a colleague. .. I would have enjoyed a drink/piano bar.. . Furthermore the outside of the buliding resembles the lobby atmosphere.... more like a multiple story parking house with elevators carrying the cars to the different floors with not a living soul around..... :-).It is well situated in the downtown area.... I had a balcony overlooking beautiful Boston from the 21st floor but the balcony is in no way a place to put an armchair and enjoy the view .Nevertheless: to cut a long story short: go for it."

We were going to a Red Sox game and decided to book something in Boston for the night through Priceline. We got a great rate of $89.00 on priceline and were so lucky because with the NBA finals in town there were no hotel rooms to be found. Our room was on the 18th floor and had a nice view. I thought the rooms were great. They were pretty large compared to some of the rooms in the city, and it was very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the location was perfect.

We paid $125 a night instead of the $300+ standard rate. Hotel doesn't look that impressive from the outside but is newly renovated on the inside. Right from check-in the staff couldn't have been nicer and were extremely professional and courteous. Shout out to John H. the daytime concierge, he was extremely nice and helped us with the trolly tour. The rooms were very nice. We were on the 16th floor and had no issues with noise from the street. There is a bit of construction going on next door, but we had no issues with it and actually enjoyed watching the crane at work!The room had 2 queen size sleep number beds - they were quite comfortable and the kids had fun pressing the buttons and making the mattress go up and down! The bathroom was very bright and modern and extremely clean. The rest of the hotel was very clean also.The kids had fun in the pool, however, not the most impressive pool I've every seen and I decided not to take a dip myself. Could use some work. Nice sun deck attached though.The location of the hotel is great. Only 1 block or so to the T and Boston Common.

Starbucks, CPK and Legal Seafood is right across the street. My only complaint is the pool. The water was cloudy, the tiles around the edge were filthy and paint was peeling off in places.

The rooms were newly renovated, clean and comfortable. When making my reservation I opted for the $15 daily breakfast coupon (by paying $10 extra a night)...that was a mistake...when we visited the hotel cafe we found the breakfast prices to be VERY high...$16 for the breakfast buffet...and about $10 for every entree...so breakfast for a family of 5 would have been big bucks...so much for the $5 savings with the breakfast coupon. When I attempted to return the coupons and insist on a refund of the $10 a day, the front desk gave me a very hard time...after a bit of an argument, they issued the begrudgingly refund...call it a coincidence, but that night we received a surprise 3:30am wake up call....clearly a little revenge from the front desk staff....we promptly unplugged all our phones as to avoid any further mistakes by our pals at the front desk!!!

The location of the hotel is ideal and is walking distance to everything i.e Boston Commons, Faniuel Hall, Back Bay Shopping, etc. The hotel itself was as impressive as its location. The rooms were a good size and the king size sleep number bed was very comfortable. The staff were also very helpful. We arrived very early (9 am) and were provided with our room. Initlally our room was situated next to the elevator and was a little too noisey for me. The front desk staff provided me with another key to a room to see if it was more to my liking. It was! Great view, great layout, great bathroom. Also, John, the concierge, was without a doubt the best in the business. Very helpful!We're heading to Boston again in May/08 but unfortunatley the rate for the hotel was too expensive for us. We paid $209/night back in Sept.

We had two rooms;one overlooked the building site and downtown to a shabbier part of the city, the other had better views of the city although there was a lot of street noise on Saturday night. Good points: the rooms are immaculate and the bathrooms are spotlessly clean; the staff are efficient ( if not particularly friendly); Starbucks ( for breakfast) and Legal Seafoods (the best seafood restaurant I've been to) are across the road; easy access to the main attractions of the city. Bad points: HATED the beds.They seemed like glorified air-beds where you adjust the firmness by inflating or deflating- I woke with a sore back each morning; too much corridor noise from inconsiderate guests,this was every night including 3.30am on Sunday morning. However, we enjoyed the city very much and everything we wanted to do was walkable but I would not choose this hotel again."

Staff was very helpful, rooms had a bit more space and even if our bathroom was a bit cramped it was fine. I know other rooms had bigger bathrooms but it was not a big deal to us. I am a little unsure of the location, it is close to nice shopping streets but if you turn right toward China town there seemed to be an awful lot of homeless people and drunks. I turned around pretty quick. We had room service and the food was very nice tho expensive but that is to be expected. I also bought a bottle of wine, regular price from a store $5, for $25 and thought even for room service that was way too much. But I cant fault the hotel for that really, that was up to me.

I should have known charming was a euphemism for dorm room.So for the same price as this charming hotel - about $150, we switched to the Radisson. Not only is the Radisson in a MUCH better area (close to Chinatown for late night eating), walkable to the Commons, walkable to the Pru, and also in the middle of the theatre district.The hotel lobby is .... well pretty non-descript. typical 3.5 star corporate hotel lobby. The hotel's exterior is very concrete and not the most interesting. However, the rooms are FANTASTIC. We had a room on the 21st floor and we had the MOST amazing views of Boston skyline. We had two queen beds, a small sitting area and a very nice sized bathroom. For the same price, this was SUCH a HUGE step up from the charming inn.Internet connectivity is free and via an ethernet plug in the room - there is no wifi. Not a problem, just a note.The hotel also has a heated indoor pool and a small work out area next to the pool. The hotel staff is okay - not exactly the most friendly nor the most helpful, but it was fine."
"Review_13662","hotel_181","hotel_6522","Jan 20, 2008","Hurrah! The price of a deluxe king room was cheaper than a double in another nearby hotel, so we decided to forgo the independently-owned hotel experience for a chain. I am very impressed! We had an issue with our heater in the first room we stayed (started to smell quite like a fire and emit a little puff of smoke!) and we were politely and quickly moved to another identical room on the 22nd floor. The sheets and towels were luxurious in comparison to other hotels I've stayed at-- and excepting in Manhattan, we usually stay in 3 star hotels. The Sleep Number gimmick didn't factor into our comfort though it was a novelty to be toyed with.Breakfast in the Theatre Cafe was good, hearty eggs  bread type stuff. Great coffee. I suggest getting the Breakfast Package when you book your room, it would have been a better deal for us if we had.Parking: Free, free, free-- but you must denote this on your reservation, I think.Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpfu-- this was consistent with every staff member. The man who saw to our heater incident was especially kind and I appreciate that.Noise level: Could hear a bit through walls. At 2am there was a major commotion in the street below: Car horns, sirens, shouting-- sounded like something serious. I could hear everything. I wasn't bothered by it because I was comfortable and sleepy. Hiking the nearby Freedom Trail from end to end made me tired!Did not use pool though it looked lovely.I may seek Radisson Hotels in other cities, but when in Boston, I will stay here."

Didn't fancy paddling across the bedroom so opted for a lower level.Nice bedrooms. Pool was adequate but in need of a refurb, elsewhere the facilities were excellent. Had breakfast and Christmas dinner in the restaurant which were both fine.Location of the hotel is superb. Lots of choices when it comes to dining, from the nearby food court for fast food through to exclusive restaurants plus china town just down the road. The common and start of fredom trail are are very short walk away and the Beacon Hill area is close too.A couple of tips: If you look 35 (no exaggeration) or under and want a drink - take your passport. The drinking laws here are oppressive. The ONLY ID the bars/shops/restaurants/hotels will accept is a local drivers licence, US forces ID or passport. You can't even select a bottle of spirits in the liquor store, it's kept in a roped off area for staff only.If using the metro, known locally as the T, get a 'Charlie' card from the concierge and save 15% on this excellent service.If staying over Christmas be aware that unlike many parts of the US we have visited much of Boston closes down from mid day Christmas Eve until the 26th. Very few restaurants are open and only some corner stores. The T does still run though."

"Review_13665","hotel_181","hotel_9200","Jan 6, 2008","Decent Hotel Stayed at the Radisson with my fiance for two nights over New Years after a 3 night stay in th Hilton Financial District. We switched to the Radisson as we'd been given a special rate for a wedding we were attending in Boston at the Hilton, which was not valid for 30-31 Dec and the Radisson was approx. $50/night cheaper for those 2 nights.The hotel building is incredibly ugly from the outside, it's a high rise (20+ floors) grey concrete structure, built probably in the 1950's. The interior is fine though, however the lobby has an odd feel as it has 3 seperate outside entrances to it. Our room was on the 16th floor and was huge. On entering the room you walked down a narror corridor into a spacious sitting area with sofa, armchair, TV, desk etc and then on into the bedroom area. The bathroom however was tiny, definitely the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel. It had a toilet, sink and shower crammed in - when you got out of the shower you practically crashed into the sink! It was quite strange that in such a large room the bathroom was so inadequate and was definitely a bit off putting. The room itself was clean and we were given a couple of bottles of free water which was nice.The loction of the hotel was good, just off Boylston St and approx. 15 mins walk from the shops at Copley Place. We didn't really come into contact with any staff, so can't really comment on that.All in all the Radisson was fine. We'd been at the Hilton for 3 nights previously and much prefered that so the Radisson was probably a bit of a let down for us. However I think if we'd stayed in the Radisson for the whole of our trip iwe would have been perfectly happy with it!"
"Review_13666","hotel_181","hotel_2270","Jan 1, 2008","Bostons Best Bet!!! New Years Eve. Paid $168 per night. Stayed 2 nights. Hands down, this hotel is my favorite in Boston so far. The staff/ manager are very friendly. We arrived and were given the option of 2 rooms. A regular king, which we reserved and a jr. suite for the same price!!! Whoo hoo, that's a no brainer. So of course we took the 23rd floor jr. suite. Now, please be advised this room was next to the elevator and if paying very detailed close attention, this noise may bother you. But, as a teacher (we have a high tolerance of noise) and not spending a lit of time in the room itself, it did not bother us. It had a beautiful bathroom, spotless with an open glass shower, no bathtub. the living room extension had a tv cabinet with a small love seat and desk. This room comes with not 1, but 2 balconies. Score! In the bedroom area, it had a huge King bed, white heavenly linens, another tv! 2 night stands and drum roll.... a second balcony. Now, back to the noise... HINT- this side of the hotel (facing the Wang center) is a little noisy due to the construction that is going on. The other side of the hotel, facing the prudential building is a tad quieter, and the views, I think are better, but we were offered this suite and it was great! Had one drink at the Theatre Cafe that was frowned upon in the previous review. We did not have any issues with the staff, but the beer was a little flat. The pool is nice. The workout room is adequate, but Radisson should consider upgrading their equipment. This hotel is in the theatre district. Casual restaurants/bars to check out in walking distance are the Rock Bottom Brewery, Beantown Pub, Remingtons, Jacob Wirths, and the intimate Intermission Tavern. Walking distance to the Boston Commons/ Washingon St. and even Fanuiel Hall. The best part of this New Years Eve was watching the firework show at the Commons from our balconies!!! Again, Radisson Boston , best deal in town. Don't hesitate to ask to be upgraded. It doesn't hurt to ask. We didn't even ask, the manager just offered! We will be back at the end of Jan! ! ! Keep up the good work Radisson! Have a great trip!"

Check in was very efficient and the room was lovely, very large with the most comfortable beds ever. The hotel as stated is in a fantastic location and the Wrentham Village outlet is well worth a visit for bargain shopping ( the bus picks up outside). The hotel bar is a little pricey ( not helped by the current dollar rate) but is a nice place to relax after a busy day shopping. There is a number of restaurants close by. A cab from the airport to the hotel can be cheaper than the shuttles depending what time of the day you go. If it is not rush hour it is just under $30."

All toiletries apart from sampoo, conditioner and body lotion were not in the room. Even the robe was not there. For the price you pay, you do expect a little more.Cleaning was done at eratic times of the day, ie 3.30pm! The hotel is very busy with conferences and evening parties so there is alot of people around all the time. The lobby is like a train station with the people coming through. We felt that people staying at the Hilton accross the road, used the hotel as a short cut into the shops."
"Review_13673","hotel_182","hotel_4025","Nov 30, 2008","Barely Tolerable If it were possible to give one and a half stars, I'd rather give that-- the stay wasn't terrible but it wasn't okay either. It was tolerable, and that's about it.I stayed at the Sheraton in Back Bay from November 21-25 for a business conference. For a hotel whose primary purpose is to serve business travelers, I was horrified at the lack of complimentary services and the quality of those that that I was charged for. Wired internet was $9.95 per night and very unreliable-- on the third night of my stay, the automatic prompt for daily payment wouldn't load. After an hour with no luck, I called the front desk only to learn there is no helpdesk within the hotel and I was instead patched through to Sprint. After over 30 minutes on the phone with a rep, I finally had the internet service reactivated, but for me having to go through this hassle was completely unacceptable while away on a business trip. I had three small packages (8, 10, and 13 lbs) shipped to me at the hotel; on my bill at checkout, there was a business center charge for $53. I was told by the front desk that there's work involved when guests receive packages and that the hotel charges a fee based on the weights of packages. I always have packages shipped to me at hotel, and in my numerous, numerous stays at other hotels have NEVER been charged a fee to receive parcels. Again, this is unacceptable for a hotel that claims it's for business travelers.As for my room, I had a spectacular view from the 24th floor in the north tower, but that was really where the postives stopped. My single room (queen bed) was incredibly small. The desk was positioned at the foot of the bed and it was impossible to push the desk chair back all the way out from under the desk to get in and out because it hit the bed! There was barely any clearance between the chair and bed even when the chair was pushed all the way under the desk. The closet doors when opened blocked the bathroom door. TV channels were limited and four out of five nights the satellite signal went out repeatedly while I was watching. Valet parking is absurdly expensive at $41 per night.Overall, the room was liveable but certainly no where near comfortable. The location is great and can't be argued, but there are other hotels in the area (like the Hilton across the street) which may be better choices. I would not stay here again."

October 5 nights.Got the Sheraton on Priceline and went with a certain amount of trepidation having seen the variety of reports.What did we find?A wonderful hotel with wonderful staff, a wonderful breakfast, in a wonderful location. We loved it!We were warmly greeted by Will on reception with the words I've got a nice suite for you on the 16th floor North Tower overlooking the Charles River. Oh yes! - I'll believe it when I see it!.And see it we did, exactly as described. I've lived in flats smaller than the room. King size bed in alcove and large chest of drawers, desk and 3 piece suite with coffee table. Two windows taking up virtually all the exterior wall with a view down to the river and to the Fenway on the left. Nice size bathroom in good condition. Even a small room off the main room with a work surface to house just an ice bucket and the coffee machine.No safe but used the very effecient safety deposit box system in the lobby.Hotel linked to the Prudential Centre so plenty of shops and eating places. Also T stop without going outside.We ate from the buffet breakfast each morning which filled us up until the evening. Staff friendly and helpful especially Sophia.We adopted her!Location is great with trolley tour stop right outside.It could not have been better in anyway at all. Would stay again at the drop of a hat."

But if you've got more than one person in your room, you should look elsewhere. There were four of us in that tiny space, and it was hard on all of us. We kept hearing the elevators all night."
"Review_13677","hotel_182","hotel_8146","Oct 29, 2008","Nice lobby, but overall bad experience So there are a mixed bag of reviews for this hotel, I'll add mine based on a stay in Oct 2008. The hotel is connected to the Hynes Convention Center, you can't beat this for convenience. That's the single upside of this property. Now, for problems: old tube TV, turns out it didn't work at all. Maid went to the bathroom in my room, left soiled T.P in the wastebasket. Cost is quite high. Valet parking $46/nite. Wired internet in the rooms: $9.99, and it's slow.Carpets throughout the room areas, both inside the room I stayed in, and generally outside in the hallways were in need of replacement or at least significant cleaning. Room was dingy, old furniture, nicked and chipped up, Workspace for laptop work was stingy - no wrist supports, ethernet cable just barely stretched such that one can recline on the bed and compute. Room was quite small - reservation said king, but when I arrived it was a queen bed jammed in this little room. Bathroom reminded me of high school, same kind of industrial, bowl-less design. Couple more pluses, actually: staff was pretty decent overall, and whoever does their elevator planning deserves an A+ - in spite of being quite busy, never had to wait for more than 10-15 seconds for an elevator at the lobby level. Note I've been mostly staying in BB lately, so it had been a while since I've had to stay in a chain hotel. Never again - no more chain hotels, certainly Sheraton is pushed waaay down on the list now, Motel 6 for them."

Parking was expensive at $41./day, but the surrounding public lots were only a bit cheaper with no in/out priveleges and no valet service. We had a 7 yr old and a 5 mo. old baby, so we requested for an early check-in. We were told at the desk that the room was not ready. The front desk lady did not seem interested in helping, and we were told to just wait. There were no changing tables in the lobby restrooms, so that was a challenge. We were disappointed because she wasn't really helpful and didn't offer any consolation or extra concern because we had a little one. I requested a room in the newly renovated wing, but was told there were none, bec. the hotel was full. We were put in a dark , small, old room in the 19th floor. The beds were ok, but the room was indeed tiny. Not advisable for a family with a baby.The bathroom was small, too. The crib and the fridge we requested arrived eventually.The doormen, and the bellhops were very nice and helpful.What really mattered a lot was the convenience of the hotel's proximity to the Hynes Conv.

I wasn't expecting the hotel to be that nice but we were very happy with the service and accomodations as well as the location. We had a king suite on the 15th floor with a nice view of the city and St Charles River. We could also see Fenway Park. I would recommend that you request a room on the 15th floor or higher and facing the St Charles river. The room was spacious. The decor was just okay as was the bathroom. Its probably time for an upgrade to the decor. We enjoyed the pool, jacuzzi and sauna which weren't crowded at all. We had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant. Both times we had the breakfast buffet, which is a little on the pricey side ($20) but a better deal than ordering a la carte. Our waitress both times was Sophie who is the sweetest women who gave us bottled water for the road. Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful. The location, Copley Place/Back Bay is excellent. There are many restaurants (recommend Sel De La Terre and Atlantic Fish Co), bars and historical sites in walking distance. The trolley tour we took picked us up right outfront of the hotel. Also, its right next to the Prudential Center and near Copley Place. Really the location can't be beat!!"

So, i have to say Sheraton is the worst of all hotels, and it is not a 4 star at all, with staff like this.

He says your room does not have access to the CL, but we can give you it for an extra fee...I said I RESERVED the Club Level, he asked to see my confirmation, I whipped it out...AND HE HAD TO GO IN THE BACK TO CHECK WITH HIS SUPERVISORI felt like I was buying a car! well, Ma'am, I'll go ask my boss if we can swing this monthly payment...he comes back and tap tap tap on the computer and suddenly we were in a CL room that 10 minutes before had been not available.

The hotel feels as though it was designed by accountants. There is no attention to the comfort of those of us who stay here, rather the attention is on the photo-ops and the lobby. Lobby was lovely. Room was pretty bad. Bed was large, but the bedding was uncomfortable and scratchy and the pillows, though plentiful, were hard-as-a-rock horrors. The window didn't open though the view was ok. Curtains didn't close all the way. The bathroom was passable but no better than a cheap motel on the highway. Online access cost $$ and was by 1 ethernet cable - not wireless - so only one of us could go online at a time. Soda machines owned by Pepsi so a pathetic few overpriced choices of overly large pepsi products in hideous plastic bottles, no cans, no other brands. Complimentary USA Today which I really HATE. How about a Boston Globe, folks? Oh, and the decor in the hallways was flat out hideous. Hire a decorator with taste, Sheraton, how's that for a revolutionary idea? The price for this mediocrity was outrageous. Note to self: don't go to Sheratons, they rip you off."
"Review_13689","hotel_182","hotel_3316","Sep 16, 2008","Room allocation is critical it would seem Stayed here 3 nights in mid September whilst at a conference in the adjoining Hynes Convention Center. The hotel is convenient as it is part of the Prudential Center and thus its a very short inside walk to the convention center. As a result of this (and because of reading some of the reviews here on Trip Advisor regrading the food) we didn't use any of the hotel facilities as the Prudential Center has everything one needs.Room allocation appears to be key. This is borne out reading other reviews. My room was very small with an uncomfortably small bath room. The room suffered from significant plumbing noises. I couldn't decided whether this was something to do with the aircon or it was water rushing through pipes. Whatever there was an obtrusive rushing sound and then a 'bang' when it cut off. Given that the noise generally started about 4:00am ish and continued relentlessly throughout the remainder of the early morning I suspect it was the plumbing, or specifically, the flushing. On the plus side thee bed was very comfortable and everything in the room worked.The walls in this part of the hotel (North Tower - 20th floor) are thin and it was noisy. For example could hear next door flicking the light switches. Others have commented on this. So, judging on my experience alone, I'd not be impressed. However, my colleague down the hall had a much bigger room and none of the aforementioned issues! As a SPG member with a few points to my name I would have expected a better room - a feeling confirmed when it transpired that my colleague and I had inadvertently swapped rooms and I should have been in the bigger one without the plumbing noises. It does make me wonder however whether the 'noisy small' rooms are allocated to those paying the conference rate or whether it was just luck of the draw.Internet was $9.95 + $.50 'telephone tax' for 24 hours and worked fine. They also have free wifi in the lobby so if you just want to check email in the morning/evening you don't have to pay at all.For me the experience was adequate - my colleague would rate it higher. If I had the choice between this hotel and one of equal standard at the same rate I'd try the other."

I was checking in late, around 8pm and the guy in front of me was arguing with the front desk clerk over not having club access, this is apparently the special top floor of the hotel with included breakfast and snacks as I was to find out later. When I got to the desk I was expecting the worst but was greeted with a smile even after he was just chewed out. The clerk made great small talk and after tipping him a 20 we were upgraded to a beautiful suite on the Club level which had a fantastic view and included access to a continental breakfast and some snacks at night. Im from Las Vegas and I know how far tipping the front desk goes. They have a beautiful swimming pool with a retractable roof and friendly cleaning staff. Even the made who spoke very little english was genuinely friendly and was always smiling. Theres a ton of great shopping within walking distance and great restaurants as well, try Haru for excellent sushi! The concierge staff blew me away with their knowledge of the area and Jerry was more than kind enough to help with any reservations or suggestions. Dont be afraid to walk this city if the weather is nice, you are walking distance from everything and we found ourselves walking from one place to another just exploring the sites until we found ourselves on the other side of town! but if you end up too far away theres always the subway which goes right to the prudential center where the hotel is located. all in all a wonderful stay."

It is also right next door to a cheesecake factory which is just a lush dining experience. We stayed on the 25th floor and the views were spectacular. The beds were also really comfortable.

Browsed around there on some breaks from the conference. The Center has a beautiful courtyard you can go sit outside and read or eat. The Sheraton is within walking distance of restaurants, grocery stores, the T line, and other hotels. We took the T to all the touristy spots like Cheers and Havard. It's also minutes from the Charles River... so if you want to go for a walk on the paved paths, it's not far.The only thing that I didn't get is why the hotel doesn't have more signs on it so you can see it when exiting the T station. No shuttle services to the airport, either, which I also thought was strange."
"Review_13694","hotel_182","hotel_10587","Sep 10, 2008","Loved it!! Firstly a great hotel.The sheraton was in a perfect location for us, pretty central and pretty close to the airport. Upon arrival we were greated by an amazing lobby, with marble floors and great lighting. The staff were fantastic, very helpful and the checkin was a breeze. We stayed in a standard room, which was fantastic, the room had 2 double beds and was great. I love the colour scheme of the room, and the beds were great!The bathrooms were a different story, there were very dated and were not great, but the room really did make up for the bathroom. The sheets used by the shearton are top notch and soooo comfy. Another handy feature used by this hotel is in room check out which was great."
"Review_13695","hotel_182","hotel_6966","Sep 9, 2008","Very much Satisfied I should start off by saying I booked this 2 night stay (9/6 to 9/8) through my sister who works for Starwood. This might have had some impact on the room I was given  my experience.Check in/out was quick even though we were early for check in by a few hours.We were on the starwood preferred guests floor. I don't know what that entails. I was in room 2665 which had a king size bed, desk  chair, flat screen tv (32 inches I think), sofa chair w/ foot rest, small ottoman under a full length mirror, and a cushioned bench at the foot of the bed. The mattress was VERY comfortable. The room was clean. It had 2 huge windows (corner room) which had fabulous views of boston.The maid service was good. Replaced all towels  toiletries  tidied up. We used valet parking. It was about $40 a day. They ask that you give 30 minutes notice that you need your car but they will get it to you in about 10 minutes.Internet is $4.50 for 1/2 hour or $9.00 for 24 hours. Doesn't make much sense to me but we went with the 24 hrs.We also had some phone charges when the only thing we called was within the hotel. We probably should have questioned it. It was a couple of bucks.The bathroom was clean. Not the newest but it was pretty nice  clean. The toilet flushed SO loudly. It was almost like an airplane. It woke up my husband one night when I used it in the middle of the night.We ordered room service breakfast one morning. The lady who brought it was very nice  rolled it into the room  set everything up for us. The food wasn't that great though. I had a coupon for 50% off otherwise it would have been very expensive for mediocre food.All in all, I liked the hotel  would stay here again. The negatives I listed didn't affect our stay very much and as my husband says, I am extemely picky  notice everything."

It was dark and shabby and smelled of old smoke. It also had 2 double beds and we had booked a king. After waiting on hold for 10 minutes with the front desk, we finally went back downstairs to complain. Finally we were given a room on the top floor (29th) of the south tower. It's a Starwood Preferred Guest floor. Wow! Very nice. New and tasteful carpet and furnishings, and a fabulous view of the Christain Science Plaza fountain through a huge picture window. What an improvement! I'm so glad we didn't settle for the first room."

My room was very clean, pretty, and comfortable. I also found the staff to be very friendly, even confirming my late arrival with a personal email. The hotel food, however, was terrible. Not much better than TV dinners. Also, they could do better to soundproof their rooms as you can hear everyone coming and going when they open and close their room door-- it is very loud. A nice benefit of this hotel is that they have about 10 free computers for use in the lobby. It is very convenient if you need to work or just check email. Also, the setting is nice.Would I stay here again? I would probably stay across the street at the Marriott where I stayed a few months ago -- the rooms there are smaller but there is much better food and much better sound proofing. (Both hotels are connected to the mall and conference centre via an enclosed skyway)."

As far as conference hotels go, this was definitely one of the nicer places I've stayed in. The staff were nice and courteous and the room was clean. The other nice aspect of the hotel was it's direct connection to a large mall on the second floor. In addition, you could not beat the location. There were several malls and tons of shopping in the area. We were also walking distance from trollies (i.e. subways) and historic tourist sites. While not charming like boutique hotels, it was satisfactory for a large chain."

I woke up in the middle of the nite with bug bites all over my body. Not only I had to pack everything and move to a different room, I had to ask this rude staff over and over again for some itch ointment. The staff is very unprofessional and they treat you like as if you're bothering them when you call. I can't believe I'm paying all this money(although my company is paying for it) for this kind of service. I tried to walk over to Hilton, but it's sold out. Also, ask for South tower, I think that's the newly renovated tower. I'm still stuck in this old north tower with worn out carpet and furnitures, but I hope the new rooms are cleaner and don't have any bed bugs."

The elevators were super fast when we stayed there. Great location within walking distance to Fenway well really you can walk about anywhere from here and one of the trolley tours stops right across the street from the front of the hotel. However every night we had noisy neighbors. The first night the staff had to come get on to them for being loud partying. The other two nights the couple were doing other things...My husband had to beat on the wall at 4:30 in the morning to get them to be quiet.When I told staff about it the next day they did give me all of my room charges basically free. Still doesn't make up for lost sleep though. So beware of very thin walls here. Otherwise a great trip and can't wait to come back."

The hotel is a typically anonymous conference style hotel with a dark and somewhat depressing reception and slow front desk service. Our 2 adjoining rooms on the 19th floor were really good. The beds were comfortable, the views excellent and with all the facilities you would expect. The gym is big and the pool, whilst not so big ,was enough to keep the kids happy. We used the sun terrace and the jacuzzi. And the location is great. So not the place to go if you are looking for character or special hotel experience, but it really did the job for us."
"Review_13703","hotel_182","hotel_7233","Jul 31, 2008","DIRTY Room / RUDE Staff My husband and I and three children were disappointed with our stay at the Sheraton Boston last weekend (July 26th - 27th).For starters, before arriving we called the hotel to request two beds and a rollaway cot in the room. The person with whom we spoke was quite rude and stated that since we booked through Priceline, she could not accomodate any of our requests, that we were wasting our time speaking with her and we would have to see what was available when we arrived.Be forewarned, as mentioned in other revieiws, when we arrived, we were informed that the only option for parking our car was through the hotel's valet for a cost of $41 per night.At check-in we requested a renovated room, but we were given a room on the 25th floor of the non-renovated tower. At that time we requested a rollaway bed/cot. The 25th floor looks worn (scratched doors, frayed carpet) and our room was horrible (looked like it was decorated in the '80s) - smelly with a huge stain in the middle of the carpet, stains on the dark blue duvet/comforters, rip in the blue velvet curtains, hairs and mold in the bathroom, dirt inside the drawers and a huge TV that looked about 10 years old which didn't get reception on several channels. We complained, but were told that since we booked through Priceline, our room could not be changed. (Regardless of how one books their room, it seems to us that guests should be enititled to clean, pleasant rooms...)Three hours after we had checked in, we still had not received the rollaway bed. We called the front desk to follow up, and after another two hours (long after we had hoped to put our youngest child to bed), the bed was delivered without any extra pillows or blankets. When we requested these items from the guy who delivered them, he told us that these items were not available because they were all really dirty.Our kids swam in the pool, but the hotel does not employ any lifeguards, so parents have to keep a close eye on their kids. Due, in part, to the retractable roof, after sundown the pool area is poorly lit, and it's a bit tough to keep track of three kids in the pool without adequate lighting.To get to the bathroom/locker room from the pool, you have to go through a freezing cold area where the treadmills are located. The locker room is gross - uncleaned toilet, filthy showers, hair dryers sitting in puddles of water (not very safe). All of that being said, the location of the hotel is fabulous - in the heart of Boston and attached to the Prudential Center which is an upscale mall with several restaurants and a great food court (which is convenient when you have kids to feed). There are several other hotels in this area, and we suggest that if this location appeals to you, that you stay in a different hotel."

Sad to see where it's goneThe service is still courteous with a smile, and you can't beat the location, there is a T stop in the prudential center doesn't get much better for getting around. Reading some of the other reviews I found myself agreeing more than not. I've been here in Boston for the last 5 weeks. I hav stayed at the Marriott and the Hilton all with in a stone throw of the Shraton. Sadly I rank this one third.Whats Good.Decent sized rooms, and hands down the MOST comfortable beds of all the chains in the area. That's important to any business traveller. Quality towels and Bath products. Sheraton doesn't allow those old frayed towels. The Pool, Gym and lobby are great as well. Also again the Service is good, everyone projects helpfulness and I believe they are sincere.What needs improvement. Well for the bucks it's competitive, but frankly this hotel is in need of some major renovation if it wants to compete with the in room amenities of some of the other hotels. The TV's and remotes.. well leave much to be desired.Small Desks- Mine looks like a chouch end table. Not muchto spreadout on, and If I ordered room service I'd have to move my laptop to the bed. The toilets look they are right out your high school gym. Clean yes, but old cracked tiles with stained grout stands out. The Lamps are flecked with chipped paint from years of use. And I am wondering the last time my phone was cleaned, as there is an interesting film around the ear hole.Also No in room safes.For a business traveller, well frankly it leaves you wanting more. It reminds me of the old Hamton inn's before the national makeover. But again The bed almost guarantees you'll sleep well.Personally I prefer the LAN connections to wi fi. So for m that's a plus over the Hilton across the street. (All Wi Fi)Personally I haven't tried the food, becuase there are MANY great eating places all within walking distance. The menu looks typical. There's a burger, Pizza, a few salads etc. Again I recomend eating out just for the variety.Overall nothing special, it's a hotel, that's seen better days, but hey if you in Boston and just hanging out in your hotel room...well you have much bigger issues than a hotel needing some TLC."
"Review_13706","hotel_182","hotel_9575","Jul 26, 2008","So So The Good - Good location, friendly staff on check in, and many of the amenities that a business traveller might need. The valet and bellman in the lobby were all very helpful and courteous. There is also a full service Starbucks (not just a cart) on site in the lobby.The Bad-Sheraton really needs to work on giving the rooms a good scrubbing. There were stains on the carbet near the bed which did not help their cause.Also, the floor right along the floor boards needs a good vaccuming with the crevice tool. I also had a plate in my room which I brought up on Day 1....it stayed with me until Day 5.The Ugly-The room was terribly small and a little tired. The doors were so narrow that they remind me of those on a cruise ship where space is really limited. Also, the bathroom was uncomfortably small, especially when staying sharing the room with the Mrs.Conclusion-This is definitely the spot if you're looking for a good priced, centrally located hotel with a reputable brand and don't plan on spending lots of time actually in your room (i.e., you just go there to sleep and shower).Otherwise, if you are the type of traveler that also values your aesthetics of your room, then you might want to consider other options."

We were near the ice machine and elevator which we enjoyed for convenience. Loved the pool area. Wish there had been beverages and snacks available there.

After arriving several hours late due to storms in the Boston area, we were told there was only one room left with a king-size bed (hard to believe, given the size of the hotel) whick we took. After seeing the nice lobby, the large stain (close to two feet across) which greeted us on the hallway floor near our room did not leave a good impression. The room turned out to be a handicapped-accessible one; on the plus side, the bathroom was large, on the minus side, the overall dimensions of the room were lacking. There was only one washcloth in the room - we called the front desk, and several more were quickly brought up. While unpacking, we noticed that the bottom of one of the drawers was coming apart, and, behind one of the nightstands, was trash that had been left by previous guests. The next morning, we noticed that the showerhead would not stay in position. We reported these three problems to the front desk the next morning. The trash was removed and the room cleaned, but nothing was ever done about the showerhead, the broken drawer, or, later, the toilet that flushed like a min-geyser.The bed was very comfortable, but the tv was old (no flat screen) and internet was not wireless. The closet was very poorly laid out, since it had been adapted to be accessible nothing longer than three feet could be hung in it without being folded over.The location of the hotel is excellent, as it is attached to a mall, and across the street from a subway stop, as well as being in walking distance to many shops and restaurants. The pool was nice as well, and business services were fine.Would I stay here again? Definitely not if I were paying rack rate. This hotel needs to improve its housekeeping, which tends to be inconsistent, as well as its maintenance. It is very convenient if you are attending an event located in the attached convention center though."

I've spent some downtime in the lobby previously and was impressed with the decor, business amenities and the big starbucks. This time tho i stayed as a paying guest of the hotel - and tho the lobby is still a beauty - this hotel definitely has problems. To begin with - $41 per nite come and go as you please valet parking. That my friends is a shakedown. Next - once you ride the elevator up from that beautiful lobby - the hotel proper is less than appealing. My room was on the 24th floor and the carpet in the hallway was outdated and dirty looking. The doors to the rooms were scratched up and in poor condition. The room itself was of decent size with perhaps the best view i've had at a city hotel in years - looked out over the river and to my left i could see the dreaded Fenway - just an amazing view. BUT, the room felt not dirty - but almost dirty. The carpet was old and like in the hallway - didn't seem clean. As i walked barefoot in the room, i was a bit turned off to the feel. The TV was some 1990's tube with a horrible picture and relatively little channel choice. Where is the FLAT PANEL. Even worse, the in-room internet was wired - NOT WIFI. Did i take a trip back to the 90's? No Wi-Fi and no flat panel = no future visits from this road warrior business traveler.

If you have a river view it makes the experience nicer. They renovated the lobby areas(bar and internet kiosks), but the rooms are average and the bathrooms are screaming for help. The beds are wonderful. Got a last minute wonderful rate with breakfast included.

As a Starwood member, I was upgraded to a room on one of the top floors with a fantastic view of the Charles River. The woman at reception was very nice and even though I was early, they had my room ready for me.The room was average (aside from the great view) both in size and decor, although it did have that fabulous bed. The entire hotel felt dated with limited decor or ambience. I'm sure they cater to conventioneers, but I like a little more character to my hotel. The bathroom was very small and since there was no fan, the door needed to stay open when showering. Great Bliss products, however and better towels then many hotels.The only true negative was at the bellman's desk. As I and several other guests approached to check bags for a couple of hours, the bellman at the desk hung up the phone and walked away w/o acknowledging us. We all then waited about 5 minutes before another bellmen came from outside and very brusquely checked luggage with no eye contact or ounce of friendliness. When I came to retrieve my luggage, the different men at the desk were very pleasant, as was the doorman that hailed me a cab.All in all, if the price was right, I would most likely stay here again because of the location, but I would probably shop around for a hotel with a little more charm first."

The room was drab, the view was awful- pipes and ugly buildings. The room was wildly dusty- as if it had not been used in months. Even the fabric lampshade had a coating of dust.The bath vanity was way low. I am 5'1 and it came to mid-thigh on me! The tub had some mildew starting. The TV would not work from the beginning. Although I called twice, no one came to fix it. The front desk was friendly. The porter (Hispanic name) was wonderful, but his boss snapped at him for taking too long with me. (He wanted him to help someone else.)There was free internet in the lobby. There were also apples at the front desk- a nice touch, and tasty, too.The hotel was very conveniently located in the mall/convention center complex. It was not as convenient as the Westin, though, being farther from the T and Newbury St. All in all, I thought this was a pretty mediocre hotel. I would have been upset if I had had to spend more than one night here."

It's connected to the mall, free wifi and Kiosk computers down stairs, complete with Starbucks. It also has two separate wings. Make sure you go for the North Wing (to the right when you get in) as it's a world of difference. The South Wing looks worse than a Holiday Inn and should not be more than $80 bucks a night. The gentleman at CheckIn was kind enough to inform me that I would rather stay in the North Wing. My friend did not get the same courtesy and after checking out his room, we had him switch immediately. The staff are great as well. Very friendly.The bad things: No wifi in the rooms. No smoking rooms, old carpets and are you ready? RATS in the hallways. No kidding around. We had booked the business rooms in the South Wing for our staff and sure enough, we see a small creature on it's way to work.  I'll be fair with my overall experience. You should get what you pay for. The North Wing should be $180 a night and the South Wing should be $80. You want a great hotel, stay at the Intercontinental.

The work desk itself was so small you could hardly put down your laptop.As I unpacked, I noticed hairs on the pillows and started getting the uncomfortable feeling that the hotel was not that clean. Little did I know that as soon as I opened the bathroom door, a HUGE ROACH was waiting inside to welcome me. I called management, they said they were sorry and send somebody to clean up, He got there 45' later. But, of course, I checked out the next morning.My rate for one night? A mere $350 + tax... Roaches included...Stay away!!!"

The staff were friendly however the North Tower rooms leave much to be desired. Upon our arrival we were placed in a room that was in serious disrepair and very small: the comforters were lumpy, stained carpets and the bathroom was very tiny, dingy and had stained tiles. We asked for a bigger, more updated room and were promised a recently renovated unit. To our surprise the room looked as exactly as the other -with one change, the bathroom vanity had been replaced with a granite and wood unit. The room was still very small, only one lamp worked as the rest of the lamps didn't have any lightbulbs, plus the TV remote didn't work. Given all the choices in Boston, we would not stay here again. p.s. a friend stayed in the South Tower and LOVED his room - big room, bed and bathroom and flat panel TV - if you stay here request a new room in the SouthTower :)"

We decided to choose a place in Back Bay, since we hadn't spent much time in this area. The hotel ended up being pretty close to a lot of funky shopping and some pretty nice restaurants. The hotel staff were friendly and the room was spacious and clean. The price was a little steep for me, but if I could afford it, I'd love to stay here again for a longer time!!"

The Sheraton Boston is, in general, a nice hotel but didn't offer much in the way of making their guests feel like home (like many small hotels do). Upon arrival we were greeted by the nice bellmen and they explained that it would cost $42/night to park our car! I was flabbergasted!! I figured it would cost something to park, but not that much!! We had no choice but to eat the cost. Because of it, we never got to do a few things we had planned for the week (as we were on our honeymoon and short on extra funds - after paying for the wedding itself).When checking in, the woman at the desk overheard us talking about it being our honeymoon and upgraded us to a suite, which was quite nice. The beds are comfy, but the room was lacking. No fridge, no safe, $5 for 30 minutes of internet use and the bathroom was pretty awful. Our apartment bathroom at home is nicer than this one...and that is saying a lot. The tub was plain, showerhead was awful and the lighting was terrible. I really expected more from a suite bathroom.The Sheraton was a good place to lay our heads in between Sox games and touring the city, but we will not return."

We received an amazing deal on Travelocity and even though I was a little leery about the large size of the hotel (I feared it would be impersonal or cold), we received very personal service and prompt attention at the front desk. The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel was quiet. The Sheraton has a great location close to Newbury Street and conveniently attached to the Prudential Center where you can find anything you need!!! I highly recommend the Duck Tour - it was a wonderful time - and you can purchase the tickets right in the Prudential Center - just be sure to line up early (outside the Prudential Center) for the tour!"

Our rooms were excellent with very comfortable beds . The day before the trials was our one full day in Boston (first time!), so we were up early (7:00 a.m., which was 4:00 a.m. our time!). We ate an early breakfast in the Apropos Room. We did not go for the buffet, as we are light eaters. I had a fruit bowl, bread basket, and my husband had the eggs with ham. We also had juice and coffee. We did not check the price of the juice and coffee, but the other choices seemed reasonable. Our bill with tip was $55.53! The charge for coffee and juice was very high! We later complained to the front desk and were told that they get many complaints about this, but there was nothing they could do. We could have had two buffet meals which included juice and coffee for $40.00 plus tip. Avoid the Apropos Room if you are light eaters!"

My first room was a queen $439.00 one night stay. The queen room was 10 feet by about 14 feet in size. The room next to mine was being worked on (banging drilling, talking workmen etc.) keep in mind I booked my trip more than a month ago. and was given this room even as a strwood member. I went to the desk to ask (quietly) if there was a king room available. Without hesitation the guy at the fromt desk gave me a beautiful room over looking the Charels, with a huge king bed for the same price and a much cleaner and larger version of the queen room. My question is.....WHY WAS I TREATED SO POORLY BEFORE I COMPLAINED? There is no reason to give those dirty old queen rooms to people if you have rooms available. I was in Boston for a business and pleasure visit, but will never stay at this property again. I am in Boston several times a year. I will go back to the Westin."

It's a great choice if you're in town for the Boston Marathon, you don't even need to go outside to get to marathon central at the Hines, and all the shopping and dinning you'll need. (Unless of course you head to the North End for pre-race pasta) Last time we were in a small room with our two boys and could barely walk around the roll away bed. This time our room was in the part of the hotel closest to the Prudential Center and it was quite spacious. It had a king size bed and pull out couch. The kids loved the pool, the adults enjoyed the hot tub. The fact that they allow you to use the fitness facilities to shower after the marathon is over (well after check out time) is a nice plus. We ended up arriving quite early in the morning to catch the olympic trials for the womens marathon and had no trouble leaving our car and suitcases. Once the race was over (still well before check in) we were able to get our room keys and relax in our room. The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was very clean, the bed quite comfortable. We called for extra blankets and towels and had them delivered within minutes. I'd like to have had a mini bar/fridge in the room. The only negative for us was the pompous concierge--the short one on duty in the evening--avoid him and talk to one of the women instead."

Just returned from Boston today, and have to say that the Boston Sheraton was a great place to stay for the Boston Marathon and for it's location overall. I had read the prior, mixed reviews, and can tell you I was highly satisfied. We (my children and I) were on the 27th floor, nice room, nice bathroom. Everything was clean, and just what you wanted and needed in a room. The hotel pool and gym facilities were top notch. Free internet service right by the Starbucks. Concierge desk was very helpful. Lots of runners stayed there and there was a cool vibe all weekend. It was easy to get to the T, shop and eat in the Prudential Center, pick up the race packets from the attached Hynes Convention Center, and to walk around the Back Bay neighborhood."

It is near Fenway Park and walking distance to the Shops at Prudential Center.The T subway station is around the corner from the hotel. I am planning on returning to Boston in the winter.

"Review_13736","hotel_182","hotel_7992","Mar 27, 2008","Great City Break in Boston My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton for one night over the Easter weekend. When we arrived we had our hire car valet parked, and our luggage was taken into the reception area for us. Check-in was very quick and efficient, even though we arrived 2 hours before the stated check in time of 3pm.We were given a room on the 24th Floor of the south tower. It was a corner room, with full height windows to two sides, giving us a great view across Boston. The room was very comfortable, and looked to have been recently redecorated. The bathroom however looked rather tired, and although clean, was in need of refurbishment.Despite being a fairly upscale Sheraton the room lacked certain features : there was no in room safe, which meant any valuables had to be left in safety deposit boxes at reception; there was no mini bar, or complimentary water, although coffee/tea were provided; there was no shower cap in the bathroom, and only small quantities of shower gel etc. These are, however, minor issues, and did not impact on our overall enjoyment of the stay.We were on a room only deal, but there is a Starbucks in the reception area where you can get coffee and muffins if you don't fancy the hotel's full breakfast. The free internet service in the lobby is a real bonus, allowing us to check in for our return flight with ease.The hotel links directly into the Prudential centre, a mid-scale shopping centre with a reasonable range of shops and restaurants. This in turn links to the upscale Copley Plaza shopping centre, definately worth a visit! Directly opposite the Sheraton (outside the Hilton hotel) is one of the stops for the Boston trolley bus sight seeing tours, and Newbury Street is a short walk from the hotel.Overall we had a great stay. The hotel is conveniently located, and accommodation of a good standard. Would recommend it."

This time was the worst visit and the hotel played a major role in worsening the experience. The rooms lack the basic tiny things that we found in other hotels in other states including Sheraton ones as well. No safe inside the room to keep valuables. Lighting inside the room is poor and reading was a problem. Staff were nice but we were not able to get our bills in a way to report accurately to our institutions so they did whatever is suitable for them. Pets were another problem that initiated allergy for some colleagues. The breakfast was overpriced like any other hotel, but there was no balanced variety like in other hotels. Pork is not the favorite breakfast meal for many. The vending machine was out of order for ten consecutive days and may be more and when we called to complain the operator said try another floor. This is awkard especially the rooms do not have any mini bar. The telephones inside the rooms were not efficent. We were not able to hear the speakers also the fees for a call was expensive even within USA hotels. The only advantage is that it is related to the Prudential which is a great mall and outing space. Also its location is great where you can vist some places by walking and easy to get the trolley. I think some details can imporve the hotel."

I just got back from the Sheraton and i had been so scared aout staying there after reading these reviews. There was no need to be. A lot of the American reviewers expected a lot...huge rooms etc. The hotel is fab...you couldnt be in a better location so it is perfect for tourists. You are attached to the prudential centre through the 2nd floor..great upmarket shops and places to eat (eat in the top of the hub once it is fab). The t is also in the prudential and the trolley tours leave from right outside the door. It is a 4 minute walk to newbury street..again great shops and cafes. It is a 25 dollar cab ride to Logan and about 6dollars to Park Street and we paid 10 dollars to the Galleria (big mall in cambridge)The rooms were absolutely perfect. If you are used to staying iin hotels like the Radisson..the rooms are of similar quality..the beds are better tho! We booked a twin room and got 2 double beds, a huge TV, a big window, a nice desk and chair and a lovely coffee machine in the room. All in all perfect!The bathrom is a little small but not tiny at all...absolutely fine. We did stay in the south tower which was important to me after reading the reviews. From the corridors, it loooks a bit more modern. The lobby is beatiful, huge with lots of amenities and loads of nice places to sit and have a drink or read.It has a buzz about it too...always people coming and going.The staff in the side bar were lovely too, really friendly. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning for convenience, overpriced but fine. There is no need to eat there, eat in the mall!!Overall i really have few complaints!I travel a good bit, i have stayed in tiny European hotels and big 4 star hotel suites. This hotel really was more than i expected. If you are irish and are trying to imagine it... think of a 4 star Radisson at home and add about 1000 rooms and a much nicer lobby!Its not the luxury of the Fairmont Copley Plaza but i thought it was perfect. BTW, i booked on reserve-hotel.com. Got a rate of 93 euro a nite, an excellent rate!If yook via the hotel, you will pay about 3 times that!"
"Review_13739","hotel_182","hotel_1611","Mar 21, 2008","Nothing Special - A bit dingy Needed to stay in Boston and looked around for a reasonable rate but most of the main hotels that I have used before (Marriott, Westin) were charging around $250-$300 per night. This property was more reasonable so booked 3 nights via the SPG website chosing a Club room for $199 rather than a Standard at $159- Big mistake!The Room appeared to offer nothing much more than could be expected from a normal one and I agree with the other reviews here that the rooms are small (particularly the bathroom). The only difference was the fact that it was on the 26th floor (the top 3 floors are the 'Club Floors') the corridor of which was very dark and by staying here you got access to their 'Club' on the 29th floor which whilst providing basic breakfast esentials looked tired as was not the sort of place I'd have wanted to have spent a lot of time. Unlike previous lounges I have been to, it also charged for alcohlic beverages which made me wonder what was the point in paying an extra $40 per night if all I was getting for my money was a higher floor and a basic continental breakfast. Needless to say the first night I and a colleague went there and were told it was $4 dollars for a beer we left and went to a bar with better decor and atmosphere!The other complaint I have with the room is that there was no in room safe-this is normally always provided in US hotels of this standard - I only keep my passport, travel tickets and some cash in them when they are provided but they are useful and being told by the hotel that they have safe deposit boxes at Reception was not a great solution. This again left me wondering what I was paying for couldnt they put safes in the Club floor rooms to give an 'added benefit'?.I used the restaurant once for breakfast and the decor felt very tired and it was, like most hotels, overpriced for breakfast which I sometimes dont mind if it makes you feel like you are getting more for your money in terms of ambience etc.The hotel is however situated in a good location attached to the Mall with restaurants nearby (I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs in the Mall and if travelling further afield Maggianos, Abe and Louies and Ruth Chris).Staff that I encountered were pleasant and overall the hotel delivered (i.e. a clean and comfortable room) it was just that I thought I would, with the room type I booked, and the fact that I am a Gold SPG holder, got something better.Compared to the other hotels prices this still offered the best choice, however if you are going to Boston, compare prices and if you can get a deal at say Jury's or the Westin for $20-$30 dollars a night more stay there and leave the Sheraton."

There is no staff on site. I was doing interviews in the lounge when one of the hotel janitors came in and sat down in a massage chair, which is very close to us. He turned on the massager, closed his eyes, and was really enjoying himself. I have never seen a hotel staff taking advantage of the hotel amenities while on duty and in front of hotel guests. I asked him to come back in an hour and he left to vaccum the floor. It was 11am and I had to do the rest of my work elsewhere because of the noise. The hotel location is convenient being adjacent to a mall. I have stayed there 6 or 7 times in the past few years. I think I'll still come back to the hotel but definitely not the club lounge."

The rooms are smaller, but you can tell by the area that it's probably no different than other hotels around it. The ottoman in my room had a questionable stain on it; other than that, the room was very clean. At $20 for the duration of the stay, the gym was a bit expensive given the quality of equipment. I didn't use the pool, though, which probably adds a lot of value to the cost. I went to the bar for dinner, which is right off the lobby. The service was good, the food tasty. A big bonus is the mall that's attached to the hotel. It had everything from fast food to Armani and high-end stores like it. It gave me something to do at night. There's also a few great bars within walking distance to the hotel. The location really can't be beat. The only complaint I have about my stay regarded room service. The room next to me got room service one morning, and left the tray outside...it took the hotel almost 2 full days to pick it up! It wasn't anything smelly, so it wasn't a big deal, but it showed a lack of attention. Overall a nice stay."

Both Westin and Sheraton are considered 4 Stars. What a joke. Sheraton was disgusting. Gave us a room in the South Tower #1822. Hadn't seen a renovation in at least 20 years. Bathroom was sparse and what you'd expect in a motor lodge in a random town. Just very disappointing. South Tower is a bit scary too.

They were at my door within minutes. I had room service breakfast two mornings. Very quick, like 15 minutes. Hot and delicious. The concierge was very nice and helpful with tips and reservations for dinner. it was very nice to be able to just walk inside and within minutes be at 2 different shopping centers. There is also a Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs and Legal Seafood at these centers. Very convenient. Legal is ok, the service was horrible.

Thus, it was the maximally convenient location to be, and the network of walkways between the hotel, the convention center, and shopping/dining areas was very nice during this cold winter weather. However, a number of other hotels are also so connected, and we were disappointed at how otherwise completely ordinary this Sheraton was (especially considering the room rates). The lobby is grand, but the front desk was always understaffed. Corridors to rooms are narrow and dark, with a dark brown/flesh beige decor that looks dingy, tired, and dispirited. Room doors are unusually narrow (hard to imagine a wheelchair could even fit). The carpet looked tired and faded, and a noticeable strip of wallpaper was peeling off above the beds. Under the matresses the dust covers were very dusty, and one lamp had a large burn mark on the shade. The bathroom was small, with minimal amenities. So, a convenieint location if you are attending a convention, but by no means the place to go if you want any pampering, or a romantic getaway."

"Review_13758","hotel_182","hotel_8598","Jan 9, 2008","great location, great hotel We had a beautiful corner room on 28th floor with spectacular views.The room had everything you could need, only minor problem was the gap under the doors meant you could hear people walking past or in the next room, we were lucky as we were at the end of the corridor and no one went past.Hotel was very busy with a conference. We were on a room only rate and went to the Food Court in the ajoining Prudential Centre for breakfast every morning as did a lot of the delegates.Great range of shops in the Centre and you dont have to go outdoors.Be aware that Duck Tours are ONLY at weekends after ThanksgivingGreat location, T station in the basement,and within walking distance of lots of shops, restaurants and Boston Common.Highly recommended is The Cheesecake Factory in the Centre, wonderful fish and steak , great cocktails and fantastic service."

This time was no different and even more convenient for us as we were travelling with our 6 month son and its great that you can walk from the hotel to the malls without even going outside as we had some bad weather predicted for our stay so was worried it would be too cold for the baby. We are SPG memebers so got upgraded to a bigger room, although i must say the bathroom was the smallest we have ever had at the Sheraton, didnt overly bother us as its not as if you spend alot of time in the bathroom anyway! you cant beat the hotel for location."
"Review_13762","hotel_182","hotel_6234","Jan 3, 2008","Good but not the best around I have stayed here before and decided to stay around the holidays. I got a great deal being a SPG member (their hotel rewards program). I can't complain much about my stay based on the price but here is some info for others.The hotel is in a great location for shoppers, tourists and nearby conventions. The rooms are small but the beds are nice, clean and comfortable. Water in the bathroom was loud but the bathroom was clean. The work area was small and would be cumbersome for those on business. Do not get a room on the same level as the pool, the hallway smelled like chlorine. The only advantage to a lower floor was that I did not have to wait for an elevator- it was slow and crowded. The lobby was crowded and confusing to get to from the mall level. Staff seemed nice though I had little interaction with them. This is not a bad hotel, I would recommend staying there if you can get a price is right. For the same price you may be able to stay at the nearby, nicer Marriott or Westin."
"Review_13763","hotel_182","hotel_3452","Jan 3, 2008","Shelter from the storm On December 13, a terrible, sudden snowstorm threw Boston into monumental gridlock. I was there on a business trip, not familiar with the city. I spent 7 hours going 3 miles -- and eventually gave up trying to get to my destination and began looking for a place to stay the night. Calling hotels from my rental car, I found them all full. But I was eventually in front of the Sheraton, which had cleared their driveway, and I took a chance. They not only had rooms, they were offering very good rooms at $149 for walk-ins like me 鈥?when they could have charged any price! The room, on the 28th floor, was lovely -- just right -- a real comfort after a very bad experience in a city that didn't know how to deal with a snow emergency. Thank you, Sheraton Boston!"

The room was clean and large but outdated. The furniture was in OK condition but the room could use a refurb. They upgarded me to a mini suite that was more like just a corner room. The view however was amazing. I would stay again if the price was right."
"Review_13765","hotel_182","hotel_4968","Jan 1, 2008","Nice Location! The Sheraton in Boston has an incredible location if you're a shopper and/or love to eat! Its in the center of the Prudential, which has a connected walkway to Copely Square Mall. It has tons of shops and specialty stores. Good restaraunts to choose from or the food court at the Prudential has a variety of foods to choose from also. Not only that, you're within minutes to Boylston St. and Newbury St., plenty of shopping and food!The room was quite small. Not what my fiance and I are used to. We've stayed at the Park Plaza numerous times and the rooms there are much more spacious, although it needs updating. The decor at the Sheraton are up to date. Nice actually, just small. Very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a decent size. Check in was quick. The lines to the reception's desk were long!! Alot of the front desk people were working so it kept the lines moving quick. There's also a Kiosk computer center that you can check-in yourself. Its a self-serve center. All you need is your credit card that you used to reserve your room with and a receit along with your room keys prints out. It took less than a minute. I think every hotel should have that.All in all, the hotel and service was nice. Nothing spectacular, just average. Its not bad for the money at all. If you're in Boston for shopping, this is the place to stay!"

In contrast to many other rewievers this Hotel was above our expectations. It was as clean as an Mariott or 4 hotel, there was free internet service, very good mornings until 9 or 10am in the morning, the staff was very professional and overall it was more than acceptable. This hotel is not very expensive compared to similars and is very close of everything and it's in downtown you sleep in absolute silance. Of course if you don't minde to spend 4 or 5 time the price to stay in executive hotels you can do it but for people especially the young ones who take the hotel just for sleep and spend most of the time outside this is the best. Even for people with kids it posess everything you need. In summary, it's a Smart choice for Smart People. I recomend it to all, very safe, very clean very professional and not expensive around 100$ a night....sabe your many and spend it on Bourbon street..."

"Review_13780","hotel_184","hotel_8894","Jul 10, 2008","fair hotel, but they stole my money I had a very bad experience at this hotel. When I first got there, besides the awful treatment I was given at the front desk, I discovered that to use the parking lot I would have to pay an extra 18 dollars a day (information that, of course, was not available at the website). I was not sure if I would need the car for the whole duration of my stay (6 days), so I told the lady that I would park on that day alone, and then figure out what to do. Well, I decided to leave my car in the parking lot for two more days, and then return it to rental company. So, on this third day, I arrived at the front desk and told I was taking my car out, and that they should not charge me for the remaining 3 days. The new lady, that was as rude as one can possibly be, told me that everything was ok (and looking me as if I was asking the dumbest thing in the world). The last day came and... surprise! They charged me the parking for the whole stay. And of course, only the manager could change my bill, and he was conveniently not there (this was Thursday morning!). I had a flight to catch in less than two hours, so I reasoned with the lady at the front desk (the one from the check-in) and she told me that if I left such and such information with her the manager would be able to do fix everything afterwards. I did that, and after waiting more than two weeks with no result, I tried to call the manager. The two guys that were supposed to be in charge (Mr. Jay Vadhar and Mr. Robert Palmer) were never available, and when I finally reached one of them (Jay), he told me nice and easy that it was a misunderstanding, that he would reimburse me and so on. Silly me. Months passed and I am still waiting for my money. My calls are always directed to the answering machine, and all my e-mails never get a response.So, given the fact that besides this one there are several other bad reviews about this hotel, if you are thinking on saving money by choosing a nice cheap hotel near the quarters, please think again."

Got a room for the first couple of nights for $60 a night. They should have told me that thereafter it was $80 dollars per night but, still, good value all round.The Cons. Spookily quiet area. Remember much of NO's population fled Katrina's onslaught. It seems that many have not returned. Just a couple of blocks from the O' Keefe is the Orpheum Theatre - empty, and with posters up for its next performance - in August 2005 !. Next to the Orpheum, I thought I'd found home from home.The 'Piccadilly', an English pub next door to an Indian restaurant. Looked like they had been closed just as long. The area did'nt seem unsafe - just dead.The Pro's. The hotel is clean, comfortable, secure and good value. Quite well situated. Continental breakfast is fine. Communal ( free) internet. Walking distance from Canal St and the French Quarter. Walked to and from the French quarter each night. Did'nt feel threatened - not that there's many people round to threaten you ! Close to Amtrak/Greyhound stations.A fine hotel, all in all !"

I had booked my room late, and didn't have many hotel options; luckily, I found this hotel! Both the lobby and the room were clean, none of the funky odors people have complained about (even in a smoking room, it didn't reek of ashtray). Service was great during check in/out and the one time I had to get my keys reprogrammed. The walk to the Quarter was a quick one and a safe one at night. Parking was a little expensive ($35/night since it was a special event), but I was informed of the parking fees when I made my reservation. Never checked out the free breakfast; it ended at 9am, and I was never up that early.Not sure what other people are complaining about... maybe they were expecting the Hilton?"

We wanted to save a few bucks- it's 3 blocks from canal st- so walking distance wasn't bad- but could be dangerous at night- very secluded streets after dark. Upon entry the first thing I noticed was foul urine-smell as if everyone lifts a leg on the carpet upon entering and exiting. Carpets were very stained and grotesque throughout. Our floor (4th) reeked of vomit in the hallway. The keys rarely worked. We had to go back down to the front desk 3 times to get the keys to work. The air conditioner was very noisy and kept us awake at night. They do not offer extra pillows or blankets!! Most hotels have a closet with extras. . . yeah not here. I called the desk to ask for another pillow, we dont' have that. Very indifferent customer service. Oh and there is a surprise $5.95 daily resort fee for use of the fitness center, internet etc, even if you don't utilize those amenities. Shouldn't that just be part of the rental fee? Sheesh. What a disappointment. Continental breakfast was good though!"
"Review_13785","hotel_184","hotel_7010","Mar 12, 2008","Something's Odd about O'Keefe The hotel is near Canal st. and all of the tourist attractions. It is however off Canal st. so at night the car and pedestrian traffic diminishes tremendously. We stayed for only 1 night. We were only in our room for about 10 hours the entire trip from check in 10:30 am one day to check out 9:00 am the next day. Most of our time in the room consisted of showering, changing clothes or sleep. Our room smelled, the carpet was dirty and the furniture looks old and worn. The chair near the window had a cigarette burn on it. We had a handicap accessible room. The detachable shower head and rail in the bath tub was loose. A hotel employee followed us to our room and requested if she could enter our room and verify that we had all of the things our room was required to have before we entered.This hotel lacks the fresh look you expect when staying at a hotel. The pictures online are deceiving in relation to how the property actually looks. The staff is not professional. It took a really long time to check in. The employees did not have on uniforms. We felt the parking fee for one day was high. The hotel offers a hot breakfast in the morning serving eggs, grits, frozen waffles, bagels, fruit, cheddar cheese, butter and jelly.So if you are a family especially with kids, newlyweds, elderly, financially comfortable, professional in nature, quiet, not into dirty smelly hotels then I would not check into this hotel. If you are however coming to New Orleans to party with friends or alone and just need a place to stay for 1 night then the O'Keefe is your hotel."

The cancellation policy stated to call hotel directly 48 prior to reservation to avoid a penalty. I did just that, but found out that the hotel withdrew $524.96 5 days after I canceled. When I called the hotel, I was told I had to cancel 30 days prior, then I was told that I was emiled a special events policy, which I never was emailed to me. I have been jumping through hoops with the hotel, and the hotel has never replied to my letters or requests. I have contacted the NO  LA Hotel  Lodging Assoc., disputed the charge with my bank, and will contact the mayor's office, television stations, Times-Picayne, and whoever else I need to. Finally, I did receive a $388.00 credit, but have not received the rest. I will fight to the bitter end to get all of my money!!!!!!! Heed the warnings about this hotel!!!

I was amazed, frankly, by how nice this Hampton Inn was and how well it was run. As mentioned in other reviews, this is basically a regular Hampton Inn, but in the heart of NYC, so getting a rate on Christmas Day of $119 a night was amazing. The rooms are very large by New York standards, the staff is friendly and helpful, the breakfast is adequate (although take heed of the signs that between 8:30 and 10:00 a.m., it's a 'tumultuous' experience reminiscent of standing in line at a soup kitchen), and the amenities are very nice.

We chose this hotel based upon location, parking, and the morning breakfast.This hotel is a great location for people with children. The room we stayed in was larger than one we stayed in at a Holiday Inn downtown. It easily accommodated 2 adults and 2 elementary school children. The room is slightly smaller than an average hampton inn but larger than other NY hotels. The room was very clean and the area of town was nice ( not dumpy looking). It was fairly quiet at night. We were on the 5th floor and the 8th street side. We didn't hear any street noise. We did hear the occasional emergency vehicle; however it was very quiet.Next door to the Hampton Inn is a parking garage. We were able to park our car there and leave it without a problem. Hampton Inn will validate your parking card and give you a discount.The location was great for us. There is a subway stop across the street; however, we never took the subway. There is a CVS next door to the hotel. We were one block away from Mars 2112 ( 51st and 7th). This was a fun place to eat with the children. We walked to Times Square and to Rockefeller center. It was several blocks but we were able to do it with our children. We just made stops along the way... the mm's store, the hershey store, the FDNY store etc. There is also a Food Emporium across the street with sandwiches etc.We also walked to the musical we saw. We saw In the Heights.I chose a Hampton Inn not only because we used our Hilton Honor points and got it for free but because they offer breakfast. It is a real expense and pain to have to search for breakfast when you are with kids. It was great that we were able to wake up and go downstairs and eat. They had hot/cold cereals, coffee, hot chocolate, toast, pastries, english muffins, juice, fruit, waffles, yogurt, meat, and eggs.We did take a cab to the Empire State building and that cost $8 and that included a $2 tip.I highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay there again when we go to New York."

The rooms included a safe as well as iron and ironing board. The breakfast was good, with excellent biscuits. (The eggs were not anyone's favorite). The Gershwin theater is less than a block away.

We booked to see Hairspray on Broadway and it was only one block from the Hotel.The Hotel itself is very nice, the rooms spotless clean and a decent size especially for New York. We had plenty of room for the 4 of us including storage of our luggage and more importantly our shopping. I have stayed in the Ramada New Yorker in the past and their room sizes are very small in comparison. The beds are to die for at the Hampton and after shopping 10 hours a day they were a welcome sight every evening. Breakfast was great and a full choice for all. It set us before a long day shopping.The location of the Hotel is perfect for food and drink and entertainment. The Cosmic diner across the road is very nice and recommended by chef Ainsley Harriott. Rays pizza next door serves fantastic pizza and well worth a visit. The house of Brews bar around the corner is great although the cocktails are a bit pricey at $10.00 but it did not stop us having a taste of them all anyway.Overall a fantastic place to stay and looking forward staying there again when we return,"
"Review_13799","hotel_186","hotel_6579","Dec 20, 2008","Great location, reasonable price We came to The City to see a play and decided to stay if we could find a reasonable rate near the theatre. The Hampton Inn had a very good price (anything under $200 is low for NYC) for a late booking and a midweek night. We were very pleased with the location. Less than a block to our theatre and near a wide range of restaurants and diners. The staff was very pleasant. The room was very roomy, clean and comfortable. The free breakfast and adjacent parking were bonuses. The area is as safe as any; we felt secure walking back after the play. The guests included many families with young children (it was one week before Christmas so this may not be typical) and business travelers. We felt right at home in jeans and sweaters. We definitely will check this place for our next trip, and have recommended it to others."

The stay started out a little rocky, but the staff were very nice and accomodating and were cooperative on addressing the issues. The 1st room we were assigned to smelled like old cigarette smoke even though the hotel is supposed to be all no smoking. The 2nd room was placed on the backside of the elevator shafts, so we could hear the elevators rumbling up and down the shafts all through the day and in the early morning while we were trying to sleep. It made sleeping soundly a bit difficult. The 3rd room we moved to was definitely the charm with no issues. Even after the room issues, I would still stay at the Hampton Manhattan without hesistation. The staff were friendly and courteous, the cost of the hotel very reasonable for Manhattan, the rooms are clean and a good size as well, however the bathrooms are a little small, but completely functional nonetheless. Not to mention the terrific location of the hotel!"
"Review_13803","hotel_186","hotel_3195","Dec 11, 2008","First Trip to New York! Just returned from a fun trip to New York. My friend and I enjoyed staying in the Hampton Inn for many reasons. One reason for staying was the location. What a great location -within walking distance to shopping, central park, times square and boarding buses for other attractions. Also, we didn't use the subway but it was nearby also. I especially like the hotel providing breakfast and a coffee pot in the room. We had previously had a room at the Metropolitan Hilton Hotel and changed it because they didn't have coffee pots in the room. Who wants to get up, dress and run to a restaurant to bring coffee back to your room. Not only did we have a coffee pot in our room but they had coffee in the lobby at all times of the day and sometimes, if they were not out, warm cookies too. The breakfast is very good and they have quick breakfast bags made up for people on the run. Not having to worry about finding a place to eat breakfast is a plus to me. As far as our room, it was very adequate, a comfortable bed, bath water was always hot. We got a room with two queen beds. It was a little small and the bathroom small, but most rooms in New York, from what I've heard , are rather small. I would say the room is adequate for two people, if it's two women ,one using the bath room to dress and the other using the desk for another place to fix your hair, makeup and so forth. The concierge at the hotel was very helpful in getting us tickets to attractions. The hop on hop off bus was good to ride around and see the city but to get a good view you have to ride on the top row where, unfortunately , can be very cold. If the top is covered forget getting good pictures because the top messes up your pictures. Overall I would say the most frustrating thing was trying to use a map and figure out where things were. If I ever went back I think I would go just to shop."

I suspect the hotel was full when we were there (It was during the N. Y. Marathon.) but that did not affect the service.

"Review_13807","hotel_186","hotel_2058","Nov 30, 2008","Great staff and big rooms, wonderful place to stay. First time to visit New York City. The Hampton Inn was located at a great place, close to the theater, close to the tour bus office, within walking distance to 5th ave. and Times Square,Rockefeller center. 4 blocks to Radio music hall. And the hotel was so eager to help your stay be as nice as possible. A big bowl of fresh apples for you pleasure to snack on. Fresh Cookies in the evening. A hot beverage bar 24 hours a day, and the hot chocolate tasted so good after a cold walk in the city. The breakfast was really a nice treat every morning. I even would take a muffin and fruit back to my room for later and they were so sweet about it. I would definitely be sure to stay there on my next trip.  Only thing I can say negative is the rooms are not well insulated and you can hear the noise in the hall and the room next to you. But I use ear plugs so it was not a bother to me, but it did my friend. So be aware it may be a little noisy ."
"Review_13808","hotel_186","hotel_3209","Nov 28, 2008","Never again Although this review is based on a stay well over a year ago, I am again searching for a NY city hotel, and came across the Hampton Inn Times Square. Seeing the hotel jostled some very unpleasant recollections. I had a confirmed reservation for this hotel for a ONE WEEK stay with my daughter. We arrived late on the night of check in with a confirmed reservation in hand (for late arrival), which had been printed out on the day we left. After arriving, very tired after flight delays, we were told that they did not have a room for us. I was told that our room had been cancelled. By whom, I asked? By the travel agency I'm told. My piece of paper was worthless...the front desk staff seemed unconcerned and apologetic. It was midnight and I'm stuck in a city with NO HOTEL rooms (May is a very busy season in NY) with a teenage daughter. Finally, a young lady at the front desk tells me I have to run and catch a cab to the Doubletree, where they found me a room for the night at over 50% more. I figure I'll take it up with my travel agent the next day.My travel agent says the reservation WAS NOT cancelled, and that they would take care of things. The next day, we wait as our room is prepared. One of the front desk staff, a burly young man named John, approaches my daugher while she is sitting in the lobby (I'm not by her side at the moment) and tells her we'd better make up our mind whether we want the room or not, or they are going to give it away. She looks at him, completely bewildered and speechless. We take our room, and complete our stay. Upon checking out, I'm given a bill that is 50% higher than my confirmed rate. I was advised of this rate, but told my travel agent would fix it. I protest, but am told I must sign...I sign with a note that the rate is under protest. I note that I AM CHARGED for the night that I was turned away and had to stay elsewhere. Hotel policy, I'm told. SIX MONTHS later, my travel agent secured a refund for over 600.00 to my credit card because of the overcharge. I had stayed in this property prior to this, and had a wonderful experience (I chose it based on online reviews). However, things were very different on my return visit. I hope that perhaps the staff has again turned over and that travelers to this property do not have the experience that I had."

We decided on the Hampton Inn on 8th Ave. It was great! The staff was very friendly upon our arrival. The hotel was a short walk to Times Square in one direction and Central Park in the other. They offer a free breakfast every morning. I was expecting muffins and coffee. They actually offer a wide selection, cold cereal, yogert, scrambled eggs, French toast sticks, bagels. Did I mention free coffee all day long... Anyone who knows the prices in NYC knows that this free breakfast is a great bargin.There was a small shop in the lobby for the necessities. No pool or spa, but that wasn't a concern for us.Overall I was extremely impressed with all aspects of this hotel and would recommend this to a friend."
"Review_13810","hotel_186","hotel_2142","Nov 21, 2008","Great location, clean hotel I did a lot of research on hotels in NYC before we came for our 3 day weekend in November. After reading all the great reviews for the Hampton I decided it would work out best for us. I booked the hotel about a month ahead of time for $299/night. The week before I checked rates just out of curiousity and they were at $199/$239. I called Hampton and they immediately gave me the lower rate. Nothing like saving a quick $160!The hotel is located at 8th Ave. and 51st Street. It's 7 short blocks north to Central Park, 1 block south to the subway and only a few blocks to 5th Ave, Rock Center, and Times Square. And you couldn't walk anywhere without seeing a theater, seems like they were everywhere!Our room on the 6th floor was clean and we were able to check in early upon our arrival. They were also very accommodating to check our luggage on our departure day since we had a later flight.I have read that lots of hotels in NYC have small rooms but our room at the Hampton seemed normal sized to me. It had a king bed, desk and sitting chair and didn't feel cramped at all. Free high speed was easy to use.We didn't make it down to the free breakfast from 6-10, shame on us for being up too late partying! Actually we were up early enough but went running in Central Park (awesome!) and missed breakfast by the time we got back.Overall, I would stay here again on my next visit."

Everything we wanted to see was within walking distance. We were able to leave our bags as we arrived prior to check in, and they were waiting for us when we returned from a long day of walking.The rooms were very clean, and they were very comfortable. With sore legs and feet, these were the most comfortable beds in the world to us. :) Bathroom was great, awesome water pressure, and extra towels when we asked for them was no problem. Great pizza place accross the street for our cheap late night snacks. Also a convenience store right down the street. The breakfast that was included was great. Eggs benedict one morning, and eggs and mini sausages another. They also had breakfast to go bags at the front desk, with muffins/apples inside for busy travellers.The eating areas were a little busy, but there was plenty of food to spare, and something for everyone.The lobby was beautiful, and there were also computer stations which had free internet to use in the hallway.Overall we had a great stay here, and would love to stay again!"

We stayed 3 nights early November and found this hotel ideally located being close to Broadway and within easy walking distance of many of NYC's popular attractions.Staff at the hotel were incredibly attentive and friendly, from the moment we arrived until our final departure we experienced an impressive level of service.Our room was clean, large and comfortable, although looking a bit tired in places through age, our only negative would be the shortage of hangers in the wardrobe. A lockable safe in the room is a big plus for keeping the passports etc secure when you're out and about. If you are a light sleeper I would recommend requesting a room at the rear of the building, ours was at the front of the building facing 8th Ave which with an NYFD station just down the street was noisy at times.Location and the availability of a breakfast were the deciding factors for us, breakfast was good and plentiful but don't expect much in the way of a hot one, the choice was one or two hot items at best. The breakfast room itself, plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates were a bit disappointing though. always available coffee and afternoon cookies in the Lobby were a great reviver after our long walks.Overall a comfortable clean hotel having an ideal location for most of the midtown and the Theatre district. Excellent staff add to the experience."

"Review_13814","hotel_186","hotel_10376","Nov 12, 2008","great experience I booked this hotel primarily because of the price compared to others in the same area and secondary reason was some of the reviews I read on this site. I was a bit skeptical after reading some reviews but also read some good reviews. I'm glad we stayed there, the service was great, the room spacious, clean and modern. The King sized bed was extremely comfortable. The location was around the corner from the play (Wicked) we went to see. Checking in was a breeze even showing up at exactly 3pm (check-in time). There's a parking garage next to the hotel it's $30.00 per day after the hotel validates your receipt (saves you about $8 per day). Other garages in the area are priced about the same. There's is a complimentary breakfast in the hotel, pretty basic nothing fancy. The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the theaters and Central Park. The only thing I would have done different if I had known was request a room facing the front as opposed to a view of the parking lot, not a big deal. We had a great time and would definitely stay there the next time we go down to the city."
"Review_13815","hotel_186","hotel_1803","Nov 8, 2008","Great Location This was our firat visit to New York. We have been to other parts of the US and was a little unsure of what to expect of such a large city. We took our very first yellow cab from the airport to the hotel. It just started a load of great experiences. We were greated at reception by a lovely lady that had our reservation ready for us and knew exactly the length of our stay and the type of room we had requested. She also made sure that she pointed out the freshly baked cookies that had just arrived at the desk and the free coffee machines. Our room was just the right size for 2 adults and our 8 year old daughter. We had a room at the front of the hotel and enjoyed having a glass of wine looking out at the street with all the colours of New York in front of us. We found the rooms quiet and very clean. The beds and linen were always fresh and crisp. The breakfast was very handy. The signs outside the breakfast room advising how busy it was at different times in the morning was very accurate. We enjoyed the breakfast but it's a little different to what you would expect at an Australian hotel. There were always plenty of cereals and yoghurt if you didn't like the hot food. I still haven't worked out what the biscuits and gravy were. We would definetly stay at the same hotel. The cost was what you would expect of a good hotel in New York. Being so close to Times Square was fantastic. We walked through there so many times during our 4 days there. We did an all day tour of New York with Grayline tours and Surge was a brilliant guide with all the New York dry humour thrown in with it."

The location was great - having 3 different subway lines available within a 3 block radius was awesome! We also used hopstop.com for directions and times of how to get to specific sites. I would definitely recommend this place to families - I was travelling with my 7 year old and the staff was very cognisant of him and chatted with him while I was either collecting breakfast or speaking to another staff. As far as the breakfast bar goes - it was such a plus to have it available - what a savings! The hot breakfast items were great and changed daily. I also loved their fresh fruit salad and cold breakfast foods. We would grab a couple extra bagels and apples to take along as snacks while we toured the city. I almost forgot to mention about the cookies offered in the lobby mid-day and fresh apples throughout the day - such a great touch by the hotel. There is also a hot beverage bar that is available throughout the day(even in the late late evening) offering coffee, tea(several types) and hot chocolate. We found a grocery store (The Food Emporium) a block away where you can take away hot and cold foods should you feel like eating a meal in your room (great if you have kids!). What else? The room was clean and spacious with 2 queen beds. Housekeeping was great - our room was always ready when we came back for our mid-afternoon break and we were never lacking towels nor amenities. In the late evenings, the hotel security would ensure that you were a hotel guest which made us feel somewhat safe especially when travelling with kids. On our last day, the hotel was more that willing to allow us a late chekout (2pm) - which was great but I think you need to ask the night before as they only have a couple late checkout slots per floor. Lastly, the weather was awesome during our stay - what a great time to visit NYC! Hope you enjoy this hotel as much as we did! Cheers!"

The Lobby area is nicely decorated and spotless. It can get a little crowded when groups are checking in. My room was a King on the 10th floor facing 8th Ave. You do get a fair amount of FDNY sirens here as there is a station very near the hotel. Then again, it is NYC so sirens are a norm along with horns. I really wonder if anyone gets hit with that $350 fine in quite zones for honking. Room and bathroom were clean. Rooms are decent size, bathrooms are quite small though. You have your choice of wired high speed internet or WIFI, both are FREE. Also in the room are a lounge chair and foot stool, desk with ergonomic chair and dresser with a nice sized TV. Hotel is only one block from Times Square and an easy walk down 8th Ave to the theatre district.I only have one complaint about the hotel. The housekeeping staff need to learn to knock. There is a flip stop for the door. Make sure you use it. Twice just after check-in housekeeping tried to enter without knocking. From that moment the do not disturb sign went on the door. This is the only reason I only rated the hotel above average and not excellent.Free breakfast is available, however I'm not a breakfast person so cannot tell you much about how it is."

It is well located, a comfortable size and the rooms are spacious and clean. What's more, this was cheaper than the Radisson. The staff were friendly and helpful and this even had breakfast included. Breakfast is OK but we chose to eat out a couple of times to get the New York experience.The hotel doesn't look great from the outside but don't be put off, it is fine inside and perfectly OK if you are looking to stay in Central NY and want a bit of space."
"Review_13835","hotel_186","hotel_8474","Sep 27, 2008","Below average Had to return to NYC for a business trip and my company's travel agency placed me at the Hampton Inn. The location is great for tourists as it's right in the theatre district. Room seemed dirty and old. Not old like 'historic' but old as in they need to steam clean the carpets and really scrub down the bathrooms. Bathroom has modern fixtures and was very small. You can hear everything from other rooms when you are in your own room, including bad plumbing and tvs. Street noise is bad so be sure to ask for a higher floor if available.Free continental breakfast each morning. It was your typical Hampton Inn bfast and was good."

"Review_13838","hotel_186","hotel_1147","Sep 22, 2008","By far my worst stay in NYC... or anywhere I always spend a week in New york in early December and have had the pleasure of spending far too much money for decent hotels due to the holiday season. I expect to be ripped-off to a certain degree. However, my stay at the Hampton Inn Times Square was by far the worst hotel experience that I have ever had, and I travel often for work.I'll start with the good:- Location if you are interested in staying in the Theater district/Times Square area. Not ideal for shopping, but close to tourist attractions.- Room size isn't typical NY tiny. It is average Hampton Inn sized.That is it for the good.The bad:- The room was tired and of poor quality. Carpet itchy, bathroom icky, and bed not comfortable.- Snooty front desk. Seriously, at the Hampton Inn? I love the typical, slightly gruff, get down to business NYC attitude, but at checkin the service was distracted, unorganized AND had an elitist attitude. They lost my reservation information. I had to re-pay for the room and wait a month for reimbursement for a pre-pay. And, no one was apologetic. They were also too busy to answer the two questions via phone when called. Why have a front desk?- The breakfast was not even worth mentioning. A deal if you like cornflakes and bad coffee, but that is about it.- Speaking of coffee. The supposed everlasting help-yourself coffee, was always out even during regular breakfast hours. The coffee is horrible if you are lucky enough to get a cup and the little counter was a serious mess of trash and spills all week long.So, I maintained a positive attitude through the whole thing. Was always cordial to the service desk. I have worked in service and know it can be hard and customers can be demanding. I know that patience usually pays off. But the straw that broke the camel's back was:I attempted to fed-ex some paperwork back home and asked whom I should leave it with upon check out. Again, the extremely rude staff acted like I was an idiot and told me to leave it at the bellman's table. Since no one was there and I was a little nervous about the important documents that I was next-daying, I tried to reconfirm that it was ok to leave there. Again shunned and told rudely, it will be taken care of. Long story short - My package did not arrive for more than a month. I finally became irate with the hotel. No help was really offered although the concierge (who had been m.i.a. my whole week's stay) at least treated me with a little courtesy on the phone. The hotel had removed my shipping label and relabeled it with what they guessed was the correct airbill from another guest at the hotel. My label was brand new on a brand new never been shipped box? I don't know who could be idiot enough to make that error, and not even attempt to call the number on the package to verify if they thought it was a mistake? My package ended up with some very sweet mailroom clerks at a factory in the middle of nowhere that I had to personally track down. The hotel was zero help in getting my package back, even though they were 100% responsible for the error.I would have given this hotel a 1.5 star maybe 2, until the fed ex issue. I wish I could give it zero now.I would expect more for a hotel that I spent $65/night to stay in! I spent far more than that to stay at this unorganized, rude, uncomfortable and tired motel. Nightmare. Save yourself the headache and discomfort."

"Review_13840","hotel_186","hotel_5433","Sep 19, 2008","NYC at it's BEST!!! We came to NYC on a chartered bus trip from Tennessee; and it was a great experience due in part to the comfort, cleanliness, friendliness, and location of Hampton Inn North. Bed = super fluffy and comfortable. Room = very clean  roomy - considering it's New York. Staff = very friendly and helpful, everyone smiles. Free Continental Breakfast = great variety, good food - even biscuits and gravy. Location = probably one of the hotel's best assets, bring your walking shoes because you are within blocks of almost everything: Times Square, Broadway plays, David Letterman, Central Park, the subway (don't be afraid of it - get a map, and go about anywhere for $1.75 pp). There's also great New York pizza directly across the street!Hopefully we will stay here again - no need to take a chance on another hotel!A bit of advice for first-time NYC visitors. To get around the city, take the bus, the subway, a taxi...but NEVER EVER get into a vehicle that is not licensed by NYC. There are people out there driving their own SUV's (Yukons, Tahoes, and Escalades) and passing themselves off as a more luxurious 'taxi'. They will approach you and ask if you need a ride. They won't have a meter or identification displayed in the vehicle. And if you take that ride, you will pay at LEAST twice as much as a yellow cab...not to mention what could happen if you came across the wrong person offering you a ride."

Huge room with great bedding, nice bathroom, if a little on the small side. Desk, flat-screen TV and turn down service. Breakfast could have been improved and it was all served on throw-away plastic, which is so bad for the environment! But if you want a good place to stay that's convenient and quiet, this hotel hits the mark"
"Review_13842","hotel_186","hotel_5267","Sep 2, 2008","Tennis Open vacation I selected this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. This was my first visit to NYC in many years and the number of hotel choices was almost overwhelming. If you are a first time tourist to NYC I don't think you could have a more central location. Several subway lines are within a couple of blocks.(NYC is a walking city.) The hotel is in great shape and the staff are very pleasant. Breakfast is served between 6-10AM. The hotel promises chaos at the food bar after 9AM and does not disappoint. That being said, the staff does a fine job of keeping up with the crowds.The food selection is quite good.The only criticism I have would be the elevator crowding during the last hour of breakfast.The hotel has only 2 elevators and if you are on the lower floors, be prepared to wait. If you are staying on the 4th floor, or below, consider walking down."

The entrance closest to the hotel was too smelly and unused; two other entrances near the RiteAid were useful for the north and southbound subway trains.The wireless internet was a bit iffy and not entirely satisfactory; however there are two internet access points right outside the breakfast room that you can use for ten minutes at a stretch for free.We were always early in to the breakfast, so did not face the queue, it was adequate.Coin-operated laundry is not available in the hotel, but you have cheaper-than-hotel cleaners just around the corner."

All of the hotel staff were coureous and helpful during our stay.The rooms were large, modern and clean with free use of a safe within them.Breakfast was included in the cost and was buffet style with a good selection including cereals and hot and cold items. Our children had no problems filling up.If you wish to have breakfast on the go then there are free prepacked bags next to the reception area. There are also complimentary apples and cookies available from breakfast onwards.The hotel is well located - being only 10 mins from Times Square and 5 mins from Central Park and the main subway routes.We wished to travel through Central Park this time but did not want to walk. We were approached by the cyclists who said that the horse carriages only completed a small route and that they would give us 2 vehicles for $130, we were unsure as we wanted to travel together, however beware, this is untrue. We eventually went on the horse carriage which went most of the way round the park for $80 for the 4 of us.We stayed at the Wellington last year and although this hotel was a little more the decor and free breakfast is vastly superior, we would stay here again."

This was a getaway for my husband and I(much needed) Booked my trip through expedia...fine! no problems there. Chose Hampton Inn North Times Square as our hotel bc it was close and had breakfast included. Awesome, great service, good size rooms, AWESOME beds, feather conforter beds and pillows. will def be back there! Flight was great 6am is the best time to fly, no lines no problems! Got in at 7:35am got a cab to the hotel, seemed to be the best way as far as $ was concerned. Lived through it, nice cabbie! weren't able to get our room, too early but hey held bags for us and offered the breakfast. we walked straight to Times Square to get our NYC passes but didnt open until 10am, had time to kill. we went ahead and got the Greyline Hop on Hop off passes. we should have waited till we got out passes though bc they had a coupon in it. i would also suggest getting the City Sites instead, seemed to be a little more efficient. had 1 good guid the whole time, the others SUCKED! and some other bs came along with it! BEWARE time starts from when you purchace the ticket! just a note! Also the NYC passes start from the first time you use it...that counts as that day even if it's that night when you use it for the first time! FYI!! My suggestion would be to ride the loops around and see everything and then decide where and when you want to go to each place. Get a map of the subway and take it everywhere and study it a bit. can get very confussing! Walking, the loops and the subway are best ways to go! Places to eat: Carnegie Deli...awesome! HUGE portions...share! Cheesecake amazing! Lemonaid was even great! De Nico in LIttle Italy was very good! Pappaya King was aweful! don't waste your time, wish i hadn't. although the fruit drink was good! Serendipity lived up to it's reputation. Frozen hot choc. was awesome and carmel on icecream was good too, you will have to wait a bit though! 44 1/2 was awesome, it's between 44th and 45th. It seemed to be a mostly gay restaunt which was suprising to me but it was awesome. all male waiters wearing pink shirts with little funny sayings on them. Staff Nice as can be and food was really good! Got us in and out to get to our show on time. Wicked was AWESOME. i am a Wizard of Oz lover so it was really good for me. Gershwin Theatre right across the street from our hotel! that was nice. TOTR was breath taking. we went during the day and again at night! Greenwhich village at night we were told was great...didn't understand all the hype in that but were were exhausted by then! The Staten Island ferry is the best way to go if you don't want to go to the Ellis Island. Get great pics and a nice view of it and a little down time! Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge was awesome. We got a taxi over and walked back! China town Canal st lived up to its rep too. i got into a mini van on the side of the street with a lady and bought 2 couch bags. don't know if they're real but it was fun and got a good deal!! Subway to Yankee Stadium and got right back on to go back, lol! didn't hang out long! Dylan's Candy Shop was great. my daughter's name is Dylan so that was cool for us! every kind of candy imaginable! Tiffany and Co. cool to just go in! Rode a horse and carriage in park, was a let down, they charged too much and didn't see much of the park AT ALL! rode the bycle carriage through 5th ave at night. that was very cool and worth it. we were tired and too lazy to walk anymore! haha! St Patricks Cathedral was unbelievable! Just wanking down the streets and into the neighborhoods was awesome. especially away from the busy parts. if i think of anything else i'll write some more! Over all a wonderful trip. even figured out some things about my husband in those few days! lol!"

St., intersection was the main benefit. Time Sq., was only 9 blocks away on 42nd. St., the Ambassador Theatre was on 49th. Street (Chicago - The Musical, GREAT!!!) and the subway was on 50th. St..There were four of us in total (2 adults and 2 teenagers), so we took a room with 2 double beds. The room was large and clean. We asked for and got a quiet room facing onto the back of the hotel on the 8th floor.As expected given the other reviews on this hotel, the breakfast room always busy, when we arrived each morning at 8.45am. However, we were eventually able to get a table for four. In addition the lifts were busy at the same time period. So one just needs to be patient at the busy times.The food quality and range was good. The staff kept it well stocked for breakfasts. We had more than enough.The staff were efficient and business like. For example, one of my teenagers managed to block the WC in the bathroom at 2am one night. Once we notified reception, a man came within 5 mins., and had it fixed immediately."

Hairdryers and in-room safe were provided at no extra charge. The breakfast room was busy but not excessively so and the food was plentiful and of a decent standard. Fresh apples were always available at reception and there were sometimes cookies too. There was tea, coffee and hot chocolate available 24/7. All staff members we encountered were friendly. Breakfast bags were available for early departures but when we needed them, we were leaving 10 minutes before they were due to be put out and could not be accommodated - hard luck!

The location of this hotel is great. The broadway shows Wicked, Jersey Boys and Hairspray are across the street within a block or two and the Grayline siteseeing office is just down the street. Times Square Church is on 51st straight across from the hotel. Times Square is about a block away. This hotel is in midtown so you will be within walking distance of most midtown attractions.

The hotel is basic and charmeless, I was disappointed when I saw it, since I had read the reviews on Tripadvisor which were very positive (God knows why). In the middle of the night, my 9 months old baby wook up since, due to the very tiny walls, she could hear the telephone conversation that the lady staying in the room next door was having with one girlfried (nothing interesting, anyway).In the morning no way to have the breakfast since there was a 20 minutes kew (it seemed to be in an army barrack, not in a hotel) . Anyway, I thought, let's stay two nights more: the rate (219 USD) seemed to me, at the end of the day, not too bad for New York. I spoke to the manager who told me we will try to do our best to allow you to keep your rate. Unfortunaly that was not true at all, the price for a week day was 499 USD! At this point I decided to spend 7 dollars more and go straight to the Waldorf Astoria where at least I was in a first class hotel and not a third class motel pretending to be upscale."

The hotel was in a great location for Broadway plays, we were there to see Wicked which we could just about see from our window!The room was clean, a normal size, bathroom a bit small but bigger than most in Manhattan! Everything worked, check in was a breeze, hotel parking was a bargain for the city at $26.00 a day and there were cookies there every afternoon, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate 24 hours a day.I was so surprised at how quiet it was, we hardly heard anything, maybe once and a while a siren or a horn but when you stepped outside it was loud. I guess they don't build them like they used to. We've been at many Hampton Inns and they were not quiet at all. The hotel was busy and there was a very long line for breakfast, the first day they were out of bagels! Imagine, out of bagels in NYC, but they had grits? We opted to eat breakfast down the street the 2nd day and then saw people getting on the elevator with tons of breakfast way past the breakfast hours?Other than the breakfast which to me is always Hampton Inns weakness, a Great stay, no problems at all!"

Broadway shows just minutes away. We ate at Sombrero's Mexican just around the corner, and it was good. Also, La Tommasino's (or something) which was very expensive for the value.

Selected this hotel because of location and free (included) breakfast. Hotel is a short walk from the Gershwin Theater, home of Wicked. Did the behind the scenes tour (highly recommended, daughters loved it) and the Saturday show. Could walk back and forth from hotel. First room smelled musty, so asked for different room. No problem...second room fine. Was personally taken to the room by Silvio to make sure was all ok. He checked in with us each evening to see how we were enjoying our stay. Didn't really expect this type of hospitality in NYC. Four stars for Silvio...they should keep him there. Rooms are typical Hampton (nice), although maybe a bit more worn (because of the high amount of use I suppose). They are re-doing some wallpaper etc to spruce up. Maid did a very nice job cleaning the room each day and should be commended. I'm pretty pickey about things, and I'm not beyond asking for changes or a discount if things are not right. Not the fanciest NY hotel, but still good. Breakfast was very good but room could get crowded. On Saturday there was a long line out the door to get in...but thankfully we had eaten early and had a much smaller crowd to contend with. Other days were ok. We enjoyed our visit and would stay here again if we return. We all commented to each other on how well everthing worked out so well staying at this Hampton Inn."

We had a king size bed and our room was on the 11th (top) floor and was quiet.Breakfast can be a bit of a scrum. On Sunday we arrived at the breakfast room at 8.40 am, the vast majority of tables were taken and there was a huge queue. This subsided by about 9.40, but they didn't run out of food!The hot option consisted of two items each day, so on the Sunday we had waffles and sliced sausage, so don't get the idea that you will be eating your usual holiday full English breakfast!One good touch is the availability of hot drinks during the day from Reception. There is a lady stationed in the lobby who can give helpful information on restaurants, sights, help with travel etc. and she is a mine of information.On average we paid 150 pounds a night."

This stay was actually paid for with hotel points, but it was great. Go to the breakfast as early as possible or it is PACKED! Free apples and sometimes cookies at the front desk are a nice touch. Elevators seemed to take forever, but that is my only gripe. It was a great hotel for our family. No noise whatsoever. We requested a room on a high floor away from the elevator, and that is what we got. No complaints!"
"Review_13866","hotel_186","hotel_2525","Jul 4, 2008","Excellent Hotel Hampton Inn Hotel - 51st and 8th Avenue.This hotel is just down the street from the theatres, not far from Central Park, about 2 blocks from the subway station on 50th St, and an easy walk to Times Square.They have security at this hotel, though I don't know if it's really needed, as this is a safe area. I stayed by myself and walked from my Broadway show to the hotel (about 4-5 blocks) around midnight and felt totally safe all the way there.The hotel offers a deluxe continental breakfast with eggs, waffles, etc. There are two rooms to sit in and I never had a problem finding a place to sit. The front desk was extremely helpful as was the security desk when it came to information. The rooms are nice also - average size (bigger than the average NYC hotel from what I've heard). I didn't notice any difference with the size of the room compared to other cities I've stayed in.I stayed there in early April 2008 and would definitely stay there again (if the price is right - they are a bit on the high side, but that is just NYC prices)."
"Review_13867","hotel_186","hotel_2289","Jun 22, 2008","Walk to Central Park, Times Square My sister and I met my parents here for a weekend visit. We used hilton points one night and paid for two nights. It was an excellent hotel - clean, rather spacious I would say for New York, and a great location. It's within a ten minute walk to most museums and the park, within a two minute walk to subways and about a ten minute walk to the theatres. The free breakfast in the morning was completely packed each day, but despite the hotel being loaded with guests, we rarely saw them. On the last day, we left our luggage with the hotel since our flight out was later in the day - this was a complete ease and would highly recommend doing this if your schedule requires it. As with any large city, there was some street noise but just added to the charm of staying in the heart of Manhattan. The views left a lot to be desired but we were rarely in the room except to sleep."

To be honest, i was not expecting much, as everyone says most NY hotels are over priced and have small rooms. Three of us booked in, and got a room with two double beds. We also had a view onto the street! the room was a good size (never felt like we were tripping over each other) and had all the amenities you would expect, and a few more (playstations and pay per view movies on demand!) This is not a hotel you select on the basis of its pretty ground, or spa features, (cos who comes to NY for either of those!) but for its location. And it delivers. Breakfast was great, check in staff lovely, parking right beside the hotel, concierge service, and the hotel kept or bags after check in. The rooms were spotless, and have loads of little extras (mouthwash!! Body Lotion!!)Not amazing, but absolutely no complaints, and would stay here again! A solid bet for a city break hotel"

"Review_13871","hotel_186","hotel_6845","Jun 3, 2008","Lived up to expectation My 9 year old daughter and I recently had 3 days in Manhattan and stayed at the Hampton Inn. I chose it because of reviews on Trip Advisor and it totally lived up to expectation. It was really well located on 8th Avenue, just a short walk to Broadway and all the theaters, also close to the subway at 50th Street. The room was great, not too small, two fantastically comfortable queen size beds and was absolutely immaculate. The bathroom looked brand new and there were ample towels and wash stuff. Breakfast is included and although it wasn't gourmet, there was plenty to choose from and lots of room to spread out. I know that sometimes hotel staff can be unhelpful at best, and at worst downright rude, but all the staff of the Hampton Inn were cheerful and happy to answer questions about getting around New York. All in all, I'd say this was a top spot, good value for money in a city where the sky's the limit for how expensive things are and I'd happily recommend it to anyone travelling with children."

The rooms are spacious compared to other rooms I've stayed in in NYC (2 queens with lots of room to move around), quiet and very clean. The location is ideal for sight-seeing and attending Broadway plays. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel serves a complimentary breakfast every morning with a good variety of breakfast foods and coffee is always available in the lobby. Although there is no on-site restaurant, there are lots of restaurants within walking distance. There is a fitness room available for those folks who don't get enough exercise walking. In short, this hotel doesn't have all the amenities and the glitz of some more expensive hotels, but it more than makes up for it in location, cleanliness, friendliness of the staff and comfort of the rooms!"

This hotel was very good from a number of perspectives, a very good location, professional friendly staff and a great room size with comfortable bed.I had a slight glitch at check-in, which was quickly resolved to my satisfaction by John, the Customer Service Manager. The room I had came with 2 double beds, very comfortable mattress and lovely choice of pillows, with soft to firm. There is a coffee maker in the room, but frankly, you are much better off using the free always available fresh coffee units located in the lobby which has perfect coffee, including both regular, strong and decaf - they also had tea choices which I didn't use.The bathroom was clean, had a nice selection of shampoos and soaps, and loads of fluffy white towels. The water pressure for the shower wasn't very strong though, so one little issue. There is a small built-in room safe which operates with a key. There isn't a mini bar, but with all the choices of 24-hour places so nearby that wasn't an issue at all.The breakfast room in the lobby offers a hot breakfast together with other choices. I saw many items about this breakfast on Trip Advisor, and here is the truth ... this hot breakfast is not the traditional hot breakfast which anyone would normally expect to see. So there wasn't any scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, etc. What they did have was a choice of 2 premade omelettes, one plain and one with a cheese flavouring - by that, I mean, a cheese filling which was like a Cheese Wiz. And the omlet appeared to be made with an egg substitute. So was it ok? Well, if you expect a proper full hot breakfast, then no. It was tasty enough, but not the quality of a proper hot breakfast. On the other hand, it comes free with your room, and other hotels would charge you at least $20 for a full hot breakfast, so it was fine. In addition, they had all sorts of muffins, scones, cereals, yogurt and fruit. And, a very nice touch, was that by the front desk, they had sealed paper bags containing an assortment of muffins and other items, for those people who don't have time to sit down for their breakfast. On my 2nd day, they had a different hot choice, which was their version of french toast, cinnamon flavoured bread-like sticks, again tasty enough, but not really french toast.All in all, I had a very nice stay at this hotel and would return."

Close to theaters and great restaurants, and a wonderful place to make your base of operations for a trip to NYC.We were there for some shopping, eating and a Broadway show. We arrived well before check in time and the gracious staff allowed us to check in early. The room was spacious, clean and fresh smelling. Hampton Inn has the best beds and bedding, and this one was no exception. There was 24 hour hot beverage service in the lobby and the Hampton Inn breakfast in the morning. The breakfast is not gourmet fare, but has a number of good choices for the health conscious and the not so inclined. The morning that we were leaving, when I asked the gentleman at the front desk if we could check out an hour late, he did not hesitate to say yes. In summary, this is an excellent hotel with a friendly, accommodating staff -- everyone we encountered was EXTREMELY pleasant and friendly. I am impressed with the level of customer service that Hampton Inn delivers."
"Review_13877","hotel_186","hotel_8411","May 20, 2008","A Well Run Hotel in a Great Location By New York City standards the Hampton Inn is reasonably priced, and for what the hotel gives you, it鈥檚 almost a bargain [again, by NYC standards].LOCATION: Located on 8th Avenue between 51st and 52nd Street, the hotel is close to theaters, subways, delis, TKTS, and the bustle of Times Square. If you like to travel via taxi, if there鈥檚 not one waiting at the door, there will be plenty driving by on 8th Avenue. Eighth Avenue is bustling and at no time does one feel unsafe.THE ROOM: The room with one king bed is a comfortable size. My wife and I didn鈥檛 have to coordinate our movements to avoid bumping in to each other. In addition to an iron/ironing board and hair dryer the room had my three necessities: a safe, a clock, and a coffee maker. Drawers and closet space are adequate. There was a full length mirror. USA Today is included in your room price. If you bring your computer, high speed internet access is available in the room and is included in the room price. The TV was a flat screen. We didn鈥檛 watch TV so I can鈥檛 comment on picture quality or station selection. The shower spray is adjustable and the water temperature remains constant; the water pressure, however, is unsteady. The shower is a shower/bath combination. The bathroom has a nightlight. Housekeeping was dependable, friendly, and performed their duties well. The beds were comfortable. We were on the 11th floor overlooking 8th Avenue; my wife, who is a light sleeper, never commented on any street noise.ELEVATORS: Very efficient -- never an unreasonable waitSTAFF: Pleasant, helpful, and accommodating INTERNET ACCESS: If you don鈥檛 have your computer with you, the hotel provides two computers with printers off the lobby. The cost is included in the price of the room. There is a 10-minute time limit before you are logged out -- a good policy that prevents discourteous guests from treating them like their personal machines.SECURITY: I noticed no security cameras in the hallways and elevators. A security guard checks room keys after 9 PM, but no one was checking on Friday/Saturday nights when we went to our room. In any event, the checking of room keys is not very effective. Instead of turning in the plastic key card when one checks out, an ill-intentioned person can retain it and use it to show the key checker when he wishes to access the room areas at night.FOOD: Like all Hampton Inns at which I鈥檝e stayed, the guests have access to a buffet breakfast which is built into the price of the room. Cereal, sausage, eggs/French toast/waffles, yogurt, breads, bagels, pastries, fruit, milk, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea are standard. The breakfast crew does an excellent job restocking. In addition, apples, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea are available at any time in the lobby [as are cookies if you time it right]. When looking at the price of the room, be sure to consider how much money these food features will save you.All-in-all, a well run hotel in a great location which offers you value for your money."

On our last day, we requested late check out as our shuttle was coming just after 2pm. They offered check out at 2pm. I have never stayed at a more accommodating hotel. Not only did they extend our stay, but the room was cleaned while we were out in the morning - on our discharge day. We were able to come back to a clean room to eat lunch and get ready for our departure. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to New York. We stayed at a larger, more expensive hotel on our last visit. The Hampton surpassed that hotel by far. A great place with employees who went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable."

The room was spacious. We were on the 8th Avenue side 10th floor. I would ask for the other side opposite 8th Ave to get a quieter room. The breakfast was very good and the staff worked hard to keep the food items full and the area clean. The location was perfect. We saw the Jersey Boys and the theater was around the corner on 52 st. 2 minute walk. Learn as much as you can about the transportation system.

When I called my credit card to find out that they have made multiple transaction twice. Credit card company asked me to contact the Hampton Inn, When i called them and spoke with the Guest Service Manager, Let me tell you one thing she doesn't know any thing about customer service and doesn't want to listen what I am trying to say, She insisted that she has been working for may years and know how the system works (I am a frequent traveler and know how the things works) the worst part is that she was not listening to me but keep on saying Calm down.Finally I had put her in a conference call with Credit card company and they explained her than she was apologizing. But that doesn't do any good to me, I waisted 4 hours one the phone and had to use my debit card for few transactions.

Took my daughter for her 16th birthday and also my husband and 18 year old son.It was so close to Times Square, we walked there at least twice a day. The subway was just across the street. Very convenient to everything.The first night we noticed a musty smell in the bathroom, asked them to come spray and they did, but next morning it was still there. Asked to move to another room and they accomodated us immediately. We had absolutely no problem with the next room, it was very clean as was the lobby, halls and dining area.For a free breakfast, I was very impressed. Much more than a continental breakfast. Every day there was cereal, muffins, yogurt, fruit, sweet rolls, bagels and biscuits. There was a hot entree, different each day such as french toast sticks, waffles, biscuits and gravy, sausage and eggs. For the number of people that they served each day, I was amazed at how clean an neat the kept it. Never saw food on the floor or all over the counters. It seemed to be field trip central for high schoolers, I guess because of the free breakfast, but even with that many kids, it still was clean and plentiful. There is 24hr a day coffee and hot chocolate.The lobby usually had free apples and cookies while they lasted.Everyone was friendly and helpful. They locked up our bags since we got there before check-in and also kept them the day we checked out, until time to leave for the flight.

There were three of us in our party and the Twin Queen room was plenty big enough for all of us. The staff were very friendly and helpful, really couldn't fault them. We had requested a non-smoking room but found we had been booked into a smoking room when we arrived (not the hotel's fault). The hotel was fully booked as it was Easter weekend so we couldn't be moved so an ioniser was placed in our room each time we went out which solved the problem. The concierge was also very helpful with booking day trips and shuttles to the airport, nothing seemed to be too much trouble.Location wise Times Square, Central Park, Empire State are all within easy walking distance which is great.

"Review_13897","hotel_186","hotel_8788","Mar 24, 2008","Great!!!! Booked this hotel for one night directly through Hilton's website, at a rate of USD 229 ++.This is one of my all time favourite hotels. It is simply a great hotel. I have stayed at many top ends hotels around the world, and even though Hampton would not be able to compete in the same segment as FS or MO, I must say that the unpretentious level of service and the lavish rooms are highly comparable to the snobby service and tired rooms of many of the top luxury hotels.I was checked-in early by a nice receptionist. The doorstaff took care of my luggage. My room was large and modern, it had a great and comfortable bed, sufficient lighting, a large LCD tv, a laptop safe, walk-in closet, a comfortable desk and ergonomical chair, a cosy chair and footrest. The bathroom was large and had a lot of quality amenities. The bathtub was large enough and the water pressure from the shower head were okey (could have been stronger, but not really a problem). I stayed on several hotels in New York during this trip: two nights at the Westin and three nights at the Sheraton Towers. Unfortunately I stayed only one night at the Hampton, because it was my last night in New York. Hampton were way better than the Westin and the Sheraton, both in terms of service/staff friendliness and in terms of room quality/amenities. I was so surprised by this, and I do wish all Hamptons could be like this one. Every staff member were warm, friendly and smiling - those includes the door staff, the elevator staff, the breakfast staff, the front desk staff, the housekeeping staff and so on. They provide a casual and comfortable atmosphere to the hotel. One of the managers called to my room to hear if everything were fine and in order. This usually happens in high end hotels only. I was pleasantly surprised to experience this in a Hampton Inn! There was complientary wireless internet throughout the hotel, complimentary local calls, complimentary coffee/tea/hot chocolate both in the rooms and in the lobby (a very nice feature), complimentary apples, complimentary newspaper delievered to the room and complimentery buffet breakfast. The breakfast was not my style of breakfast - only sweet things like cookies, donuts, cakes....not very healthy. There was a very limited selection of fruits and yoghurt. But it was all complimentary, so I can't complain about it. Starbucks and Subway were just across the street.Great location too!! One block from Times Square.I will return to this hotel anytime!!! Thank you Hampton Inn!!!"
"Review_13898","hotel_186","hotel_6105","Mar 16, 2008","Nice Location This hotel is conveniently located in midtown Manhattan. It is clean, the rooms are small but comfortable. The breakfast which is included is fine. There are a lot of choices in toast, english muffins, and cereal every morning. There was a lot of help cleaning up and replenishing the food. Certainly anyone with kids would appreciate the convenience of having breakfast available in the hotel at no cost. My only minor problem was when I originally booked my room for 4 nights I was charged a higher price than when I went back and checked the price a few days before I arrived. I called the hotel personally and was told my record would be updated. However, upon check in the agent at the desk quoted the original rate and told me they were like an airline and normally do not adjust the price. However, since I had documentation, she honored the lower price. So be careful and check your room price carefully before you arrive and when you book to be sure you are getting the best deal. I saved over $400 by checking the price on the stay."

"Review_13900","hotel_186","hotel_6184","Mar 11, 2008","Another hotel that just gets it I agree with what the others have said and I'll highlight just a few points:- Location. Close enough to Times Square without being trapped amongst its jammed sidewalks. From JFK take the A or E train to the 50th Street Station (plan an hour each way) and you are a block from the hotel.- Bed. Excellent.- Check-in/Check-out. Fast and friendly.As with most other hotels in NYC there is street noise (specifically car honking at ridiculous hours) to contend with and I would request a room away from the street. Unlike like most NYC hotel rooms the ones here are fairly spacious."

It's not fancy but it's a nice Hotel and good value for the money. The check in was quick, the room was big with comfortable beds, the complimentary breakfast (eat early, at least before 8AM to avoid the crowd) had not everything you might want but was perfectly OK and the staff was friendly. The location is great near Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Pak etc. It's even convienent to take a walk to Madison Square Garden. I will probably stay here again if visiting New York City."

Could not beat the price for the location and ammenities!I was greeted with a welcome back and an early check-in to a room at the end of the hall, on a high floor, just as I had requested. My room faced 8th Ave, and to be honest, I was not bothered by street noise at all. I would rather have the 8th ave view too.The staff here are really warm and helpful. They are also professional and friendly. I had a problem with a slow drain, and it was fixed by the time I got back to my room.The rooms are large and comfortable. I used the safe everyday. And I always felt secure, even staying alone here. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to the city!"

There is an excellent pizza place across the street ( I can't remember the name of it). The food at the pizza place is reasonable and delicious. They have a wide variety too. There's also a few fast food places within walking distance if you are eating on a budget or have kids to feed.The staff was very friendly. It's only a five minute walk to all the attractions in Times Square and Broadway. I don't think I would stay anywhere else. You will be very pleased with hotel!!"
"Review_13904","hotel_186","hotel_7002","Mar 6, 2008","wonderful We just recently got back from our wonderful stay in NYC .Firstly i would like to add that i too had reservations for another hotel, which I cancelled due to trip advisor comments on Hampton innThe hotel check in was great we arrived 2 hours early and we got our room right away with no problems at all, the staff was very friendly especially the man who checked our bags. The room was VERY CLEAN especially the bathroom. The entire room was very pleasant the deco was nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. However, you do hear the typical noise from outside which we all found very exciting your in NEW YORK CITY what else do you expect.The breakfast room was a little crowed but we waited a few minutes and a table cleared up, the food was good typical breakfast stuff cereal, bagels, eggs, fruit etc..also the breakfast staff was great. On your last day we wanted to enjoy new york just a little longer, so the hotel kept our bags for us and no extra charge, however the parking guys did charge us extra (half a day) which wasn't so bad. The parking lot is right next door and its about 25$ a day if you want to take your car out to visit they will charge you for it so i would suggest that you park it for your entire stay (taxi or subway) all in all from our experience we didn't stay in the room very long there are to many things to see in new york, but i loved that fact that every night we went to bed we felt safe and comfortablewe are already planning our next trip to new york in the spring, Hampton Inn sounds just about perfect to us..!!!!!additional points1. the hotel location is great just a few blocks from many great place especially time square2. the subway is minutes away, you can buy a metro passes for 7$ which is very practical3. if you travel in February bring warm clothes ( it was cold)4. must see: time square, empire state building, statue of liberty , Brooklyn bridge, Rockefeller center, canal street, little Italy, Chinatown, Soho, the subways, 5th avenue, Central Park..and the list goes on and on !! what a great city :)"
"Review_13905","hotel_186","hotel_8275","Mar 3, 2008","Can't recommend highly enough! Having researched practically every hotel in NYC, eventually opted for the Hampton. The location, cleanliness, staff and accessibility for my elderly father were second to none. My only gripe was a rather patronising Irish female manager we had the misfortune to meet on our very last day. Quite rude to my father, who is over 80 and very hard of hearing, but this is just an aside.Location is 1st class - go out the front door, turn right and 5 mins take you to Times Sq; turn left and 5 mins take you to Central Park. Right in the heart of everything - subway more or less across the street.If you've never had a Margarita cocktail, go across the street to 'Mi Nidito' Mexican restaurant - I guarantee you'll never get a better one - Killer Margaritas!! In short can't recommend highly enough. Hope anyone who reads this review and is influenced by it has as great a time as I had. Only came home yesterday and miss NYC so much already!!"
"Review_13906","hotel_186","hotel_5957","Mar 1, 2008","Excellent service, charming personnel. I chose the Hampton Inn based on comments from TripAdvisor. I even had reservations for another hotel, which I cancelled, and I am completely satisfied with my choice.The rooms and lobbies are nice and recently decorated. The morning breakfast is very abundant and with different choices every morning. The breakfast and the 24/7 free coffee, chocolate and tea service in the lobby help you save some money that you can invest in treating yourself with one of the many shopping options NYC offers (if you are a lady, don't miss Sephora and Century 21).In addition to checking me in three hours before the expected time, they provided a minifridge to the room one one hour after I requested it.I would recommend this hotel to any friend and it will definitely be my choice for my next trip to NYC."

Good restaurants and diners nearby, and don't forget to go to the Heartland Brewery.Rooms are plenty big enough, beds comfy, everything you need is there and there is the added benefit of the buffet breakfast.Staff are ever so helpful at all times.I will definitely be going back - can't wait for my next trip."
"Review_13908","hotel_186","hotel_10286","Feb 25, 2008","Great hotel right in the middle of everything Two moms, with two 14 y/o daughters in tow. We all loved this hotel. It was wonderful from the get-go. We were cheerfully greeted at checkin, were able to get into our room right away at 10:00 am. We were put on the 5th floor, facing 8th...a bit noisy at night, but otherwise a good view.The location of this hotel is exceptional...there is a parking garage right next door, the subway is right at the corner. Good restaurants are a quick walk. And Times Sq is about a 2 min walk! Getting to any of the theaters is no problem at all. The folks at the Hampton Inn were wonderfully helpful when we needed to extend our stay due to weather last week..we had checked in on Thursday, the 21st, for one night only. However, the snow on Friday prevented our driving back to Mass, so we needed to stay another night. The front desk was wonderful about finding us a room. And they were able to honor our AAA rate as well...what a plus. Bell services was great moving our bags around whenever we needed.The complimentary breakfast was good...everyone in our group was able to find something to eat. The always at hand beverage station off to the side of the lobby got a lot of use from us..lots of coffee and hot chocolate was consumed. And mid-afternoon cookies at the front desk..yummy.We found the hotel to be very clean and nicely refurbished. The rooms were much larger than we had anticipated. The beds were incredibly comfortable. This hotel was everything we could have hoped for, and more. We all agreed that this was a hotel that we would all be happy about returning to."

The location was minutes away from Broadway/Times Square. There's a subway station round the corner too. Breakfast was nice, and the 24hour free hot drinks were an added bonus as it was a cold time of year! If you're aorund mid-afternoon early evening they give some tasty free cookies too! (you can now see why kids would love it!).The staff are VERY helpful and friendly (this goes for staff at most places in New York - shops, restaurants, attractions etc).Other general tips for NY itself - subway passes are great value at $24 for a weeks pass, we were there for a week so it worked out well. We walked a lot for the first day or so but it can be tiring so short trips on the subway made it all a lot easier! There's loads to see and do, and all of its easily accessible from Hampton Inn. I'd definitely recommend it and would love to stay there again!"

"Review_13911","hotel_186","hotel_3264","Feb 21, 2008","Oasis in NY On arrival was checked in immediately - don't think the receptionist even looked up as she was dealing with three things all at once - this is not a complaint - found it amusing. Room great, clean, quiet and large. Breakfast was more than adequate, busy some days and quiet on others, but still very good, every member of staff in the breakfast room could not be more helpful. Every member of staff we spoke to were pleasant and helpful. Newpaper hanging on door handle every morning (ex weekend) and hot drinks, fruit and cookies available complimentary in foyer. Location is very central with quite a few bars and eating places nearby, very handy after a long day sightseeing and too tired to walk any further. Hubby had to use laptop daily and on one occasion could not get connected, they sent their IT guy to see him within 5 mins, - good if you have to do a bit if business while away. Hotel will hold your luggage, we tipped on handing it in and tipped on checking it out as it was a different shift, only sorry we did not tip once and then breakfast staff. Don't use Heartland Brewery round the corner - has a 'funny' smell. Great 5 day break in NY and would certainly stay at Hampton Inn again."

Breakfast is a little on the sweet side for european taste. Could've had real bread or omelette or anything not sweet actually... Our room was on 5th floor, facing 8th avenue. You could here the sirens and cars the first night or two, but after that it was just fine. The room was quite roomy, especially as there were four of us. Two fit in the bed just fine. The last night we had a mouse behind the wall I think, but it was the only living creature besides us during our stay :-)I would propably stay here again next time.

"Review_13913","hotel_186","hotel_10266","Feb 11, 2008","Great place to stay Credit where credit's due. My girlfriend and I have just spent 5 nights at the Hampton Inn on our first visit to New York so can speak from experience. Like all of you who read this, I trust TripAdvisor reviews quite a bit and wasn't disappointed here. I'll give you some useful travel advice too.From JFK take the free AirTrain from your terminal to Jamaica station which provides the connection to New York's Subway system. Depending on what you plan to do, either buy a one-way ticket into the city or buy a $7 Metrocard which allows you unlimited travel on the subway and buses all day. (Subway's easier and doesn't suffer from traffic jams). Take an 'E' train and get off at 50th Street (this takes about 25 minutes), surface onto 8th Avenue, get your bearings and you'll see the awning of the hotel about a minute's walk away at 51st. What could be easier? Check-in was a breeze and we paid the bellman $1 per bag (50p in the UK) to escort us to our room on the 7th floor. I'd asked for a quiet room at the time of booking (on Expedia) and we were given a room at the rear of the building away from the yellow taxi horns and firetruck claxons. If you want that noise, ask for a room at the front! The room had two queen size beds, was clean, air-conditioned and spacious. TV and coffee percolator were present, and the bathroom was fine. Candid pictures elsewhere in these reviews show the rooms well. Complimentary toiletries and towels were provided and replaced every day so you can leave those bits at home. A free safe is also provided in the room. The lobby does indeed have complimentary coffee/tea/hot chocolate available and was very welcome coming in from the cold. The complimentary breakfast with our booking (search around until you get this in the deal) was excellent and set us up for the first part of the day. There's also a small fitness room for those of you who have any energy left in NY. Staff were polite and very helpful. The Hampton Inn is situated about 10 minutes' walk from Times Square and very close to all the theatres. Don't prebook your tickets for Broadway musicals on the internet, but go to the ticket booth on 46th Street at 3pm to buy unsold tickets for that evening's performances. Be prepared to queue a bit, but we got 2 tickets fot Mamma Mia for $121 (about 拢30 each - a steal). I hope this review helps. If you want a clean, reasonably priced and well-located place to lay your head at night, I recommend the Hampton Inn. You could pay more (and less) to stay in NY, but this hotel 'does what it says on the tin'."
"Review_13914","hotel_186","hotel_1552","Feb 11, 2008","Great service Hamptons inns are quicky becoming a favourite of mine for hassle free cheap but above average hotels and this was no exception.The rooms are actually larger than most other NYC hotels i ahve stayed in, well appointed, clean and comfy.The location is good with the parking next to it (2 days in NYC for $50!). While we had a problem with our heating (it only blew cold air we realised after we had come in late evening), room service brought up a space heater fan that was OK (it was 18F outside...). What impressed me most was the desk manager John's attitude towards the whole thing - he was polite, apologised and (in line with thier policy) offered a full refund - without me even having to push the topic as other hotels make you do before they even think about helping.While the heating wasn't a great experience, the service and the standard of the rest of the hotels means i definately will book back in on my next trip to NYC."

The Hampton Inn was among several hotels suggested by the AMA. This Hampton Inn included, as most do a wonderful breakfast, with an on-the-go option, a small, but adequate aerobic exercise area and courteous staff. When traveling on the company dime, anything you can get included in your room amenities equates to added value for procurement - in short, they had me at free wi-fi, a still frequently charged for service.Still, the Hampton Inn was by no means a business class-only hotel. Many travelers were on shopping and sightseeing packages. A few seem to have chosen the Hampton Inn because it is part of the Hilton family. I signed up for Hilton Honors and it is noted on my folio, but I still have yet to get credit for my stay (5 nights). The front desk staff, though hospitable was difficult to access from my room phone. They were constantly busy and the hotel operator, if separate from the concierge, could never reach the front desk for me either. Most of the time, I suspect my inquiries went unfulfilled in exchange for the guest who was physically present at the desk. I paid on average $175.00/day through my AMA discount. This made the Hampton Inn well worth it despite the inconveniences. Near Hell's Kitchen and the Theater District, you are only steps away from a great pub or a nice show. I was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness, quality bed, and modern furniture/linens/decor."
"Review_13916","hotel_186","hotel_10227","Feb 5, 2008","Quite Pleased Maybe my expectations for a New York hotel were too low, but the Hampton Inn really impressed me. While the room wasn't incredibly spacious, I found it quite large for (what I expected of) New York City. The furnishings were nice, and the room was very clean. While others have stated the perks, I'll reinforce some of them: free internet (our room had wired and wireless), free coffee/tea (24/7), a nice breakfast spread (and breakfast-to-go on the weekdays!), and free apples (random, but nice). I took the Amtrak into town, and the hotel was only a $6 cab ride away from Penn Station.More importantly, however, I found the staff to be incredibly helpful. Each staff member seemed to enjoy their work, and they were incredibly helpful on several occasions.This was my first New York hotel stay, and I was wary of the accommodations. However, I was ultimately quite pleased with the Hampton. I will definitely stay there again."

City noise isn't the problem. It is noise from other rooms through what must be very thin walls. You can hear every move your neighbours make. The room doors are also designed to close behind you on a spring which means they slam. More noise.

"Review_13920","hotel_186","hotel_10478","Jan 28, 2008","What we expect from a Hampton Inn A nice Hampton Inn. Being at the northern edge of the theater district means this hotel is a little quieter than many. Bathrooms are small but attractive. The 11th floor--the highest level--is a full floor of king, non-smoking rooms. Comfy mattress. Plumbing noise through the walls, but not much else. (The busload of high school kids were housed on the 2nd floor--not sure how noisy that got!) Rooms face either 8th Avenue or an alley with a tall building on the other side. The street side is a little noisier, but better view (not much view tho, when you're only 11 floors up). Everyone who works there who we encountered was pleasant and helpful. In the evening, someone is stationed near the elevator to make sure people going up have a room key.Request a room as high up as possible and away from the ice machine. The included breakfast is available from 6-10am, but from 8:30-10, at least on weekends, the breakfast room is a polite but crowded zoo. Get there early, even if you plan to take your juice and bagel back to your room. We left our bags with the bellhop to hold between check out and the train home. With our AAA rate, the king room was under $200 a night (excluding taxes) on a cold, cold January weekend."

Location is terrific - three avenues over from St Patrick's Cathedral, around the corner from Times Square, handy for theatre, plenty of restaurants, subway across the road, buses running to Central Park West, etc. Accommodation ok - good sized bedroom with comfortable beds, but bathroom very small and on the shabby side. Big plus was free and unlimited broadband access in the room. Nice touches were complimentary breakfast (not gourmet class but quite adequate), and unlimited coffee and apples in the reception area. Only drawback was that soundproofing between the rooms is virtually non-existent. It was only a problem for us on two of the nights - but could have been a serious negative if there were noisy neighbours next door!"

Again, the location was wonderful - close to the theaters, City Sights bus tour. Also, the breakfast buffet served each morning was bountiful with good selections each day. There were also Breakfast on the Go bags available at the front desk if you didn't have time to eat in their dining room. The queen-sized beds were very comfortable, the room was clean and very quiet. If I had to put anything down that was a negative, it would be that the sink was in the bathroom which made it a juggling act to get four women ready in the morning.

I would definetly go back to the Hampton again. It started with a front desk staff that was very friendly and efficient. We arrived early and had to check our bags and the bell man was quick and friendly, gave me a subway map and got me on my way. The breakfast was excellent, good choices, the area was clean and well kept and the staff went out of their way to make breakfast a good start to the day. They walked around when they were free and asked if they could bring you coffee or juice, never had that happen.The room was a decent size, especially for New York, it was clean and was kept clean during our stay. They use plastic cups which I like far better than glass when staying at a hotel, they were individually wrapped which gives a comforting feeling that they are sanitary. Left a note for some extra mouthwash and it was there when I returned. In the evenings the Bellman checked for key cards as additional security measures. That gave us a much more secure feeling.The locacton is excellent, the theaters we went to were right around the corner, the uptown subway is across the street and the downtown subway is just a block away, In addition Broadway is just a block away which gives you some additional subway choices.Checkout was smooth and quick and again the bellman checked our bags and was quick to call a cab for us.Would I stay here again, YES, in A NEW YORK MINUTE. We normally stay in the Times Square area, this is the first time at this hotel but it wont be the last time. I reserved early and the price while higher than most Hampton Inns, it surely competitive for the New York Area. I am sure you can pay more but why would you want to."

Additionally there are some really great restaurants nearby on Ninth Avenue from american diners to trendy eateries. If there is one criticism it would be that there are only two elevators - a VERY minor matter. The added bonus is the complimentary breakfast from 6 am until 10 am. The food was good with a wide choice. We will certainly use this hotel again. It is an ideal hotel to choose, particularly if you have not visited NYC before - this was our first trip and we will be back."

If you are looking for a reasonable, comfortable, approachable place to rest during your stay in NYC then look no further. This Hampton lives up to the chain's commitment to quality. Hampton Inns are admittedly not the place to stay if you are looking for a boutique hotel with a great restaurant. However this hotel is certainly easy to get to, has great beds, is in a fantastic place for tourists and offers breakfast for a price that is fair considering the locale.Getting to the hotel from the airport is easy even when using MTA. The staff is helpful (they will gladly allow you behind the desk to print boarding passes). The breakfast is at a level one would expect for a tourist class hotel. Overall, unless you are extremely style conscious or discerning to the point that dropping $700 a night for luxury is no problem, this hotel should meet your needs."

We could walk to the french quarter, and other attractions.Even when there was a slight issue with the room, the staff took care of us easily, and were very responsive, evening going out of their way to help us out.

I read a few of the reviews prior to staying at the hotel, and some state that the location wasn鈥檛 ideal or close to anything. Well, if you enjoy walking, and exploring what this area has to offer this is perfect! That is exactly what we did. The short walks to the major happenings was what really made this trip enjoyable. When we were done sightseeing, or just enjoying the festive atmosphere, we walked back to our quiet hotel and got the rest we needed for the next day of exploring. The staff was great, one of the desk agents even helped us find a great place to eat鈥? We will definitely be staying here again鈥?"
"Review_13937","hotel_187","hotel_9698","Oct 30, 2008","Not really on the riverfront, but very nice nonetheless A nice surprise. Once you get over the name not being accurate (the Riverfront is quite a walk away--and the hotel is not a highrise, so no views of the water), this proves to be a lovely boutique hotel. Despite not much of a lobby, the room was gorgeous, and clearly just renovated--everything was immaculate. This room was in the old section, and managed to be both historic and sleek. Huge too, could have bowled in there. Beds are great, particularly the duvets, and bathrooms are quite functional and bright. One wall of the room had exposed brick and plantation shutters.Fitness center is limited but free.Location wasn't bad--a few blocks in back of Harrah's casino, and a block from the kind of depressing Riverwalk mall as well as the convention center--but the heart of the French Quarter was about 30 minutes' walk.No pool--a drawback in often-hot and sticky New Orleans.Staff was quite friendly and helpful--kudos on that score.Priceline gave this a 4 star rating--probably a bit overstated--but at $61 a night, what a value!If this is what Wyndham has become, good deal--this hotel is a credit to their brand."

Everyone could not have been nicer or more helpful. It is within walking distance of almost everything. The rooms are big (except the bathrooms). The beds are VERY comfortable and the hotel is quiet. We had breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. We stayed 6 nights and would go back if we visit New Orleans again. We stay in many hotels during the year for leisure travel. I don't usually write a review but this hotel certainly deserves credit for their outstanding service."

We couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay at! We had day activities to attend inside the Convention Center which is right across the street from the hotel. Also across the street is the nice Riverwalk Mall. The beds were so comfortable. My friends and I melted in them every night and we slept like babies! I really enjoyed my stay here! If you are coming to New Orleans and you will be at the Convention Center, this is the best hotel to stay at. It was 4 of us in one room and we were very comfortable. The standard room is a very nice size. Great job to all the hotel personel. You were wonderful and made our stay very comfortable. I would definetly stay at Wyndham again!"
"Review_13941","hotel_187","hotel_6016","Jul 6, 2008","Nice hotel This is a beautiful, classy hotel with polite staff and clean, upscale rooms. It is very convenient to Harrah's and the Convention Center, but it is a little walk to the French Quarter. If you don't like to walk, take a cab to the Quarter. Despite its name, it does not have a great view of the river, and not much is happening at the Riverwalk mall anyway since Katrina. I was a little concerned about the safety of walking from the Quarter to the hotel at night (I'm a former N.O. resident and am very familiar with downtown) but it was fine. Just walk from the Quarter to Harrah's, then to the Harrah's parking lot, then to the hotel in the next block. Hotel parking was $32 a night, so we played for 30 minutes at Harrah's and got 24 hours of parking for free."

There were 3 of us and each one had a different type of room. It was a wonderful stay. I had a historical king. Great room-large enough but very cozy. The bed was prefect and the towels were big and fluffy. The room furniture was in good shape-well appointed. My request for a refrig was granted due to medical needs-no charge (would have cost $15.00 a day if not for medical). The air system worked great-it was in the upper 90's some days. One of the other guests had a corner king (huge room) and the other had a double queen, also a huge room. The staff was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I can't say enough about the housekeeping gal-she was great-all requests were met. After a couple of days it really felt like home. The desk staff and the bell staff were great also. I would not think twice about staying there again!The hotel is 1 block from the convention center, 2 blocks from Harahs, 1 block to the trolley stop at Riverwalk, and only a short walk into the French Quarter. It felt safe most of the time but there are still a lot of buildings that are not open when you walk away from the major areas."

It was convenient to the convention centre where I attended a conference. After 36 hours of travelling from Australia, check in was quick and easy! Our room was spacious and the bed large and comfortable. The bathroom was small but fully stocked of towels and toiletries.The Wyndham is about 15 min walk to the French Quarter but there are well lit streets to walk along or there is a tram stop near the casino. It would have been convenient to have a bar fridge in the room however there are ice machines on every floor. All the staff we had dealings with were all polite and helpful."

The hotel and our room were clean and very comfortable. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. It was altogether a good experience and I would certainly stay there again. The only things keeping me from giving this hotel a 5-star rating were: Rough and thin towels; a charge for local calls; charge for internet access; and limited television stations. We typically stay in mid-range hotels that almost always provide better towels, free local calls and internet, and better TV coverage."
"Review_13945","hotel_187","hotel_2445","Mar 28, 2008","Nice hotel a bit far from main tourist attaractions Just spend four nights at this property. This is my fourth time in New Orleans and first time post-Katrina and with family. We booked by calling the property directly as we needed two rooms and they were running a second room 1/2 off special. The rooms were nicely decorated. The beds had nice and confomfortable linens. The bathrooms are small at this property. The concierge was very nice and friendly. The only thing I think may need improvement is to have the water and coffee supplies replenished each night by housekeeping. However, be aware that parking is 28 per day, plus tax. We spent most of our time walking to the French Quarter for meals, sightseeing, and shopping. However, there is a nice Cajun restaurant and brewery in walking distance. Overall, very nice property. However, I would not stay here again with children. The crime rate in New Orleans is high and I would eliminate walking long distances after dark with shopping bags and kids (obvious tourists)! I do think that common sense prevails, stay in well lit areas and never talk to strangers. I did see the scam ltaking place around the Natchez that is listed in posts here regarding, Where are you shoes? The scam artists actually said they were part of the Natches (riverboat) crew but they obviously were not. Be careful of stuff like that and you will be fine."
"Review_13946","hotel_187","hotel_10012","Mar 21, 2008","Somewhat Deceiving On our way back to Texas after traveling to Biloxi Ms to see our son in the Air Force, we decided we would give New Orleans a try after having not been there in about 15 years. I studied all of the reviews in Trip Advisor and chose the Wyndham somewhat due to having Riverfront in the name. I visualized relaxing in my room while watching activities on the river. When I booked the room, I even told them I wanted a room with a river view. The young lady told me they were completely booked but could give me a Superior King Corner for just a little more and I booked it. When we got to the hotel at around noon and were told that the check in time was not until 3:00, which was ok with us since we were going to go walk in the French Quarter anyway. They asked for my cell number so they could call me when the room was ready. I never got a call and we went back to the hotel assuming they just forgot and found out all of the Superior King Corners were still not ready and they suggested one of our normal rooms on the sixth floor with a great big window and the best view of the River. We were tired and accepted. We got to the room and looked out the window and discovered that we looked out over a parking lot (about a 400 car lot) and on the other side of that was the railroad tracks and then the River Front Mall. The only view of the river was a very small peek through a breezeway of the mall. The hotel is only 6 stories tall and so is the mall. In short, if you are wanting a view of the river....it does not happen at the Wyndham Riverfront. Oh and by the way, when I got my bill it was for the Superior King Corner. If you are not looking for a view, it is actually a nice hotel with very comfortable beds and is very clean."
"Review_13947","hotel_187","hotel_3117","Mar 21, 2008","Fantastic Stay My wife and I just recently stayed at the Wyndham Riverfront in New Orleans and had a great experience. Overall, this is based on our experience with ALL the staff at the Hotel. They provided some of the best, personalized service and attention that we have received. From the doormen, front desk, reception, room service, etc, everyone was friendly and very attentive.When we asked for a room change after arriving, we were upgraded and received a suite (we are Wyndham by Request members).We ordered in breakfast on several occasions and the food and the service was very good.I would recommend the hotel for its location as well. It is near the river in a very clean area close to shopping, the French Quarter, and the casino. We had originally thought we would stay in the French Quarter, but after having gone there, we felt we had made an excellent choice. You're close enough to walk but you are able to get away to a quieter area of New Orleans.By the way, take some of the tours while you are there -- we can recommend the plantation and city tours of the Garden District, French Quarter, and Katrina areas. They truly give you a feel of this area and the information provided (especially about the Katrina impacted areas) is truly impactful."

Had a great time the hotel was beautiful! One key point: ask to be close to the elevator for your room type. The building hallways wind and I was in room 620 and there is one way to the room and one way back to the elevator...long windy hallway that takes you in a circle! Plush beds, clean bathrooms and iron in room! Some of my team stayed in the Embassy around the corner....Wyndahm had better bathrooms and beds than the Embassy-I saw first hand! (And was $50 cheaper!/night!)The front desk staff was nice folks and the bell man was very sweet. They let me leave my bags in the bag storage area ALL day (post check out) to go see the city and tour. Came back to get my bags at 9pm!In house restaurant kinda pricey so did not eat there. Riverwalk is across the street: eateries and shopping! Yeah!Nice location two blocks north of convention center which was where I needed to be all weekend!Highly recommend!"
"Review_13951","hotel_187","hotel_1006","Jan 8, 2008","Classy Hotel Got a good deal on a very nice hotel for an over night stay between back to back cruises. It's at least a 10 to15 minute walk to the French Quarter but we liked everything about the hotel. About 2 or 3 blocks down the street from the hotel we found a good covered parking lot to leave our car for 13 days for $120 total. The lots name is Ampco System Parking and they shuttled us to and from the cruise port for free and the best part was they were wating for us after both cruises just outside where we cleared coustoms."
"Review_13952","hotel_187","hotel_5708","Jan 4, 2008","Great location Checked in on 12/31/07 and out on 1/2/08. We were in town for the Sugar Bowl and decided to stay outside of the French Quarter to avoid some of the craziness of New Year's Eve. Check in was quick and easy. Help with luggage was great and efficient. The hotel is only 6 stories but has a lot of rooms on long corridors. If you don't want to walk a long way, ask for a room close to the elevators. But ice and vending are at the end of the long winding corridor.Beds were very comfortable and the room was clean with nice amenities including coffee and coffee maker. The do not disturb signs are flimsey and tend to fall off of the door handle. Ours disappeared and the maid was knocking on our door too early in the morning on January 1. She graciously left when asked. The housekeeping staff was very pleasant and did a wonderful job.The walls between rooms seem to be a little thin. From 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. we had a crying baby next door. We didn't use room service and didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant. On New Year's Eve it was closed for a private party.The hotel is very close to the Convention Center and the River Walk. Also close to Harrah's Casino if you're up for a little gambling. It is a hike to the French Quarter but you can walk it or easily get a taxi or take very inexpensive public transportation. Felt safe in this area.Close to the Bon Ton Cafe and Mother's restaurants. Both are excellent! Be prepared to wait in a line outside to eat at Mother's -they don't take reservations. Overall I would recommend the hotel. We used Orbitz to book and therefore didn't get our Wyndham by Request amenities. Learned we need to book directly with Wyndham."
"Review_13953","hotel_188","hotel_8053","Dec 23, 2008","Dont stay here if you want quality and a bit of peace This hotel, from the reveiws seemed nice and friendly and the employees could not do enough for you. Well the hotel we stayed in was polar opposite to this. We had booked two rooms, when we arrived, one room was ready and the other was not. We all brought our bags upstairs to the ready room (room 1420)and waited for our room to be ready. This room was on the 14th floor. We soon discovered that the shower clogged when you turned it on, the tv remote was not working and the towels - if you can call them that were no all in the room. When we went down to get our key for our room, we informed the front desk of our issues and they noted them on post-its(they'll never get lost will they!!). We went to our room, only to find that the air-conditioning unit howled when the wind blew, and it was rather windy outside. We asked to be moved. The front desk were not happy with having to do more work and reassign us. We moved to the 11th floor. The knob to the hot tap was about to fall off, we informed the front desk - it was never fixed while we stayed there. Our towels were the same pokey size as the first room on the 14th floor. We decided to stay as we were tired after our journey. The next morning, up bright and early, we discovered that the remote in the first room was still not working, even after a maintenance person had 'fixed it'(we asked three times for it to be fixed before it finally was). We informed the front desk, more post-its. We went to our room and low and behold in room 1110, there was a construction site in progress - the room was totally gutted and all you could see were bare walls. The knocking, drilling and thumping was deafening. This started every morning at 8.00am sharp!! We complained to the front desk - again - they said they were sorry that we were never informed of the construction prior to our moving, but we could have complementary breakfast the following morning to make up. We took it, but to be honest,it hardly makes up for all the inconvenience of the noise, plus the list is getting longer at this point, we really wanted to move. That eveing, i noticed that our sink or toilet were leaking, we reported it the next morning before breakfast. As we approached our room after eating our 'yummie' free breakfast, we noticed that our door was on the latch. We walked into the room, we could not see anyone in the room, The maintenance man returned after 5 minutes. Our room could have been burgled, all our shopping taken and personal posessions could easily have been taken. How did the maintenance person know that we were the real occupants of the room?? - at this point we really lost it with the reception, but they did not really see the implications of leaving a door ajar. The lifts leave a lot to be desired, we used the service lifts at the end of the corridors as they were more reliable and came quicker. On our last day, one of the main lifts was out of order and a large number of people were checking in and out, so you can imagine how tempers were flaring. Breakfast is a rip off, I had a bagel each morning and paid $13.00 without tax for the privilege. Yes, you can have more if you like, but to be honest, the food was not nice and they never had enough hot water on the go! We informed the front desk of all our grievences when we were checking out, they did not seem too pushed to try and win our over. They offered us complementary breakfast if we returned to the hotel in the future. I DONT THINK I'D EVER GO BACK THERE, AND I AM ADVISING YOU TO DO THE SAME! The W Hotel is only around the corner and is much better!!!!"
"Review_13954","hotel_188","hotel_3344","Dec 20, 2008","Very poor value for money! At 拢175 ($306) per night I expected a whole lot more from this hotel. I appreciate that this is New York where prices are as high as the skyscrapers but this hotel fell way short of our expectations and it is not clear to me how it ranked 68th out of the many hotels in New York. I suspect that, as per some previous reviews, if you book through Expedia as we did, you can expect to be assigned to the less favourable rooms.Firstly, on the upside, the location is very good. Central Park, Times Square and the Rockefella all within easy walking distance鈥?but that is true for most hotels in Manhatten! Some might find the inclusion of a fridge and microwave useful, although to us it just took up premium space in the room. And there the pros end really.Downsides include very small rooms, shabby in d茅cor (air conditioning unit installed in window panel, chipped furniture). While sheets and towels were clean enough, my girlfriend almost impaled herself on a sewing needle left on the floor from the previous guests. On the second day our room was not visited by the cleaner at all (again not reflective of the price tag). The shower was a law unto itself in that the temperature could fluctuate wildly which resulted in an amusing array of dancing and yelping from the occupant. The walls provided insufficient sound insulation from both the neighbours and the plumbing! One of the lifts was out of order for the duration of our stay which generally lead to a cramped ride which stopped at most floors (bizarrely whether someone was waiting or not!). Also watch out using the hairdryers fitted in the bathroom鈥?ours started to smoke! One good point however, was that there was a separate hairdryer in the wardrobe. AND OF COURSE NOT FORGETTING EVERYONE鈥橲 FAVOURITE COMPLAINT鈥?NO FREE INTERNET ACCESS!In isolation none of the above rank higher than an annoyance or inconvenience and the hotel serves the basic purpose of a safe refuge in a great location. But as the most expensive hotel we鈥檝e ever stayed in in the US (this includes the Bellagio in Las Vegas and a lot of business travel!) it represents absolutely terrible value for money. I鈥檓 sure, like us, you鈥檒l make the most of it and not let your room affect having a great time in New York (try to be amused by the Fawlty Towers-esk traits)鈥?but we鈥檒l definitely not be returning to this hotel!"

"Review_13956","hotel_188","hotel_4497","Dec 12, 2008","Good value and well located hotel This was my third time in New York and my first staying at the Belvedere, but I would definitely choose to stay there again. The hotel was well located on West 48th Street, about 2 blocks from Times Square. It was in a fairly quiet road yet close to all the action.The room was very spacious and comfortable - we had 4 adults sharing a room and we didn't feel cramped, though the beds aren't huge. We had a small kitchenette with microwave, fridge and coffee maker which was a nice bonus, though it would be better if they provided some cutlery, plates  glasses to go with it.The shower was great, but the bath was one of those weird low ones more suitable for a child!The service at the hotel was excellent, everyone was really friendly and if we had a request, it was actioned immediately. We didn't try the food so I can't comment on it, though I would recommend the little French place for breakfast - turn left out of the hotel and walk to the end of the street, and just across the road (corner of 8th Ave I think). We also had an excellent dinner at Maze by Gordon Ramsay, and at Craftsteak. There is a fantastic dessert place called Max Brenner on Broadway, near Union Square, but be prepared to wait for a table, especially in the evenings. Sunday lunch time wasn't too bad.The only negative comment I would have is about the lifts - they are soooo slow!! Fortunately we were on 5th floor so it wasn't too much of a mission to walk if we needed to, though when we had to leave with our cases, we must have waited about 15 minutes to get in lift! 9 times out of 10 when one did stop on our floor, it was full up with people from above. Otherwise it was an excellent, well priced and very comfortable base for our stay."
"Review_13957","hotel_188","hotel_6083","Dec 11, 2008","Recommended We've just returned from our stay at the Belvedere - there were four of us (female) and we shared a room with 2 doubles to save money. Our room was high up which cut out a lot of noise, and we were in one of the refurbished rooms (we called ahead to request this). Rooms are decent size, the bathroom is scaled for small people but does the trick. Kitchenette was very handy. Rooms were clean, although we had to request extra towels daily - despite being booked in as a room for 4 people. Ditto the coffee. Gym was better than the photos showed.The most impressive thing about the hotel is the location: just a couple of blocks away from Times Square and around the corner from a great little diner called the Olympic - fully recommend breakfast there. Only complaint I could make is that one of the bellboys had a stinking attitude - we tipped him $4 for storing 6 bags and he stood counting it in front of us, looked disgusted and walked off without even opening the door so we could bring them out to the cab.Would stay again."

We stayed on the 7th floor of this hotel and found the location to be excellent- Times Square is a 5-10 minute walk! The staff are really helpful and friendly and our room was huge with two comfy double beds. The only problem with our room was that it was a bit cold but we contacted the front desk and within half an hour a heater and two extra cosy blankets were delivered to our room and this soon heated us up. The room was clean and although the decor was a bit old fashioned I have heard this is common in new york hotels. The fridge, microwave and tea maker in the room really made a difference to our stay and we made full use of these facilities! I note on previous reviews that there were a few complaints about the elevators and I have to agree that they are very small inside. We did wait on an elevator on a few occasions but not for too long and i wouldnt let this put me off staying here again or recomending this hotel to friends and family. We will definetly be returning to this hotel on our next visit to NYC."

Hotel staff were friendly and helpful but beware when they ask for your credit card they take out 拢67 per night as security in case you use any of there facilities. I got a call from my bank telling me they had withdrawn this amount. I have only just got back and as of yet it has not been repaid although i,m sure it will at some point. I can only comment on my experience but my bathroom was clean and nice but the shower was releaising only cold water on the first day. They will change sheets everyday if you ask.

After much research on the net, I booked this hotel and have nothing but praise for it. We stayed in a king deluxe room on the 16th floor. Room 1614, it was very spacious and the bed was huge! The room was cleaned and we got fresh towels daily. Breakfast was delicious. The location is great, just a few minutes walk to Time Square. I cannot fault this hotel at all and I will definitely stay there again."

Whilst the location of this hotel is excellent and it seems good value, you need to be aware that some rooms are newly renovated whereas some are old and tired.We booked a deluxe double/double room on Expedia. When we arrived, the room was old and in a poor state of repair. We slept in the room one night - but my wife found it unbearable: noisy, damp and very cold (it was an end room on the 3rd floor - 327 I think).We complained the next morning and were offered a free upgrade to a renovated room - at this point the lady on the front desk explained that the Belvedere has some old and some renovated rooms. In fact, we further upgraded to an Executive double on the 15th floor (1505). There was no comparison - it was like being in a different hotel!On another point, I thought the breakfasts were poor: not much choice and not good quality. We ate out in delis instead."

"Review_13968","hotel_188","hotel_6436","Oct 28, 2008","Enjoyed Belvedere in NYC A friend and I spent 4 nights at the Belvedere Hotel in NYC. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at about 1 pm, that our room was ready even though check-in was 4 pm. The room was on the 9th floor and was toawrds the back of the building, but we still had a decent view. The room wa larger than we thought it would be. It also had a refrigerator which we weren't expecting. Positive things about the hotel was that it was clean and well-positioned for going to Broadway shows (it's to the west of Broadway, but so were all the theaters we went to). We found the staff friendly. It was in easy walking distance of Times Square. We had no problems walking to and from the hotel late at night. The hotel was also positioned close to 9th street where there was very nice ethnic resturants for reasonable prices. The hotel had a good American style breakfast - pricey but filling. One other positive - the window in the room opened - so that we didn't get overheated. Even though we were close to a fire station, the traffic noise was minimum. The less than positives were the TV kept going on the blitz, despite our complaints about it. (They did attempt to fix it and by our last day it was working.) The elevators were all small and at busy times, seemed to take a long time (we were on the 9th floor). The hotel was pricey but lower than other hotels we stayed at. Also we made a mistake of not booking early enough. I am going to recommend this hotel to friends that are going to NYC later in the Nov. This is a good hotel for a tourists interested in a going to Broadway shows."

The Belvedere is within a 5 min walk to times square as well as a short walk to Rockefeller Center, Central park, David lettermen show (ed sullivan theater) and the Empire state building. We always felt safe in and around the city (Lots of Police everywhere) The Staff at the hotel seemed nice enough but the room we had was an older room on the 8th floor and not re-furbished! The room was clean but definitely needed to be updated! The bed's (two doubles) were ok, good enough to sleep on. The safe in the closet had no handle so it was a pain in the [----] trying to open! The tub and the sink liked to back up when in use so its more like a shower and a bath at the same time? We had no problems with elevators!! So nothing to serious! But we didn't spend much time in the room! There is so much to see and do in the city that you will only need the room to shower and sleep! I read other reviews and tried the oylimpic restaruant around the corner for breakfast. Its not bad! I guess for the price we payed for the room it was a good deal..? I suggest doing your homework and compare rates at other hotels in the area first!Matt Toronto, Canada"

We walked easily to the theatre, Times Square and the HoHo bus just around the corner. We had a lift just by our door so very convenient. The concierge was very helpful and booked our tours.

What they don't mention is they put a hold of $300 on your credit card untill you check out. This is NOT explained on check in and on their website. I needed this money on my card and they would not release the funds. I asked them what shall i do for money and i quote one of the managers comments  can you play music? as you could busk!!!!! No customer service when asked about changing room was told you got a good rate so thats why you got an older room. Do not stay at this hotel. The location is worth one * alone."

"Review_13976","hotel_188","hotel_3889","Oct 18, 2008","Beware of the Belvedere! Our September, 2008 stay was truly one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory. Please note that the website photos do not match the actual rooms you will be receiving when you check in, unless you have asked for a completely renovated room which will cost substantially more than the advertised prices. The room you will receive, as did my wife and I, and all of the other convention participants who booked here with us, will be classified as a partially renovated room by the staff. This means that it will be dirty, with stained carpeting in need of stretching ( a definite tripping hazard), peeling wallpaper, mildew and mold on almost all bathroom surfaces, no view (ours was of a tenement building across the alley), and the overwhelming pungent smell of industrial strength room freshener which will permeate all of your clothes and your luggage. When we were there we attempted to complain about our room, but the staff, who was obviously used to dissatisfied customers, refused to re-assign a different room to us, and did not even come upstairs to inspect the room after we made our complaints known. The front desk manager, Julio, was the rudest manager we have ever encountered, unwilling to act on any of our complaints or the multiple complaints of other guests with similar problems. The other front desk staff quietly apologized to us when Julio abruptly removed himself from the situation to take an important phone call--the front desk staff seemed overwhelmed with the continous stream of complaining guests. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel in the United States. The room furniture was broken, scratched and looked as if it were purchased from the Salvation Army resale shop. The air conditioners were small dirty units which did not operate properly unless you tied back the rubberized curtain to enable airflow. The vents of the air conditioner were filthy, with dirt and dust overflowing the filter area onto the front control panel. The kitchenette featured prominently on their website was nothing more than a corner of a long, dark hallway with a dirty dormitory refrigerator and a cheap microwave oven perched on a flimsy countertop. The elevators were not functioning for half of our four day stay, forcing us to share the service elevator with the staff; we were stuck in one of the elevator for several minutes when it suddenly stopped. If you are able to change your reservations and stay elsewhere, definitely do! There are several better hotels immediately surrounding this one, including a Courtyard Inn, a Marriott, a Westin, etc. I am sure that they have higher standards for their operations and take their responsibilities with respect to customer satisfaction seriously."

Booked directly from the hotel's site after comparing rates with other travel sites. Pros: * Excellent staff - we arrived at 2pm and were able to check in (regular check in time is 4pm). Very courteous, always with smiles, and pleasant* Location is convenient to a lot of attractions. * Great service - after we checked out the next day we went on a booked tour. We were able to leave our luggage there until mid afternoon. Free service.The room we got are good sized with two beds. The shower head looked like it needed some cleaning so we called before heading out. It had been cleaned when we got back in the evening.The elevators were a bit small - 8 people would fit in very snugly. However, we did not find this to be a major issue. Never had to use the service elevators.Did not have meals in the hotel. The choices within 2 blocks were plenty.The 12th floor was closed and we could hear a bit of construction noise when we first checked in. We only stayed for about 5 minutes and headed out so it did not bother us. It was very quiet during the night so no complaints here either.Conclusion: highly recommended for a night on the Broadway."

I booked the room on Placestostay.com and got a pretty good rate ($225). I was worried about having 5 in one room but we didn't get hassled about it. The other reviews of this hotel are spot on. The location cannot be beat! Literally two blocks from time square, about 4 blocks from most of the theatres and about 10 blocks from Central Park. We didn't take one cab ride. A good guide to NYC city blocks is that 20 blocks equal one mile no matter where you are in the city. About the hotel: spacious clean room with refregerator, Friendly front desk staff, good maid service, nice gift shop, helpful concierge. The hotel is on a quiet side street and it is amazing that Time Square is so close. There is a French Restaurant and a Mexican restaurant right down the street. Down two blocks and up one is the Olympia restaurant which is great for breakfast. The only negative is slow elevators but they have three available."

Rooms are a pretty good size, compared to reviews from other hotels in New York, and have the benefit of a small kitchenette with fridge and microwave oven. The hotel was clean and tidy and certainly didn't have a tired feel to it as other reviewers have mentioned. Only downside the lifts as other reviews have mentioned, we have stayed here before on the third floor so the lifts weren't really a problem. This time however we were on the eighth floor and really had some wait as one of the lifts was out of order, yes use the lifts at the end of the corridors but still be prepared for delays.

From what I understand rooms in New York can be quite small so we was pleasantly surprised. For the price we paid this is great value. If you are looking for pure luxury - look elsewhere. If you are looking for a comfortable 3 star in a good location with pleasant staff and a decent sized, clean and comfortable room then this is what you getOur room was on the 17th floor and had a little kitchenette with coffee maker - coffee suplied - also microwave. The bathroom was small - as other reviewers have said - but it had everything and there was nothing to complain about. Shower was very good.We arrived a little early but our room was ready and we were able to check in. We were also allowed to check out a little later when departing which was great - they held our bags after that.We never had problem with the lifts - probably as we were on the top floor. Once it arrived up it was usually empty - however when it stopped at the various floors on the way down - it was often full. Lifts are definitely small.We had breakfast included in the price and it was very good. It would be very expensive it if were not included. Continental was about $13 and full american was nearly $20. The continental included tea, coffee, breads, cakes, cereal, fruit, cheese etc. The American had in addition suasage, bacon, eggs, home fries, pancakes, french toast. Plently places close by for breakfast otherwise.The location is great and we always felt safe walking around. We ate in the mexican next door one evening - Sombrero - and it was nice. There are plenty bars and restaurants close by and I would definitely stay again - we went to The Social (gets a bit noisy after 5), Hurleys, Pigalle just to name a few.We flew to Newark and got the NJ Transit to Penn - taxi only $8 to hotel. We got a taxi back to airport - hotel porters got it for us - - it was $80 including tip.Would have no hesitation recommending hotel or staying there again"

"Review_13989","hotel_188","hotel_5325","Sep 8, 2008","Hated it! I was looking at reviews of hotels in Chicago and somehow followed a link to a review of the Belvedere in NY. As I read the review I recognized the lobby and rooms from the pictures on line. My mom and I stayed there back in 05 for one night while we were in town to see Mamma Mia. We absolutely HATED the hotel. The location was good, steps away from the Times Square area and an easy walk to the theatre... so if location is of prime concern to you, the Belvedere will do. However... the rooms were ridiculously small and dark, the beds were hard and uncomfortable, the view from the window was the back of the neighbouring buildings. We honestly hated the place, but it served the purpose for our one night in NY. We did travel to NY again in 07 and stayed at the Afffinia - a much better stay, slightly different location (see my review on Affinia). My one caveat is that maybe the Belvedere has upgraded their rooms since 05, but beware...!"
"Review_13990","hotel_188","hotel_2348","Sep 8, 2008","Great Hotel In a nutshell, The Belvedere is a lovely hotel to stay in. Its clean, staff are friendly and helpful. Also, it is a block away from many of the Broadway shows, including the Gershwin Theatre which currently hosts Wicked. Although central to Times Square/Broadway, it is situated on a quite street, away from the hustle of 8th Av. Only slight downside was the lift facilities were a bit sketchy at times but that was usually in the morning time."

We were travelling with two others so booked a room for 4.The room was quite roomy enough for the four of us with luggage - although if the stay were more than two nights we may have had to rethink.The room had two queen beds and a sitting area near the window. That bit of extra room made it very comfortable as we could set up the suitcases over there out of the way.Entrance hall and bathroom near the door meant we heard no noise from the hallway even though we were directly opposite the lifts. Airconditioner was very noisy - my partner ended up wearing noise reducing earphones to block out the noise as it cut in and out.

As mentioned in previous reviews the lifts were very slow but apart from that we had no complaints. The rooms were spacious and clean, staff friendly and helpful, location perfect. What more could you ask for? We didn't eat in the hotel but had breakfast every morning at the 1950's style Olympic Diner (turn left out of the hotel entrance then left again onto 8th Ave - 2min walk). It cost approx $7 for tea, juice and pancakes/waffles.We bought 48hr passes for the hop on, hop off open top bus tour. At $49 well worth it. Stops close to hotel on 8th Ave. Some guides were much better than others.Two most memorable sights were turning into Times Square for the first time and the view from the Empire State Building, both breathtaking.If you get chance would suggest trying BB Kings on 42nd St. to see the Harlem Gospel Choir,($27) they put X-Factor contestants to shame!Also visit the revolving View at the top of the Marriott Hotel Times Square for drinks in the evening. Adults only after 9pm.Those wanting bargins should take a trip to Woodbury Common. It's $40 for the hour long bus trip from the Port Authority Bus Terminal.Fantastic break, looking forward to returning."

( our ages are from 18 to 53 )On the plus side the hotel is in a good location, 5 minutes walk from Times Square.The hotel staff are all courteous  helpful.The reception is very nice.When I looked at the hotel's website it said it had been refurbished in 2007, in fact the refurb started in 2007 and is unfinished. We were put in a small room on the 4th floor, it was shabby, with dirty curtains - very disappointing.There were very few plug points so we had to pull out a chest of drawers and unplug the TV to plug in a hair dryer. There is however a hair dryer on the bathroom wall.There is a filter coffee maker ( coffee is supplied ) with cardboard cups, no spoons, none of the rooms have kettles, so if you want tea you have to heat the water in the microwave.We complained and got moved to a room on the 12th floor which had been refurbished and was more spacious. ( much better )The lifts are quite small and slow.The air con is old and very noisy - so take ear plugs ! To be honest i wouldn't stay at The Belvedere again.Breakfast at the hotel is expensive at $17.95 so take a 2 minute walk to The Pigalle ( turn left out of the hotel, cross at the traffic lights and its on the corner) where they do lovely freshly cooked breakfast/lunch/dinner in traditional old French style surroundings.Lastly I can highly recommend The Big Apple Greeter which is a free service, you can arrange for a native New Yorker to take you on a tour of the city, ours was called Al Riggi, who was fantastic ! He knew NY liike the back of his hand, the history, culture etc we walked for 7 hours and saw so much more than we could have covered ourselves - it was the highlight of the trip !"

I was a bit anxious as I have never been to New York before and especially as I was on my own with my two daughters, although had no cause for concern, the people were always friendly and helpful. The hotel was very pleasant, with breakfast available in the hotel at a very reasonable price, you could also have an evening meal there too, and even phone up for take-away delivery, although we ordered a pizza that never turned up. The down-side we experienced at this hotel, was not being told that they deducted money from your credit card. Having stayed in hotels before, this is the first time that I have actually had money deducted from a card, as they usually take the number for security, which they stated, they did not at any time say that they were going to subtract it from my credit card, which as you can imagine was very inconvenient, and I only found out after contacting my bank. They credit it back after you've checked out, not at all helpful when you actually need the money when you're in the Big Apple!The hotel itself is a good location, near enough to all the action, but far enough away from the expensive parts of nyc.MY TIP: Take blister plasters for all the walking and don't believe that you're comfortable shoes still wont cause you to get some!"

Our room was clean and spacious and I thought it was good value for money. Our room was on the third floor and when we called the elevator it would come from the ground floor and go up all the way to the 17th floor and then get us on the way back down. Most of the time we used the stairs. We were never supplied with sufficient towels and face cloths.We went to the hotel caf茅 for breakfast the next morning. It was $18.99 for all American breakfast and $13.99 for Continental breakfast. It was overpriced and not much to choose from. There was also a hair in the hash browns.One point that really made me angry was the fact that I received two faxes. One was from the Big Apple Greeter which arrived the day before we checked in. The other was about our Niagara Falls Experience pick-up time. I already knew when we were to be picked up. However, the fax was faxed to the hotel on the 11th August and had Urgent written on it. It was for our experience which was on the 12th August. I received the fax on the 16th August. Good job I knew when we were to be picked up!!!That's not all, I actually got charged for this fax. Only one and not both. I complained to one of the receptionists who was very rude and she said that I would have to pay for it. I said that I was not going to pay for someone sending a fax to me, as I didn't ask them to, so why should I pay for it and I mentioned I received it on the 16th August and not the 11th. They said I was given the fax on the 11th August.The receptionist then told me that I didn't have to pay for it but they had my credit card on file. I then asked for it to be taken off the invoice which she told me she was not going to do. I asked for the manager and the manager took of the charge for the fax and updated the invoice. But she did say that they charged people for incoming faxes.All in all I guess our stay at this hotel was OK however, the bellmen seemed to be so overworked they hardly ever opened the door for us."

Just before I began to pull my hair out I was recomended this hotel by a friend who is cabin crew with our national airline. She told me that they would stay there if they were paying for their own stay ( say for a shopping expedition). So on her advise I checked out the website and booked a room that worked out at just under 600 euro for 3 nights. We ended up in an executive room with THE most comfortable bed myself or my partner have ever slept in (it was 6ft sealy). The location was excellent (our room faced onto the original Fame school) with Times Square 2 blocks over and 9th ave having some nice inexpensive restaurants right beside us. The staff were lovely and the room was quite. Hopefully I'll be back in New York in the not so distant future and if so, I'd be overjoyed to stay there again."

This place was a little pricy but very convienynt. The consiare was helpful (when there). So if you are looking for a good location and clean rooms.STAY HERE"

"Review_13999","hotel_188","hotel_8119","Aug 18, 2008","The Belvedere is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!! I booked my room through a training I was attending (American Management Association) and was cautious about the price ($177 - unbeatable in NYC). After reading some of the comments on trip advisor and other sites, I was a little worried about this hotel. However, after a horrible start to our trip (flight got cancelled and we arrived in NYC a day late), we were astounded by the friendliness of the front desk staff. The room we had originally booked was a Double Double in a non-refurbished section of the hotel. When we checked in, the hotel staff immediately upgraded us to an Executive King for a small upgrade fee (which they ended up not even charging us anyways). The room was AMAZING!!! It had marble entryways, a minibar w/ fridge and microwave, and a wall-to-wall marble bath. And the views of NYC from our room were BREATHTAKING!I cannot believe how lucky we got, especially with all the flight troubles. The wonderful staff and accomodations at the Belvedere definitely improved our trip and made it one of the most memorable ever!"

We decided to stay here mainly because of price, location, and the free continental breakfast! In addition, the reviews were excellent.The only negative thing we can say, and everyone else seems to agree, is that the elevators were extremely slow! During the middle of the day, they were fine. But in the morning and evenings, when everyone was coming/going, they were slow!Also, most people commented negatively about the A/C window units, but ours worked like a charm! The room was beautiful!We would DEFINITELY recommend staying here and we will definitely attempt to stay at the Belvedere on our next stay!"
"Review_14001","hotel_188","hotel_2297","Aug 17, 2008","Two thumbs up for The Belvedere! The exceptional location of The Belvedere Hotel is what makes it special. Anything you want to access in Manhattan is easy because of mid-town location. Room was clean, air conditioned, good bed, super rate, and liked having the safe. Front desk staff were friendly and attentive to our needs. All three concierges were most helpful and insightful when we asked about things to do. Can't wait to stay at the Belvedere again. For discounted Broadway tickets, head to lower Manhattan, South Street Seaport booth on Front street. Be there an hour before they open. You won't be disappointed."
"Review_14002","hotel_188","hotel_2219","Aug 17, 2008","Pure qualit and good location We had two days here with our 2 teenagers and I am always concerned about getting 3 star hotels wrong in large cities as they can be mixed in quality and cleanliness, however we were not dissappointed the Belvedere, it was very clean and comforatable ,the staff were friendly and the location was great. I couldnt fault anything about it and would not hesitate to recommend it.The Mexican restuarant nearby whilst looking authentic was just average but handy for the hotel, I wouldnt ttherefore rush back.Having stayed at new york a few times in the past and I know how easy it is to get either the location or indeed the hotel wrong and have in the past taken no chances and paid over the odds for a 4 star chain hotel to ensure it is ok, such as a Marriott. This hotel however is a good value option for a tourist for people not wanting to spend a fortune.I hope this helps."

Like I said, the location was the best part."

While our Executive Double-bed Room was very well-appointed, and with a nice kitchenette, the so called High-Speed/Wireless Internet was NO high speed at all (with 5-10mbph only!!!). This is not something you expect from a nice hotel in NYC. The service was alright except it took two phone calls and an hour later to receive my extra set of towels. Consider its location, the hotel price was a bargain (NYC standard) and I booked it thru the hotel's website."

Power does cut out if you use hair dryer whilst aircon is on. Shower was pretty naff, had to call janitor twice to unblock sink and bath waste pipes. Loo too close to wall at side if you are right handed (get my drift?) Can I heartily recommend Amy's Bread 672 Ninth Avenue (Between 46th  47th Streets) for breakfast? It is an absolute jewel of a place. Turn right out of hotel, then 1st left and walk two blocks. It's on left, blink and you will miss it. It does great coffee, croissants and cakes and sandwiches. Even the French think it is great, they go there in droves. A big bowl of Illy coffee, 2 fresh OJ's, half a baguette each with butter and jam....$13-50. Might sound a lot, but staff there are great, and they know how to make bread etc! Really, really, try it. The laundry next door to Amy's is really good too. Service wash is $8 for up to 10Lb of washing. Get it back after noon if you take it in about 8am. All comes back neatly folded in plastic bag."
"Review_14006","hotel_188","hotel_4663","Aug 6, 2008","Loved the Belvedere We were meeting relatives from Ireland in New York in late July and we all stayed at the Belvedere Hotel. The hotel was within walking distance to Broadway and restaurant row and we were lucky enough to be there during restaurant week! The room was nice with 2 double beds and the beds were comfortable. The room has window AC units which were hard to keep regulated at times. The hallways were not air conditioned but we weren't in the hallways that much. We had children with us and it was hard to get on the elevator with the stroller as the elevator was usually full by the time it got to our floor so we ended up taking the service elevator at the end of the hall. Hotel staff were delightful. We didn't have problems with the hairdryers blow power but the other room did.Check in time is 4pm so if you get there before that you cannot get into your room and will have to wait around the lobby or they will store your luggage and you can go out and do something in the city.The room had a kitchen, fridge, microwave, sink and cabinets so we could bring leftovers back and put in our fridge. The hotel cafe has a delicious breakfast buffet but it is $20.The gift shop is nice too for snacks and tshirts.I would definitely stay at this hotel again."

Stay here if the price is right.Room was very nicely furnished and the bed was comfortable. the room itself was pretty big for a new york hotel room which are notoriously small. The lighting could have been a bit better and there was no full length mirror in the room.The bathroom lacks counter space as it was only a pedestal sink, but the curved shower rod did make the shower feel more spacious. Overall the bathroom was clean and functional and the linens were good quality.The check in staff were friendly and helpful, the concierge was USELESS. I dealt with a few different bellmen, and a few were very helpful, others were not. Tip tip tip tip tip if you want good service. These people want your money and aren't afraid to ask for it or take it."

The reviews were accurate about the small room sizes, but the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Plenty of closet and drawer space. My only issue is the AC. While other reviewers complained of window units, we had a space heater-like unit inside the room that sounded like a volcano every time it went on. Staff not too friendly and are militant about 4 p.m. check-ins. Nice location, seemingly close to everything. Best price we found, but like I said, it came at another price called lack of sleep."
"Review_14009","hotel_188","hotel_8061","Aug 6, 2008","Mixed stay at the Belvedere The hotel is in an ideal location for the sights of New York with Times Sq and Empire States within walking distance. The room was OK but a bit cramp for four of us and also some of the furniture was rather dated and worn. Breakfast was plentiful but we hade to pay for the kids which wasn't mentioned at the time of booking. Worse thing was the a/c in the room which was noisy and on the last night broke down which left the room hot and sticky. The lifts were also a problem as for the size of the hotel there were only two and on three seperate occasions they broke down. Would perhaps stay again but not as good as predicted by many trip advisor reviews."

The hotel was clean and tidy, although our room was a bit small. we had a family room for 4, two adults a 16 yr and a 19 yr old. We had been travelling America and this was our last stop, so we had amassed lots of stuff and there wasnt enough space in the room for all the cases. The one bug bear about the hotel was the lift, it was too small and stopped at every floor!! The staff at the hotel were very helpful, helping us to book a show on Broadway. We would stay here again and if we came as a family would request a bigger room.The internet use in the hotel was expensive but there was a store just down the street that was really cheap internet."
"Review_14011","hotel_188","hotel_7885","Jul 28, 2008","Makes you want to stay out longer! The initial reaction to entering the standard king bed room is this place is old and small. The bathroom takes small to new levels. You can wash your hands while sitting on the toilet. We also had the same problem someone else mentioned about the hair dryer blowing a fuse. But they did have a second hair dryer placed in the closet and that one seemed to do okay. The front desk staff was pleasant, but wouldn't let us check in until 4:00 pm even though I'm sure when we arrived at 3:00 pm rooms were available. The concierge always has a line.The elevators are painfully slow and rather small. What is really frustraing is waiting forever and seeing a full elevator open, having to wait for the next. There is only one ice machine and one soda machine, each located on the second floor.The location is good. But you can do better for your money. Skip the Belvedere."

After the power went out (twice) while blow drying my hair, I was instructed by the operator to not have the air conditioning on while blow drying my hair. Clearly this happens all the time. I'm sure they spend all day taking phone calls from women whose power has gone out. Also, they have the 2 slowest elevators in all of New York City transporting their hundreds of guests (slowly) up to their rooms. I haven't even talked about the bathrooms yet! They're small. When I say small, I mean SMALL. Pedestal sink. Enough said.Oh, and the front desk desk were talking behind our backs when they thought we were out of hearing range. We hadn't even complained about anything! I'm saving that for Tripadvisor. Anyways, there's a million other places to stay in this great city, don't bother with the Belvedere."

"Review_14015","hotel_188","hotel_3326","Jul 13, 2008","Not the greatest The hotel was very convenient to Times Square, but that was pretty much the extent of what I liked about this hotel.The lobby was nice too, but the rooms were very standard and somewhat old.The hallways were hot, as were the elevators.The a/c window unit in the rooms were a pain, because the curtains covered it up.At night we had two choices: 1. Run the a/c and keep the curtains open (couldn't sleep with the light shining in) 2. Run the a/c with the blinds closed, keeping any air from circulating throughout the room (not the best feeling for a summer night).The bathroom was very small, with no where to place your things.There were zero additional pillows or blankets available.Each night we had to ask for additional towels to be brought up to the room.The doorman wouldn't allow me to use the luggage cart when I was checking out, so we had to lug everything down to the lobby ourselves (I could've used his services, but after a few days in NYC I was tipped out).Finally, upon checkout, I was told the valet would bring my car around in 15 minutes, so after the above mentioned trek down to the lobby with all of our stuff, we had the pleasure of waiting in the lobby for over 1 hour for our vehicle.I probably won't be returning to this hotel anytime soon!"
"Review_14016","hotel_188","hotel_9966","Jul 11, 2008","Wonderful Value We've now stayed at 3 similarly priced hotels within 2 blocks of Times Square and the Belvedere was easily the best. It's basics at their best -- very good location on 8thand W48th, decent sized and comfortable rooms, very friendly and helpful staff. The only drawbacks were the 2 slow elevators (but there's a service elevator that no one seems to mind guests using), only ice machine located on 2nd floor, and the long curtains that covered the window-unit air conditioner and blocked air flow into the room. (I rigged something up each night, though, and all was well.) We didn't try the breakfast buffet -- we walked to the corner deli (Green Emporium) or a little bit farther down 8th to the Olympic Cafe. The adjacent fine dining restaurant -- Churrascaria Plataforma -- is an excellent Brazillian steakhouse, but a bit pricey ($140 for the two of us). The Belvedere is a great hotel for the money ... we'll stay there again in a heartbeat. (And be sure to meet the little old lady who lives a couple doors down who runs a hostel ... she's special.)"

The Belevedere provided both of these. It is a wonderful hotel on a quiet street just two blocks from Time Square. The location was perfect. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We stayed in the Executive Double Double suite. The room was a bit small for 2 adults and 2 teenagers but well worth it, the bathroom was large with lots of marble and mirrors. Recommend asking for a room on the street side, upper floor. Great view of the city lights. Sightseeing tours on the Grayline are worth the money. We did the 3 day hop-on/off pass and used it the first 3 days, helped us learn the city and get around to all the sites. China Town/Little Italy are so much fun to shop in - wait to buy your stuff there. Try Carmine's for dinner.We had a great time and loved the city and our hotel! We would stay there again.Jay  Katie - Portland, OR"

Plus, hotel rates have skyrocketed -- the cost of a room at the boutique hotel we stayed in seven years ago has risen from $350/night to $1,400/night. Absurd.Yes, the Belvedere is older and there are window air conditioners. But it was clean, much bigger than we were expecting and because it is an older building, far more sound proof than a chain hotel. We had a fridge/microwave area and a nice closet, too. The lobby area is nice and the staff is friendly. No comp breakfast, though the room had a coffee maker. This property is conveniently located, which is a huge bonus and we felt safe and comfortable here. We paid $184/night via Priceline."

However, The Belvedere was in the mid-price range and had decent reviews compared to some of the others out there.We were impressed from the moment we pulled up. The Bellmen were wonderful and remembered us throughout our stay and always greeted us. The front desk staff was very nice. However, once we got to the room, we were very impressed. We have heard horror stories about small and dirty rooms in New York and we very pleasantly surprised. We booked an Executive Suite and were a bit alarmed when we realized it was right across the hallway from the elevator. However, when we walked into the room, there was nothing to worry about. There is a hallway to the bedrooms so you do not hear any noise at all from the hallway while sleeping. The floors and countertops were all marble and very clean. They replaced the toiletries in the bathroom every day. There was plenty of hot water in the shower and the water pressure was very good.The beds are VERY comfortable and there was also a fridge, sink and microwave which worked out very well for leftovers. The internet was free with this room and we had no problems accessing it. The concierge and front desk were very helpful in assisting us with learning how to use the subway systems (which there a plenty of stations near the hotel). In addition, they recommended a declicious Chinese delivery place.We did eat breakfast in the hotel one morning and it was overpriced for the selection of food. However, the service was great. In addition, there are plenty of great restaurants near the hotel - we really enjoyed a Japanese restaurant across the street. Also, there is a Food Emporium nearby which has great prepared sandwhiches, fruit, pastries, etc. We recommend stopping here to get snacks for the room.We had a nice view of the city as well and the AC worked great. It was nice because it had a remote control so we could control the temperature without getting out of bed.Overall, we had a great experience and we recommend this hotel to anyone!"

The room there was much nicer - with a huge bed and a compact, but nice bathroom.

The grey line bus tours are also good as they give you lots of info about the city and you can hop on and hop off where you like.

We chose sweating the first night and then asked if to move to a room with a blind, which were able to do, otherwise, I would have demanded my money back. The coffee shop doesn't open until 7am, there is no actual restaurant on premises, even though it states there is, it is attached to a Brazilian Steakhouse, but you have to walk around the block to get to it?? I took my mother to NYC for the first time in her life and wanted to be near the touristy attractions, Rock Ctr, Times Sq.etc. I paid over $600 for 2 nights (all other hotels were the same price)and it was a total waste of money.

The location is so central - we walked to Central Park, to the Metropolitian Museum of Art (a long walk), to the Rockefeller Center. There is a nice deli on 9th between 48th and 49th called the Amish Market. Lots of restaurants on 9th. The subways can be confusing at first - the station on 8th and 50th has two entrances - uptown and downtown. If you want to go to Battery Park, go to the subway station on Broadway and 50th. A previous reviewer suggested the elevator at the end of the hall - it is quicker. I would stay there again."

The lobby is nice and clean. We asked for a renovated room, but were told that would be $50 per night extra, so they gave us a refurbished room instead, whatever that means. The room was clean which is a real concern for me, so I was able to relax as needed. I really can't stand a room with dirty ceiling and floors, and this had neither. The bathroom had a little mold around the faucets, and the toilet is so close to the wall that you practically had to sit sideways on it. It was hard to get toilet paper without sliding over a little. I would say the side of it was like 4 inches from the wall, which was very strange. I don't know how a heavyset person could use it at all. The bathtub drained slowly, so you wind up taking a shower with a few inches of water in the tub. The toilet clogged one night, and we called to have it fixed, which was done promptly. The electricity in our room went out when I blow dryed my hair with the air conditioning on, and it took up to 30 minutes to have it restored after calling the front desk. This happened three times. This hotel is in a great location, although a nicer view would have been better, and it was worth saving the money which we used to attend a show. Overall I would stay here again, and I am VERY picky, but if money were not an issue I would stay elsewhere."

Was a bit dubious after reading some of the less favourable reviews, however soon found out that the complaints were unfounded. The room was basic and clean, although the beds were amazingly comfortable. We never ate in the hotel as there are so many places nearby. Someone on trip advisor recommended the deli at the corner of the street that looks like a florists from the outside, we used this as it was cheap and very handy for supplies.The staff were very helpful, we booked the Sex and The City tour through the desk in the hotel and found them reasonably priced and quite obliging.There was a slight issue with having to wait for the lifts, however we just done what everybody else did and used the service elevators at the end of the corridors. The staff didn't mind.As far as we were concerned this was a fab hotel for the price and even more so the location.

We were only pleased about 2 things - the conceirge service and the location. Other than that... were were not impressed! The room was VERY small. The air conditioner was a window unit that was covered by the curtains. So, if you wanted the windows covered by the curtains at night, the air conditioner was covered. The beds were as hard as rocks! We were charged an in room internet fee even though it never worked. We were on the phone for over an hour with the wireless internet help line, and still did not get service but were still charged.. We asked for additional toiletry items which were promised right away: the items never came! My husband was expecting a fax. They told us 2 days in a row that they had not received it, but it was there the entire time. They did not even bother to look for it. We will not stay there again... we did stay at Sklyine hotel for 1 night and were much more impressed with the rooms and service there! and it was cheaper!"

Room is very clean and plenty of towels. Good beds. We stayed on the 7th floor and at the moment of our stay it was not renovated yet. Friends on the 17th floor had a renovated room and it looked very nice! Fridge in the room is very convienent. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, but went to the cafe in the Hilton at the end of the street. Very nice. We will go back to NY and go definitely back to this hotel."
"Review_14034","hotel_188","hotel_5791","Jun 5, 2008","HORRIBLE STAFF My best friend and I went to NY for a pre-christmas vacation and chose the Belvedere from a few hotels that my friend had suggested since they were near her home. The hotel itself was not too bad, the rooms were kind of dungeon-like and small but it wasn't a big deal. It was in a good location, but the thing that trumped EVERYTHING good about the hotel was the AWFUL STAFF!!Basically what happened was we put our bags in storage at the hotel for the day and when we went to claim them, one of them was missing. We asked about it and one of the bell men said he thought he saw another guest grab it from the shelf, and that he thinks he knows who did it. RIGHT. So the hotel staff went over 7 hours of surveillance footage (which they wouldn't let us see) and found that the bell man actually took the bag and blamed it on another guest. He returned the bag to the room discretely. SHADE-BALL! We also saw him get into a fight with a cab driver outside the hotel while we were waiting on a cab, he began yelling racial slurs at him. Very disturbing. To top it all off, the hotel did nothing to accomodate us as far as giving us a discount on our stay, despite that they ruined our entire nights plans and that one of their employees STOLE one of our bags. STUPID, STUPID people. DON'T STAY THERE, they don't care about their guests and they are LIARS."

The location was perfect, staff amazing and the room beautiful. We stayed in an upgraded room for the unlimited internet for my 19 year old daughter, which she used every evening. The room was spacious and the mini kitchen very useful. We did the NY1 deal which included a great buffet breakfast. The rest of the day we just snacked. The hop-on-hop-off bus is just around the corner, if you buy your pass from the office instead of the street guys you get a discount for AAA or CAA. The half price TKTS was a short walk but had huge lineups, so we took the hop-on downtown to South Street Seaport where the line is very short and saw three shows in four days at half price. Would definitely stay there again."

It was reasonably priced and the location couldn't be better. I had some issues checking in, due to a mis-communication with hotels.com, but the front desk was helpful and friendly, and it was quickly sorted out. The room was clean and spacious, and the staff were really accommodating in terms of organizing a later check-out time and holding onto my bags. Would stay here again!"

"Review_14038","hotel_188","hotel_6441","May 28, 2008","Overall Great Stay We just returned from a 5 night stay (May 22-27) booked online via hotels.com. We arrived very late on Thursday night and were greated w/great enthusiasm and courtesy and were in the elevator headed to our room in minutes. We had a regular double on the 8th floor and to echo other's comments, the room was a good size for NYC. The A/C unit worked fabulously (this is important to us!) and also served as white noise from any hallway noise. We might have heard a door near us shut a couple of times and voices in the halllway once or twice, but overall, the soundproofing was great w/the unit on! We slept in until almost 10 a.m. after our late arrival!The staff was excellent. Every single person greeted us, was friendly and willing to help. We easily received a late check-out (1 p.m.) on our last day which was wonderful for being able to go out that last morning and still come back to the hotel to clean up prior to catching a cab to the airport.The bedding is very nice and warm (considering we kept it freezing in the room) and the fridge was a godsend in NYC - having bottles of cold water on hand was fabulous. The bathroom was small, but manageable and we just showered in shifts!The only two issues both regard electricity. After blowing 2 fuses on two different days, I learned the perfect combination of blowing drying my hair in the kitchen area while having both the tv and the a/c unit on. Anything more was too much. I understand the hotel is old (and everything in NY seems to have power issues) so we worked through this, and the staff came immediately to re-set the fuse. The outlet situation is not good for women. There was one extension cord under one bed and in order to use a hair straightener and/or curling iron in front of the dresser/mirror, you had to unplug the nightstand light (and/or clock depending on if you wanted to move it over too) because there were no other outlets. Again, many of the buildings in NY have the same issue so I do not hold this against the hotel at all. The location is super, the staff is fabulous and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again and/or recommend the hotel. Watch websites for deals as we were very lucky to get a 4th night free by continuing to watch for specials."
"Review_14039","hotel_188","hotel_7332","May 27, 2008","Happy Repeat Customer I first stayed at the Belvedere in September 2004, and I was very happy with the room and the service, so I decided to take advantage of a stay 3 nights, get one free deal with hotels.com for a visit to New York with my daughter. We booked a King Executive room, and the hotel website stated that all the King Executive rooms had been renovated. We arrived too early to check-in, but got a call while we were at lunch offering us a queen room that was available immediately. I declined the offer and agreed to wait until a king was available. We arrived back at the hotel at 3:30 and were given a room on the 15th floor facing 48th St. We were very impressed with the renovations; the room looked, and even smelled, brand new. The entryway and bathroom were done in a beautiful brown marble, and the kitchenette area also had a marble countertop. The small fridge was hidden under the sink area, and there was a microwave and coffee maker, but no utensils. The bed had a pillowtop mattress and was very comfortable, and there was a small flat-screen TV on the dresser. There was a large closet with an iron and ironing board, a safe, and a hairdryer in it. Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning the room every day, and we had plenty of Penhaligon products. I guess if I had one complaint, it would be that the towels weren't very soft, but that is minor! The front desk staff and the bellmen were very nice, and there was always someone there to open the door and greet us. They also stored our luggage and hailed a cab for us when we needed one. The location is great - it's close to several subway lines and near Times Square, but the street itself is very quiet. There is a fire station on the corner, but I live near a fire station at home, so I wasn't bothered by sirens at all. There is a 24-hour grocery store on the corner of 48th and 8th where you can buy snacks, drinks, sandwiches, etc. 9th St. has a lot of great restaurants; I recommend Vynl and Eatery, both within a few blocks of the Belvedere. My daughter and I both enjoyed our stay at the Belvedere, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others."
"Review_14040","hotel_188","hotel_9779","May 22, 2008","Great hotel, big rooms We stayed here for 1 night before catching a flight out of JFK. We had a room on the 14th floor and it was great ! The staff were professional and friendly. Check in  check out were a breeze. The room was larger than we expected, especially for NYC, and the king bed was so comfortable !! Lovely light, warm duvets and pillows. The bathroom was small, and the bath/shower took a little while to drain, but it was managable. The room was quiet, even though we were located in front of the elevators. The long corridor between the front door and the bedroom area (with the bathroom and kitchenette located between) blocked any noise from the hallway. Location is fantastic, right near broadway and times square, and only a few blocks from the rockerfeller centre. Highly recommend Trattoria trecolori for dinner, just round the corner on 47th st. Excellent hotel, we would definately stay here again."
"Review_14041","hotel_188","hotel_4883","May 19, 2008","3 nights at the Belvedere We just returned from 3 nights at the Belvedere hotel. I booked on their website and took advantage of the NYC1 package. The breakfast was very good, though I wouldn't want to pay the price for the buffett had it not been included as we are not huge breakfast eaters. As soon as we arrived our luggage was in the hotel before we were out of the cab. Excellent service from the bellman. Check in was quick and easy. They had a room ready for us when we arrived at 12:30pm, but it wasn't what I had wanted so we checked our bags and came back later. I'm still a bit confused as to what rooms were refurbished and which weren't. One person said we had a refurbished room and another said it wasn't. Despite that, we liked the room. We have been in NY several times and this was the largest room we have had. Nice and very comfortable king bed with white down comforter. Room was kept very clean. The bathroom is a bit small but I think that is par for the course. Look at the pictures posted by other travellers when you go to the Belvedere website. They are very good and true to likeness. We liked having the little fridge and microwave. The hotel is in a great area, always remember Hershey's and your street is easy to find. We ate at many of the near by places suggested by others such as Pigaelle's Bistro, Sombrerro's for Mexican, both on 48th and then we ventured to 44th and 6ish? to John's pizzeria. All excellent food. The subway is close and everything is in walking distance.You can't beat the price and it was definitely worth staying at the Belvedere Hotel."
"Review_14042","hotel_188","hotel_8156","May 19, 2008","An Oasis Off Of Times Square If you are looking for a classy, low profile, well maintained and charming room in the mid-town area I don't think you could do any better than The Belvedere. I will qualify that by saying that we stayed in one of the Executive King Rooms on the 15th floor, and it appeared from a few elevator stops, that the hotel is gradually updating all the floors starting from the top down. Consequently, it may be that all the room appointments would not be as lovely as our room. The Executive King is large by NYC standards. The marble bathroom is glorious, great hot water and pressure, toiletries were Pennhaligons which were great. Lots of towels, nice robes. The kitchenette has a coffe pot, cups and coffee provided every day. No plates or utensils are provided. The small refrigerator was fine. The pillow top king size bed was very comfortable. The flat panel TV is not HD, but was fine and had a DVD player. A desk and two night stands, as well as a large closet, hair dryer and iron and ironing board made this room so easy to live out of for our 5 day stay. We had noisy neighbors one night of our stay and the desk responded immediately which was great since it was 3:00 a.m.! The neighboorhood for those who don't know NYC is classic mid-town west side, across the street from P.S. 17 which is the performing arts high school. Tress and apartments, just a step away from restaurant row and the great bistros and bars of 9th avenue. For Chinese try West Side Cottage Too, on 9th and 47th, for Italian you cannot beat Basilica on 9th and 46th. The Amish Market on 9th and 50th is a great grocery for snaks for the room, and hot foods as well. The hotel is within walking distance of most Broadway theatres, and so easy to get to and from on the 1, 9, A, C or E subway lines at 50th. We stay in NYC often, and hate the hustle of Times Square, but come to NYC to see as much theatre as possible. The Belevedere was so quiet and classy as compared to the madness of mid-town, and perfectly placed for a theatre vacation. We will definately stay there again."
"Review_14043","hotel_188","hotel_7689","May 19, 2008","Excellent Location! Stayed four nights at the Belvedere. booked through the hotel's website and availed of the NYC package which included breakfast.

Rooms were great. We had a deluxe double double loads of room for three people. Again just one small negative was that the bathroom could have been bigger. Hairdryer, iron, ironing board supplied. kitchenette was handy with coffee machine. Planning a return trip and wouldnt even bother looking at a different hotel.

"Review_14048","hotel_188","hotel_3545","May 4, 2008","Loved the room but nothing else ! My husband and I stayed here in mid April 2008 following recommendation by friends. We are frequent visitors to New York usually staying on 6th Avenue.The room was beautiful with lovely furniture and small kitchenette area which included fridge and microwave. However the bathroom was absolutely tiny and corridoors quite grubbyStaff were friendly though.Location wise, its at least a 10 -15 minute walk to 5th and 6th Avenue though you have to pass through some pretty dirty/smelly streets. I wouldn't like to do this when it is dark.The fire station is just down the street so its pretty noisy at night !!The buffet breakfast was the worst hotel breakfast I have ever had and was average price for a hotel. orange juice came out of a machine and tasted like it was made from powder and water. Coffee was disgusting. On our 2nd night there about 3 people checked into the room next door at about 2am.soon afterwards lots of others joined them and they began to party ! However the hotel staff dealt with the situation pretty quickly.I realise tha this is something that could occur in any hotel.Though the room was lovely we would not stay here again."

"Review_14050","hotel_188","hotel_1804","May 1, 2008","Good all-rounder This was my second visit to NYC. I chose the Belvedere because it was in a part of town I hadn't stayed before (midtown/theatre district) and because it got a pretty good wrap on Trip Advisor.We stayed in the Belvedere for 7 nights. When we arrived, we were surprised by the size of the room (larger than we were thinking) and the amenities (there was a little kitchen area). The decor/setup of the room was a little dated but this didn't matter - everything work just fine. Plus we were able to get a double room with twin King beds without any problem. The room and bathroom were both clean.Checkin/checkout was about as pleasant as you can get - no queues or issues. A minor gripe - the main bank of elevators was a little slow, but this was circumvented by going to one of the elevators at the end of the corridor.It was the location that really made the stay fantastic. It's a relatively quiet spot (with the mayem of Broadway a short block away) and there are dozens of great restaurants around - I hadn't realised we were going to be right near Hell's Kitchen.So in terms of balancing price/convenience/location/quality, this hit all the targets and I would be happy to stay here on my next trip to NYC."
"Review_14051","hotel_188","hotel_5124","Apr 29, 2008","Convenient hotel for Times Square My friend and I stayed at The Belvedere for three nights. The hotel is so convenient for Times Square, TKTS office (for cheap theatre tickets) and all the major theatres are a couple of blocks away meaning you only have a 5 - 10 minutes walk, Hell's Kitchen, Grayline All Loops bus tours (ticket office just around the corner about two minutes walk away), Rockerfeller Centre, Central Park. The Empire State building and 5th Avenue shopping are about 25 - 30 minutes walk away. We were on the 11th floor facing the front of the hotel. For us, it was high enough not to hear the traffic. The bell hops and doormen were so friendly and couldn't do enough to help you, and the same can be said for the front desk staff, who were friendly, polite and efficient. Make use of the free safety deposit boxes which are accessed via the front desk staff. The room had two double beds (lovely and comfortable, my friend wanted to ship hers back to the UK!). We made use of the fridge in the room, but didn't use the microwave or coffee maker. The only small (very small) criticism was that the bathroom tile grouting had seen better days and could do with freshening up. We would have also liked a full length mirror in the room. We would recommend this hotel if you are on a short break and want to be near the theatre district."

The hotel is in an excellent location just 2 blocks from Times Square and one block to subway stations and a short walk up to Central Park. It was very quiet at night though quite warm in the room and we needed to have the air conditioning on all night. We had a room on the 10th floor which was very clean and comfortable with small kitchen area. Staff were very efficient and quickly attended to any small problems we had. The porters gave excellent local advice as to where to eat etc and were friendly with our children who were very impressed with getting our bags taken out of the taxi and put on a gold trolley and taken up to our room!

We stayed at The Belvedere in March and were a bit worried because of the mixed reviews but it was a lot better than we expected. Initially we were on the 5th floor and because we were at the back of the hotel it was really quiet at night. When a High School Group checked in they were quite noisy so we asked to move and we were put on the 12th floor. The room was fine with nice comfy beds and a decent bathroom.All the staff were really friendly and helpful, particularly Chris the Concierge who had lots of local knowledge.The location of the hotel was great, within walking/subway distance of all main attractions.

It was our first visit to New York and it was everything we could have hoped for and more!! The city has such a buzz and people are so friendly and helpful. I had some reservations about the hotel based on previous reviews but our overall experience of the hotel was extremely positive. Our only complaint was that internet use was very expensive and kept on crashing although the staff were quick to over reimburse credit for future use.The reception staff were welcoming and efficient and allowed us to extend our stay for a late flight. without extra cost. We did not experience any of the problems with the lifts that others have complained about.The location was perfect for Times Square, Broadway and the Theatre District. Our room was very spacious with two queen size beds and a nice bathroom and small kitchenette.We did not have breakfast in the hotel but visited the Pigalle Brasserie on the corner of W48 St/8th Ave and can highly recommed it as previous reviews have done.There was just so much to see and do and not enough time so I am sure I will return in the not too distant future and will return to the Belvedere without reservation."
"Review_14058","hotel_188","hotel_5401","Apr 16, 2008","great hotel I have stayed at this hotel twice previously. Check in was quick and easy. We had a double double room on the 11th floor. Our room was front facing and was quite a bit louder than the rooms ive had previously which were both backwards facing. The school opposite the hotel created quite a bit of noise, however not unbearable noise.This room was definately dated, the safe was broken and i could only open it by sticking my little finger into a small hole and dragging the door open. The radiator leaked and made the carpet a little damp. These were both bearable problems and didnt bother me, but did bother my partner slightly. On our second morning the toilet blocked so we went down to the reception to make them aware of the problems, the lady was very helpful and explained she didnt have a double double available until that evening so we could pack out stuff and put it in storage and then check into the new room later that day. When we explained we didnt need a double double and had only booked one as it had been cheaper on the internet than a king size, she gave us a king room on the 14th floor straight away. We promptly went and threw our belongings in our suitcases and moved rooms. The second room was excellent, the best bed i have ever slept in (i looked forward to going to bed just so i could lay in it) the room was still the same size and was backwards facing so the noise was reduced. We had no further problems and really enjoyed the central location of this hotel.The staff were all friendly and helpful, conceige booked us a town car for our return to the airport. We were very pleased and would not hesitate staying here again."

<Content>not very good Based on our research, we knew that the Belvedere was undergoing renovation. When we exited the elevator and saw the bare conrete floor we should have gone elsewhere but decided to stay. When the drawers to the armoire kept falling onto the floor everytime we tried to use them, we should have left. When we were preparing to go out to dinner and a show, the sound of chisel and hammer removing bathroom tile from the next room made conversation impossible. I contacted management. There was no apology, only the statement that the hotel tried to keep demolition between the hours of 9am and 5pm, when our guests are out and about. I was calling from the room phone so I am pretty sure they knew I was a guest and wasn't out and about. There were some other problems with missed messages and wildly fluctuating water temperatures in the shower that just added to the bad feeling about our stay. I wish that we had stayed elesewhere.The room was kept clean, the elevators not nearly the problem that recent reviews had made it out to be, and the breakfast was good.

<Content>Belvedere Badly Needs a New Heating System I've stayed at the Belvedere a number of times and have always been generally pleased. It is very well located for theater going and considering the very high price of NYC hotels, a good value. However, during my recent stay the heating system was a significant problem. The room had a window air conditioning unit, but no controls at all for the heat. We arrived back late at night and the room was stiffling. We called the front desk and were told someone would be sent to adjust the heat. We couldn't wait up long enough for the workman to arrive and only survived the night by opening the window AND turning on the air conditioner. The next day the heat was turned down and wasn't quite as bad, but we constantly were opening and closing the window and turning on the air conditioner to be comfortable. This hardly made for a great night's sleep.

But the hotel is being renovated in March '08, and it would really be unpleasant to be on a floor they're painting!If you don't book the NY1 package (which includes breakfast), an inexpensive breakfast can be had on 8th Avenue (turn left at the corner) in the deli there.We booked the Belvedere again for our next NY trip.

<Content>I never got my room! I notified the hotel ahead of time that I would be arriving late at night from a flight and they said no problem, your room will be waiting for you. I even called them again when I got into NYC to remind them I would be coming in late. When I arrived at the hotel at 1 am they told me there was a plumbing problem in my room and they didn't have another room to place me in. They told me they went ahead and reserved me a room at a different hotel down the street--when I got there it was a horrible zero star motel that I couldn't even take my shoes off in because it was so dirty! I was very dissappointed in the Belvedere and would never recommend staying there.

<Content>Could not be more central From the time we arrived the staff were very pleasant and couldnot do enough for you. We would reccomend a stay here. Right next to Times Square and a bus stop 50 metres away. Book in advance directly with the hotel to get one of the Special Offers to include breakfast. The breakfast alone will keep you going throughout the day and they encourage you to wrap up some cold meat for a snack later.

<Content>a wonderful little place to stay! I'm not sure how we actually came to find the Belvedere...my sister and I were planning our trip to nyc and probably just googled something or other, found Tripadvisor.com and the Belvedere from there. It had great reviews/ratings, seemed like a fair price for Manhattan and was near to our theatre. We were very pleased with the hotel. We arrived early (before check-in time of 4:00) and had no problem in storing our bags with the bellman while we went out into the stormy/windy afternoon to explore the city. We, btw, had forgotten to pack umbrellas and were able to purchase them at the hotel giftshop which we found to be wellstocked and reasonably priced. We had a newly renovated double, double on the 14th floor I think, facing the street in front and found it to be very quiet. The rooms were a good size, included a kitchenette and were clean and maintained daily in a timely manner...just to show the quick service a bit, we noticed the drain in the tub was a bit slow/clogged our first morning and left a note, asking if they could please check into it for us. It was taken care of by our return to the hotel that evening. All of the hotel staff was very friendly and we really had no problem at all with the elevators or timing of them...the hotel was busy and bustling, but we waited a minute or two at most. I used the basement laundry one day and found it to very clean/bright with up-to-date appliances as well as snack/beverage machines if you were going to be down there for awhile. The hotel was well situated for everything we were doing...we were there the week and didn't take a single nycity cab. Granted, we did put alot of miles on our feet {the best way to get a real feel for the city} and utilized the subway  hop on/off (red ) buses a couple of days as well.It has been several months since our return from nyc and I am sure that I am forgetting some of the finer details of our stay but truly, it was a wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family and would definitely stay again. In fact, we are...in May. Can't wait!! :)

<Content>Comfortable and well situated We stayed at the Belverdere for 4 nights from 14th March and couldn't fault it at all. We were lucky enough to get a free complimentary upgrade on arrival to one of the refurbished rooms at the rear of the hotel - floor 12 - which was comfortable, quiet and spotless, though it was rather warm at night (better than being cold though!). Having the little kitchenette including fridge is a very handy bonus. The newly refurbished bathroom had an excellent over bath shower, with glass door which closed across completely and also had an extractor fan, so there was no build up of steam. The sink surround had ample space for storage too. I think it is a matter of which room you are allocated with this hotel though - reading previous reviews. We had asked to reserve one of the refurbished rooms prior to leaving for our break, but was advised it would be at an additional cost, so we declined and were lucky to be upgraded anyway.The staff were always friendly and helpful and we had no problems at all with the frequency of the lift service. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, prefering to get straight out and about, so can't comment on that. When it came to checking out the friendly Concierge organised our pick up for the airport for us, which was prompt.It was situated really handily for Times Square and even more so for the Greyline (hop on hop off bus) depot, which was just around the corner. Other than the bus trips Uptown and Downtown, we mostly walked everywhere, as it was so central. There was also a litle shop on the corner (with flowers outside - I only say this as we thought at first it was just a florists!) , which was handy for supplies - we bought wine, milk, snacks etc from there.

<Content>2nd visit and still very very good value I'm staying here for a second time and I still think it is good value for NY. The room is very large, not beautiful by European standards, but clean, in good condition, dark wood furniture and light walls, etc. The bathroom is also in good condition and clean with no signs of wear or tear. The room comes equipped with microwave, coffeemaker and fridge! All in very good condition. The hotel is quiet, apart from the occasional excited teenagers in the hallway!The location is also good - there are lots of pleasant bars and restaurants on 8th and 9th avenues, and you can get away from too many tourists!I agree with a previous reviewer that the Internet connection is rubbish in the hotel - they should do something about it! Otherwise, though, a very pleasant place to be!

<Content>Perfect Location We stayed at the Belvedere Hotel for 6 nights and had a great stay:Location - Perfect location, only a couple of blocks (less than 5 minutes walk) from Times Square, also very close to the Rockerfeller Centre.Staff - Very polite, helpful and friendly.Rooms - We were on the 14th Floor, very clean, good size, perfect for a city break.Lifts - Have to echo previous reviews, they are rather slow. Try the lifts at the end of each floor rather than the centre one's, we found these a bit quicker. The only slightly negative thing about or stay but really not too much of an issue.Breakfast - Didn't eat breakfast at the hotel so unable to comment. We really liked 'Pigalle' Brasserie at the end of the road, an excellent way to start the day.In summary, a great stay, will definately stay here again when we return to NY.Not hotel related but The View Restaurant at the Mariott Marquis hotel was a great experience, 360 degree rotating restaurant. Great views of NY whilst eating, brilliant.

<Content>Exceptional Hotel  This has been our second trip to New York and our second time staying in this splendid hotel. What makes this hotel so special is the welcoming atmosphere which greets you from the second the door is opened for you revealing a stunning art deco style lobby and reception area, and the gleaming cleanliness of the whole of this area remains throughout the hotel and our room was cleaned daily to a standard which made us feel we were checking in for the first time!The hotel rooms, well when researching last year so many negative things were mentioned about how New York hotel rooms can be on the small side. OK if price is what dictates and you're not too bothered by this then no problem. But the Belvedere comes with two double beds as standard (in the executive room we stayed in this year easily a third double could have been accommodated), it also has in all rooms a small kitchenette area with floor standing fridge, microwave, coffee maker and safe all for a price booked through Hotels.com which appeared far more reasonable than hotels rooms with less facilities but costing more. The location of this hotel is great. Plenty of restaurants, coffee bars and local stores all within minutes walk as too Times Square, Broadway theatres and bus  subway. We really cannot praise this hotel enough and even if cost was not an issue it would be our only choice of hotel when we return to New York.

<Content>No Problems Check-in to Check-out Recently spent 7 nights at the Belvedere Hotel with my 21-year-old daughter. Overall, we were both very pleased with our stay. The hotel is well located, close to subway and bus stops--just around the corner from the theatre district, on a quiet and safe street.The hotel is well maintained, the lobby spacious and relaxed--you can comfortably hang out and wait with nobody bothering you. The staff is young, friendly and efficient. They routinely and willingly store luggage before check-in or after check-out, if needed. And give you receipts!We booked directly with the hotel's web site and took advantage of their Winter Special rate, which included breakfast. The breakfast caf茅 was attractive and, although the hotel was full, there was always plenty of seating and food. The hot and cold buffet offerings were plentiful and of good quality. But the house coffee was weak. Too bad, otherwise it was perfect--a satisfying way to start the morning and forgo lunch.Our room was on the 14th floor, and supposedly newly renovated. It was spacious, with two comfortable double beds, a desk, TV, chest of drawers, night table, good-sized closet and safe. There was also, near the entry and out of sight of the sleeping area, a kitchenette consisting of a sink, small fridge, microwave oven and coffee maker (if you like your coffee strong, bring your own).The only problems with the room itself were it lacked light and was overheated. The room was lit by two rather old fashioned lamps, no overhead, halogen or spots. There were no individual reading lights next to the beds, but a lamp on the night table in between them, so lights out for one is lights out for all. The room was so warm (in February, below zero, blizzard outside), we needed to put the air conditioner fan on all night and sometimes during the day. No problems with noise from other rooms or the streets below.The bathroom was clean and big enough, but not very modern--think 1960's: tub, shower curtain, fixed showerhead, inadequate lighting. However, there was always plenty of hot water. There was no place to put toiletry bags or a hair dryer (provided) other than on the toilet tank or the floor. And, as there was no exhaust fan, the room filled with steam after a shower. Another thing lacking was a full-length mirror, although there was plenty of space for one on the closet door or in the hallway. We found previous reviewers' complaints about the elevators being slow exagerated. There were no bad surprises with our bill, aside from a suspicious number of charges for local telephone calls. Lastly, A taxi was secured for our departure within seconds of our request.In spite of its minor imperfections, we would not hesitate to return to the Belvedere, as it is a well run hotel, nicely situated in Manhattan and a relatively good deal for New York, particularly if breakfast is complementary.

<Content>Best Four Days of My Life! When me and my best friend stayed here for 3 nights in February, we weren't originally planning on staying here. However, after browsing hotels, we discovered that many hotels required a check-in age of 21. Being 18 and 19 years old, respectively, we looked for a decent hotel that would allow the check-in age to be 18, and found the Belvedere!We arrived at the hotel at about 9 am and the minute we walked in, the bellhops grabbed our bags for us. Although check-in time isn't until 4, we stored our bags there. My parents had cautioned me that there was probably going to be a 5 or 10 dollar charge to storing bags, but that was not the case. We left our bags at the hotel for free, ready to explore the city. The staff had such good advice about where to go to eat, what to do, and the concierge was very knowledgeable about what bus tours to take, etc. Our rooms were an excellent size, the bathroom was lovely, and the best thing was that there was a fridge and microwave so that we could put drinks and other food in there and save a little money. I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel, and if I ever get the chance to return to NYC, I will definitley be staying at the Belvedere hotel once again.

<Content>Short walk to ""Wicked"" There are a lot of hotels in NYC, obviously, and a lot of reviews to check. As reviewed, this seemed like a nice enough hotel. I was fortunate to get a first hand review from a friend, so we booked a room for three for the 2007 Thanksgiving Holiday.Here is the bottom line: We enjoyed this hotel. It was in a perfect location for us, the rooms were clean and, for NYC, spacious, and we liked being able to take leftovers from Manhattan restaurants back to put in the refrigerator in the room.Now, some details: We didn't bother with the restaurant in the hotel. There are too many places to eat nearby that are less expensive.The hotel is just far enough off 8th Ave to be quiet, as these things go. This is especially true if you are on an upper floor in the back.I checked google maps to get directions to Wicked and was happy to see that it was just a few blocks away, as are most Broadway theaters. Wicked was dark that week thanks to the strike, but we went to Spelling Bee which was in the theater adjacent to Wicked. We also walked by the David Letterman/Ed Sullivan Theater, to Columbus Circle for the Macy's Parade, to Central Park, and to Times Square.I had some trouble with the for pay internet in the business center. This service is not provided by the hotel. The company providing this service was very helpful in fixing the problem and refunding my money.The front desk staff were very helpful as well, but we didn't see them very much."
"Review_14060","hotel_188","hotel_5566","Mar 9, 2008","Great Hotel! We booked this hotel as I had stayed here before (albeit 10 years ago!) and found it great then. Its about 3 blocks from Times Square so its quiet when you need the sleep after a hard day's shopping but not so far out that you need to ride the subway to get anywhere. The rooms are very clean, a little small as the beds are huge and very high but a great night's sleep every time. Towels are changed daily. Breakfast is the full American with everything you could want for breakfast there, replaced often and well cooked. We asked for help at the concierge desk in getting to the ferry for the Statue of Liberty, no 1 line from 50th Street goes straight there, the girl was very helpful. The doormen are also very helpful, if there is a restaurant, bar, shop you need, they are the boys to ask and if they dont know it, they know someone who does! All in all a great week, thoroughly recommend this hotel for a decent place to stay in NY. Enjoy!"
"Review_14061","hotel_188","hotel_7847","Mar 8, 2008","Average I stayed in this hotel, August 2007. When I usually go to NYC, I stay in Queens where my family lives. However, this time when I went, I was traveling with my boyfriend. After doing a lot of research, i finally decided on the Belvedere. My three main reasons, were price, location and past reivews.I must say, we were happy to have a kitchenette. I was a selling point for us. The location was central. We were able to walk to fifth ave. times square and to the boat taxi., which took us all around Manhattan. We did breakfast once at the hotel and were not impressed. Also, the wosrse thing about the hotel was the elevators. Not sure if they got them fixed since we were there. They so beyond slow. After walking all day.... and being excited to get back to your room...the fact that the elevators took so long were realy a drag.But all in all, thee hotel was good.. just a bit dated. I would stay there again."
"Review_14062","hotel_188","hotel_6152","Mar 7, 2008","new favorite hotel in theatre district I found this hotel perfect for my needs--good area, large enough room, clean, friendly staff, not ridiculously expensive. I even had a view--which is not often the case in less expensive New York Hotels. I booked an Executive double double and it was nicely renovated, and felt fresh. Perfect for going to plays, taking the subway , and finding good resturants close by."
"Review_14063","hotel_188","hotel_4726","Mar 6, 2008","Good value and good location This is an excellently located Midtown hotel, based between 8th and 9th on W48th st. The rooms are a good size for the category this hotel falls in.If you want a quieter room ask for one at the back of the hotel, you'll avoid the early morning trash collection and kids arriving at the school across the street.Didn't have breakfast in the hotel. Only real gripe was the slow elevators. If you get a good rate then give the hotel a try."
"Review_14064","hotel_188","hotel_7516","Mar 4, 2008","Value for money Hi All, My father and brother and I all stayed in a triple room at the Belvedere from the 24/02/08 - 29/02/08. It was my brother and fathers first time in NYC while I worked in Manhatten and stayed in a number of hotels in the City. The first thing all travellers need to realise is hotels in NY usually have smaller rooms than other cities and offer less value, I guess its a supply and demand thing!I based my bookings on reviews of others and have to say I was not disappointed. I booked the NY special package on the hotels website which undercut all web providers considerably. We got the buffet breakfast for the three of use for an additional 80USD for the five days. The hotel is centrally located and value for money. We requested a refurbished room and an early check in.I had the word games on check in as previous reviewers have noted. I was informed that all rooms had been refurbished and that the newest refurbished rooms were 75 USD extra per night.As our flight from Ireland landed at 11.30 am we were at the hotel at 1.00 pm and were promptly shown to our room on the 14th floor.The room with two double beds was suitable for our use and big enough to accomadate us all. The room was clean although the bathroom fittings were a little outdated. As a regualar visitor to NY this hotel certainly ticked all the boxes for location, cleanliness, staff and price and I would recommend the hotel highly.Enjoy"

"Review_14066","hotel_188","hotel_4795","Mar 3, 2008","Brilliant Hotel, In the one of the best cities in the World! Having stayed here last year and having a brilliant time, myself and my boyfriend didnt hesistate in booking this hotel again. We stayed here for 5 nights this febuary on a bed and breakfast board, and booked via the hotel website. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly, and were quick in e-mail correspondance. The hotel rooms are clean and modern with all amenities available in the room, fridge, coffee maker etc. The breakfast was great, with a large spread of american traditional breakfast, cereals, pastries and much more! A good tasty option to fill you up for your day in the big apple!!!The location of the hotel for me is a big plus for the hotel. Its literally 2 blocks from times square and if your a tourist this is helpful and its easy to get lost. Its also in walking distance of broadway, 5th avenue shopping and broadway. Also close by is the subway. To sum up location its so close to many sights, but far enough so that its not to noisy at night. New York is an amazing city, and i cant wait to return to the city and the hotel already. This hotel offers great value for money with a gorgeous place to rest your feet after all that walking!!!"
"Review_14067","hotel_188","hotel_4478","Mar 3, 2008","Great place to stay for a vacation with your girlfriends! Stayed at the Belvedere in August with 3 of my girlfriends when we went to NYC for vacation. This hotel was perfect in the sense that while you're in NYC you only need a place to crash and take a shower! The room was big enough for all of us, our luggage, and our shopping bags we aquired while there. The staff was great and helpful at all times. THe room we stayed in was a little outdated, but very clean and not noisy at all. Its in a great location...only 2 blocks from Times Square and the subway. THe bathroom was a little small, but that's the only negative I have to say about this place. If you're looking for a resaonably priced, adequdaely sized hotel near all of NYC great attractions, then I highly recommend this place!"
"Review_14068","hotel_188","hotel_8592","Feb 29, 2008","Great Hotel Just got back from The Belvedere and had to share my experience after some of the bad reviews this place has had. Check in/out was quick and the staff were polite, the concierge was knowledgeable and helpful, doormen were attentive and the porters very friendly. Can't complain at all!We had a room on the 16th floor which was spacious for a New York room, clean and well equipped (apart from lack of cutlery in kitchen area but am sure if you ask at reception they would send some up!). The bed was huge and very comfortable. The bathroom was large enough with plenty of towels and a hairdryer. There were some toiletries provided but if you have forgotten yours or they are not adequate there are plenty of Duane Reade's where you can pick some up at no great cost. Being on the 16th floor we did not have a problem with the lifts being full. If you are staying on the middle floors, it would be wise to set off 5 mins early as the lifts may be full when they arrive at your floor and so you may have to wait for one.The hotel is in a great location with plenty of restaurants, bars and shops in the area. We had breakfast every morning at The Olympic Diner just around the corner from the hotel-good selection of breakfast items and cheaper than the hotel. Also recommended is Sombrero-a mexican restaurant a couple of door down from the hotel.Last time I came to New York I stayed at the Four Seasons but would rather stay here next time and save the money to shop with. The rooms are more luxurious at the Four Seasons but when you go to New York you hardly spend anytime in your room as there is so much to see and do."
"Review_14069","hotel_188","hotel_6742","Feb 29, 2008","Better than expected I'd heard that hotel rooms in NYC were generally small, but had read good reviews of the Belvedere and was recommended by a friend so booked a room. I was pleasantly surprised at both the standard and the size of the room.We had two double beds, a well-equipped (but slightly small) bathroom and a small kitchenette area. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Facilities were good and the air-con worked well!The hotel is well-placed within the city and we found some great restaurants on 9th Avenue."
"Review_14070","hotel_188","hotel_3265","Feb 29, 2008","Great Hotel, Great Location! Having looked at many different hotels for our 3 night stay in New York, we decided on The Belvedere having seen the reviews on Trip Advisor.The check in stated was 4pm but we arrived at 12.30pm and got shown to our room straight away. It is a great location on West 48th between 8th and 9th ave. We had a twin room and it was spacious (unlike another NY hotel I stayed in before) with two double beds, bathroom and kitchenette with sink, microwave and coffee maker. Everything you need.The hotel did have a restaurant and room service facilities but we did not use them so I cannot comment. We were on the 3rd floor and unless we opened the window it was not noisy at all.The reception staff were very friendly as were the door men and bell boys everyone made sure we enjoyed our stay. We checked out in the morning but were not flying til the night but they kept our bags for us safely.We had a drink at the bar in the Hudson hotel which i would go to and the W hotel has a couple of good bars Woodbury Common Outlet is great to go to if you love shopping you need to get a bus from the Port Authority at $39 return but there are loads of bargains to be had!We also did the Sex and The City Tour which was $42 each, we diod not book in advance and were lucky to get on as was booked up. It was a good tour though!I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone."

The furniture does need upgraded as does the TV, but it is clean and comfortable and that is most important. Location is fantastic! Subway a block or so away, Olympic Diner around the corner on 8th Ave. wonderful for breakfast. Ask for Gloria if you go. She as been there for years and remembers us year to year.

We had a room at the back of the hotel and never heard any street noise at night. The room was quite big with 2 double beds, fridge and a small half kitchen with kettle etc. The room was clean and the cleaners did a good job keeping it that way every day.

It also is in a relatively quiet part of 48th street. The reception staff, portering staff and concierge were all really helpful and polite and I couldn't fault them. However we found the bedrooms very tired and especially the bathroom which was very dated and the supply of bath products very meagre, ie. one hair shampoo with conditioner between two and one body cream lotion. It was great to have a small kitchen with a microwave and fridge but we had no knives, forks, spoons, plates or dishes of any sort. The only crockery available were mugs and glasses. The corridors were extremely gloomy with very old drab decor but having said that there were workmen about who looked like they may have been applying some paint but we didn't see much evidence of that.The continental breakfast was fine but expensive for what you got.We had a great stay in New York and overall the hotel was ok, just not great. The Mont Blanc restaurant beside the hotel was full of ambience and warmth and we would highly recommend it."
"Review_14075","hotel_188","hotel_2270","Feb 20, 2008","Beauteous Belvedere! Beauteous Belvedere! I stayed in the Belvedere about 4 years ago. Upon check in and reading the reviews here I heard there was some construction going on. We politely asked if we could have a renovated room. Well, we were 鈥渦pgraded鈥?to a suite on the 15th floor. The hotel was sold out too! The room is the same size, maybe a tad bigger but totally renovated. Marble this, flat screen that, attractive linens galore. We heard through the grapevine, that the 15, 16th and 17th floors will be renovated and the rest of the hotel will stay the same. Our room had a view looking out the front of the hotel. It also had a sink outside the bathroom, microwave, and fridge in the hall space. The bathroom is tight, but eye catching. The room space/ bed space was very big and decorated very nicely. The room was occasionally on the warm side, but the thermostat on the wall worked great and cooled us off. Even though it was a Monday and a holiday- President鈥檚 Day, and vacation for many local K-12 students, we only paid $169 AAA rate + tax. I thought this rate was awesome! Most reputable and distinguished hotels were not going for less than $300.00. Now, I ask myself, would I have been happy with a non- renovated room at this price. Well from what I remember, yes. The rooms are very adequate for my needs (overnight stay from CT, a Broadway show and dinner). The staff was very kind and, I would never hesitate recommending this hotel to anyone! I love the location too of this hotel. It鈥檚 a 5 min walk to Time Square, but far enough away to forget about the hustle and bustle. Restaurant Row is right there and there are tons of restaurants/ bars in the area to choose from. You can walk to Central Park and Rockefeller Center. If you are on a budget and don鈥檛 mind the absence of a pool this place will fit your needs. If you are looking for a 5 star experience, I would think elsewhere. Have an awesome trip!"

"Review_14079","hotel_188","hotel_3781","Jan 28, 2008","Other than some word games - no surprises After comparing multiple Theatre District hotels on Tripadvisor, I chose the Belvedere based on the overwhelming good reviews and the price point. I usually use Kayak.com to set a price benchmark, but interestingly enough, the Hotel's own website undercut that price by a good $20/night at $169/night for a one night stay in a King Deluxe room on January 26th.When I called to make the reservation, I asked for a recently remodeled room and the receptionist was very coy about giving me one, saying that they assign rooms at Check in. After a little pressuring by saying that I would just make my reservation elsewhere where they could guarantee a specific room, she said she blocked off a refurbished room for me. A very good - but deceptive - choice of words, as I would find out later.The morning of our departure, I realized that in making my reservation, the receptionist nor I had ever discussed a rate. I had a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach which was substantiated with a call to the hotel to confirm the rate of $169 (plus tax) a night. As it turned out, they had my reservation down as $199/night and I had to talk to a manager to get them to honor their own online rate (he didn't even know about it until he went and checked the website himself). In adddition, I asked the manager about having a renovated room and he said that was $75 MORE a night and went on to say that I had a refurbished room, which apparently means only a few things have been upgraded, including the mattress, linens, etc. Be careful when you book and make sure you are aware of the use of these words by the hotel!Because the rate was still a good one for the area, I kept my reservation and upon arrival, the check in experience was nothing like the experience over the phone. The door was opened by the bellhops and my fiance and I were greeted warmly by everyone in the stylish, clean lobby. There were no surprises at check in and our room was ready within minutes of our arrival.As a side note, the hotel is located in the theater district, but a bit off the beaten path. It's a bit seedy, but it could be much, much worse.As a previous reviewer noted, the elevators were slow, but since were were on the 16th floor, we really didn't mind the wait. The hallway on the 16th floor (as well as any other un-renovated floor) was small, a bit dated, but clean and neutral odor. The room was not as dated as I expected and was very clean. The marble entryway and bathroom was spotless and very inviting. The linens were clean and soft and the view from the 16th floor (room 1603) was actually very nice. One noticeable absence however, was the lack of in-room climate control for heat (there is a window A/C unit for the summer months). Regardless the room was comfortably warm and we regulated the temperature by using the A/C unit's thermostat to keep it at a constant 67-68 degrees.I was a bit disappointed to find that Wi-Fi costs $10 for 24 hours, and they even charge for use of the business center, but I will note that there were at least 4-5 other unsecured wireless signals that my laptop was able to receive - even from the 16th floor.Overall, the experience at the Belveder Hotel was unremarkable, but it did meet expectations for the price paid. You will not be surprised - either negatively or positively, but you will not regret staying here either. Although they have not given me a reason to not try other hotels, they do get a solid recommendation as a reliable, clean stand-by if all else fails. Just make sure you confirm your specific reservation, room type (renovated vs. refurbished) and rate prior to arrival and all will be well.On a side note, Pigalle, the french bistro located a block away is an excellent restaurant. I highly recommend the escargot there - very tasty and done just like I had them in Paris!"
"Review_14080","hotel_188","hotel_3669","Jan 27, 2008","Excellent hotel value in Midtown We stayed at this hotel for one week in early July 2007. We were able to get a good deal for the hotel room from Expedia. We were very pleased with the location and services at this hotel. This high-rise hotel was refurbished a few years ago from its original apartment residence and there are still a few longterm apartment tenants but you would never know it. Our room accomodated two adults and two teenagers without it feeling too cramped for a Manhattan hotel. The washroom and beds were clean and fresh daily. The lobby, surroundings and indoor environment were well maintained, bright and inviting. It has a central location (two blocks from Times Square, near a couple of subway entrances) that allows easy access to all that Manhattan has to offer. Surrounding restaurants within walking distance were plentiful and reasonably priced. The staff were all friendly, pleasant and accomodating. Definitely a real hotel jewel for families in Midtown and we will be back here the next time we visit New York City."
"Review_14081","hotel_188","hotel_1308","Jan 25, 2008","Rooms very nice, BUT... We stayed in a King room on the third floor. It was a recently remodeled room and we were very pleased with the look of the room and the size of it. By New York City standards, it is HUGE! The bed was comfortable with nice linens. However, I would probably not stay there again for several reasons. The worst thing is when you step off the elevator onto your floor you feel like you're in a college dorm. The hallways are narrow and didn't have a fresh smell to them at all. The elevators are very slow and very small -- each time we waited for one on our floor to go to the lobby and the elevator would open, it would be packed with people. Since we were on the third floor we ended up using the steps to get to our room. The worst thing was the noise. The road noise was awful but I realize it's NYC and it's always noisy. The problem is the windows are not very airtight so you could hear everything from the traffic to the kids coming  going to their school across the street. We thought to turn the fan on for some white noise but found that there is no climate control in the room. The people in the room next to us were watching TV till 3 in the morning and we could hear it all. The maids were out in the hallway talking by 9 AM, which woke us up. The bathroom is very nice but could be larger -- there is no place to put toiletries. A shelf would have been very nice. There is a small refrigerator  microwave which is nice, but I would have preferred a much larger bathroom instead. My husband  I had to take turns getting ready. The breakfast buffet was pretty lousy -- nothing special to it at all. After the first day we decided we'd much rather eat breakfast at a NYC deli. So there are pros  cons -- the price was good ($189), the room was very clean and nice, but the noise bothered us enough that we will look for a different place to stay next time we're in the city."

"Review_14086","hotel_188","hotel_9462","Jan 20, 2008","The Jeckle  You don鈥檛 not get a lot of Hotel in NY unless you pay a small fortune. The only good news is that the Belvedere is cheaper than some (but hardly cheap) and the location is very good. Now for the bad news: unfortunately this Hotel has two types of rooms: 鈥楻emodeled鈥?which give you a 4 star experience and 鈥極ld Dirty  Worn Out鈥?rooms which give you a 1 star experience. It appears to be pure chance to which type of room that you are allocated to, as the rates tare he same. Even in the 'new' rooms, the heating and LCD TV does not always work properly. The breakfast in the Hotel caf茅 is very mediocre and very expensive @ $17.95 pp, but is sometimes included as a special off-season deal. (But even if you get it for free, it still does not taste great!)Intrusive building work (the drilling and banging of room remodelling on the 16th floor) was taking place during my stay, very near to my room. They did move me when I complained to a room directly below the noise. I did write a letter of complain to the manager and he/she simply ignored it. Even a simple 'Sorry' would have been nice.You can probably get better standards for your money elsewhere."
"Review_14087","hotel_188","hotel_1008","Jan 17, 2008","Inept for business travelers The Belvedere, which is a clean, relatively modern hotel, should be avoided by business travelers or those needing internet access. First, while they advertise wireless access they only provide it at $9,95 per day. ok. However, it is an unreliable system as each day I have twice not been able to relog on and each time the hotel want to connect me, to technical service in some voice mail jail of a third party provider. After waitng far too long I have demanded a second username and password; which for 2 days they just gave me. Today they refused. They they put someone on the phone who claimed to be the manager . Imagine a manager dealing with a guest's log on issues. This place is definitely mis-managed. So, I finally said I refused to waste my time on their problem, and await technical support as my computer works all over NYC wirelessly and has here also. So, I am finally just accessing the net via my phone and avoiding their poor service. In addition, its only 802.11b and for $9.,95 a day you would expect at least g service. Finally, I will simply share the the sheets are cheap the bed spreads look like my grandmother's and the chair did not fit in front of the desk so the desk was useless. Other than that, so far, and I'm 4 days into a 6 day trip, its been ok. I think I will check out a day early and just never return. I come to NYC every 4 weeks and have found plenty of other more enjoyable places such as Casablanca, Hotel 373, Club Quarters or the Residence Inn all of which accomadated my needs just fine. I just like to try new places which is why I ended up here, but not again."

"Review_14089","hotel_188","hotel_3727","Jan 13, 2008","Fine, just fine We had a pretty uneventful stay. Staff was very nice and accomodating. We were originally in a room on the 8th floor and found it wasn't high enough (in terms of street noise) and they easily moved us to a room on the 14th floor. If you're a light sleeper, I would definitely recommend the highest floors. We had no problems dropping off and the valet parking. Room was a decent size by NY standards and a good location for midtown. The decor could stand a little updating, and especially the hallways which looked a little worn and dreary, but wasn't a big deal. Try the French place right up the street for breakfast.A previous poster mentioned a trip to Woodbury Commons, but it is in New York, not New Jersey - about an hour northwest of the city. A definite must if you have the time.All in all, a positive experience. It's amazing the price of the room and the accommodations (we found a deal at $250-$350 a night), but that's New York for you - nothing is cheap!"
"Review_14090","hotel_188","hotel_6298","Jan 10, 2008","Don't tell our secret The Belevedere is a great little hotel. It was a very last minute trip and we were hoping for a good price. We booked thru Jet Blue website and could only get a double bed room. When we arrived and breezed thru check-in our lovely Desklady asked if that was what we wanted. I asked for a kingsized bed room and was given a very nice corner room with a king on the 14th floor. Small kitchenette with sink, fridge and microwave. Comfortable, clean, quiet with a very friendly staff. Great location. Close to Times Square and all the theatres and restuarant row. Try the Delta Grill on the corner of 48th and 9th. Elevators were fine, just a little warm. Remodeling of 17th floor was no bother. Would most certainly come back again."

Moreover, the hotel was clean and very quiet. What else to ask ?To be recommended for sure!"
"Review_14092","hotel_188","hotel_7348","Jan 6, 2008","Not so great I do not think this hotel deserves the rave reviews that it has received. The rooms are small and mediocre and the service is substandard. First and foremost, the road the hotel was on was closed. This may not seem like a big deal, but in the TImes Square area, it can literally take 45 minutes to go around the block. Therefore, not knowing the road was closed added more than 45 minutes to our trip. In addition, there was no way to drop people or luggage off in front of the hotel. What is most upsetting about this is that the hotel admittedly did nothing to notify its guests when it knew of the road closing at least 24 hours in advance (ie emails or posting notification on its website). We never saw a door man or porter in the hotel. When we upset our frustrations, the management simply stated they we sorry we felt that way.If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive hotel this is okay, but there are much better places at similar rates in NYC"
"Review_14093","hotel_188","hotel_5738","Jan 4, 2008","Great Location for Trade Show  I stay at this hotel whenever I have a trade show in NYC. It's about $5-7 cab fare to the Javits Center. It is close enough to the convention center, and at the same it is near Hell's Kitchen/Times Square. They are a lot of great restaurants around this area, so if you feel tired, you don't need to walk too far to find some great affordable restaurants. There is also a supermarket nearby called Food Emporium. The hotel service is not the best, but it is OK if you don't expect too much service. The rooms are clean and roomy enough for NYC standards. What I like about this hotel is that it has a small kitchenette (microwave, sink, fridge, and a coffee maker)."

"Review_14115","hotel_189","hotel_4926","Dec 23, 2008","Fantastic Hotel All Around I usually stay at Hiltons when I travel for business because of the sheer number of them available; there's a good chance there's a Hilton near the customer I'm traveling to see.This visit, I dragged my husband with me since this month was busy as far as business travel goes and I was tired of being away. (Dragging hubby with me is sort of selfish - it makes the business trip go easier for me) :)What a gorgeous hotel! We stayed at the Hilton Boston Financial District, and being a Hilton Honors member, we received complimentary breakfast coupons for the two days we were there. That was a nice touch.Check-in was mostly hassle-free, though our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we had to wait about an hour and a half. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant CaliTerra to kill time, which ended up being a really nice treat. I had a personal pizza for lunch, while my husband had a grilled turkey panini that he enjoyed. Upon checking in, the room was immaculate. Gorgeous furnishings, impressively-made bed (I love the Hilton Heavenly beds), beautiful bathroom fixtures/decor; this hotel was beautiful all the way around. There was the bed, a nice sitting area with a TV/armoire, and a comfortable chair and desk.Housekeeping offered turn-down service. They freshened your room as well. That's a great touch, to be honest! To see the bed (which is inviting anyway) dressed for you to snuggle deep into the down comforter with the cold weather howling outside ... it's almost irresistible...Room service was actually the best I've had in a hotel anywhere. I had a fantastic spinach tortellini in a cheese sauce, while my husband had a frou-frou pizza, and we split a caesar salad. Frankie the Yankie delivered our food and was so funny to chat with. The kitchen was actually quick to deliver our meal, I was pleasantly surprised.The workout room was beautifully equipped, though the equipment needed a good cleaning. There were three Precor brand treadmills, two Precor brand elliptical runners, and two recumbent-style Precor brand bikes. Each had an entertainment system with headphones so you could either listen to music or watch TV while you worked out. There were also some free weights and a few pieces of universal-style gym equipment. Unfortunately, there was virtually no room to stretch on the floor or do yoga, though there was a yoga mat. There was also no water within the gym; you had to step out of the gym (take your room key with you) to drink from the water fountain outside the gym.The hotel was located a few blocks from the State Street T, so it was a short walk away, though dragging your suitcase through downtown Boston was tough, with the crappy ruddy narrow sidewalks. The State Street T can take you virtually anywhere you need to go so the location was great.I would definitely stay at this hotel again.-Jen"

The front desk agent, Lourdes, was kind  friendly, as were both Concierges....Charles was excellent with directions  a super nice guy! My room (732) had an amazingly comfortable king bed!!---best hotel bed ever--even tops my Four Seasons/Ritz Stays!, nice, roomy bathroom with excellent water pressure  great hot water, as well as La Source Crabtree  Evelyn bath amenties---nice smelling soaps  creams. The room also had very high ceilings, was quite spacious, offered a large desk  roomy closet with robe, iron/board, etc. The lobby is small, but boutique-y,  has two seperate entrances. I had room service for breakfast, which was good, except for a runny egg--as promised, it arrived within 30 minutes to my room (exactly). Christina, the in-room dining order taker, called me after I finished my meal just to make sure everything was well---very nice touch--they never call at luxury properties, so suprised when they called. She was very polite  a pleasure to speak with! The elevators were a little dirty, with some chipped wood (no big deal), but the room was in good shape...the tub looked ever so slightly brown(nothing big enough to call for), but I'm sure that was just usual wear--tear from guests. The lobby had a coffee/tea set-up in the AM, which was also nice. Good location for Fanieul Hall, etc, but about a 20-25 min. walk to Newbury Street, Beacon Hill, etc. Be sure to visit Flour Bakery, Neptune Oyster,  Stephanie's on Newbury..all great places to dine! Boston's street layout is super super confusing, so I was lost quite a bit, so be careful when navigating the city! Warmest Winter Wishes, PW, New York, NY 06 December 2008."

"Review_14119","hotel_189","hotel_4984","Nov 22, 2008","Not the best, but... I wasn't entirely impressed with this Hilton. I stayed here during Greenbuild, a large convention held down at the BCEC. This hotel is located in the financial district, which is convenient to both business and tourist attractions. There are also several pubs on Broad Street (I recommend Mr Dooleys!) and a Panera Bread nearby which are all much more affordable and better food than the restaurant in the hotel.The furnishings are very nice, with granite-topped tables and a comfortable bed. The staff was friendly and helpful, from the check-in desk to the cleaning staff that helped me manuever my large suitcase into the elevator on my way out!However, beyond that, there were several things about my room that made my stay less enjoyable. The heating system did not seem to blow warm air despite much fiddling with the thermostat, and the fan would turn on and off very erratically which woke me up throughout the night. There were two windows in my room which would have been very nice, except that they leaked cold air into the room like a sieve. The heavy drapes worked well at blocking the drafts, but it was still very difficult to keep the room warm (and this was in November!). Thankfully there was a down comforter on the bed! The room itself was pretty small too. Not uncomfortably so, but I had a hard time finding a place to put the luggage rack with my extra-large suitcase on it where it wasn't in the way.The bathroom was large, but there was only one hook for towels in the entire room. I would up having to hang my toiletry kit on the handtowel loop, which was kind of awkward. I also conducted a test of their towel reuse program (I try to do this in every hotel I stay in), and marked one of my towels with make-up before hanging it on the one hook. The next day the towels were folded and put away, and the one I had marked was not there. So much for being green. (Although they did convert to CFL bulbs in all the light fixtures, but the inefficiency of the windows probably negated any energy savings they might have had.)If you are traveling to Boston anytime soon, there may also still be construction on Franklin Street, complete with jackhammers and backhoes starting up at 7 am!Lastly, I would note that the toiletries and soaps provided reminded me of my grandmother... very floral and perfumey, and not pleasant to use.Next time I visit Boston, I will be trying another hotel."
"Review_14120","hotel_189","hotel_9991","Nov 22, 2008","Perfect for a city break This is a large hotel in the heart of Boston's financial district and perfect for roaming the streets of old Boston. Our king bed room was of good size, well appointed and spotlessly clean. The staff were all eager to assist and a refreshing change to some other large city hotels at which we've stayed. One item I should mention; there is no safe in the room. Valuables have to be stored in safe boxes located with the concierge. This is not a problem except for the fact that boxes are limited in size and number. We had a great stay and can recommend this hotel to visitors wanting to see Historic Boston and the walk the Freedom Trail."

I thought the Hilton Financial District would cater to business clients. I found instead that the lower floors of the building are a conference center for Northeast University. As a result, my neighbors on both nights were young adults with noisy enthusiasm commensurate with that age. To the hotel's credit, they responded promptly when I asked them to help tone down the noise after hours. For what I was paying for my room, I wanted a more peaceful stay."

There were 3 of us - two adults and a child and there was plenty of room. All the hotel staff we met were friendly, polite and very helpful. The hotel was really handy for most places in the city - Quincey Market just a 5 minute Walk; Boston Common a 5 minute walk north. We all really loved Boston as it was 'walkable' - we will definitely be back ........and probably to this hotel."
"Review_14125","hotel_189","hotel_8580","Nov 13, 2008","Rooms are not user friendly The hotel is in a nice location and the staff personnel are helpful and friendly. The rooms, however, leave much to be desired. Our room was a spacious double on the 7th floor. Storage space, however, was sparse. There are only a couple of small drawers, none full-sized. There are no hooks in the bathroom, no make-up mirror, and no shelves for cosmetic bags. The oblong wastebaskets are so narrow they can't hold much. The bathroom had a loud low-flow toilet that took forever to fill. The hotel has an exercise room but it is geared toward cardiac machines and lacks a good assortment of exercise equipment, although it does have free weights. It also seems designed for tall men: I couldn't use the chin-up bar because I could barely reach it!We had stayed at 2 other hotels and 1 BB during this trip, including one other Hilton. The rooms in this hotel seem to have been designed for beauty rather than function. We would not stay here again for that reason."

The staff was great. There was a small line at registration but it moved rather quickly.The location was actually pretty quite during the weekend. I'm guessing it's buzzing during the week. It is in walking distance to the metro, waterfront and Faneuil Hall. Which translates to plenty of places to eat, drink and be with friends. It's a quick cab to the theatre district and the public garden but you're better off walking during commute hours. The hotel was clean, the decor in my room was lovely with dental modelings, fine drapes and cherry furniture. The linens was above average.. .that's important to me. I would stay at this location again but it does lack a spa."

I thought it was an unbeatable location. The staff were all pleasant and helpful. The room was wonderfully spacious, so much so that our next Hilton (Chicago) came as a terrible shock. Coming in after a lot of walking on a chilly afternoon, we found the complimentary hot apple cider to be a delightful and much welcomed touch. The room was perfectly clean, with an outsize bathroom. The hotel was quiet, so we got a good sleep. The breakfast was really high-quality ($22 for all you could eat) and dinner was excellent too. I really hope to visit this hotel again."

"Review_14129","hotel_189","hotel_9663","Oct 28, 2008","Worthy of the 4 Star Rating, but if you go, tips to know Great Hotel within walking distance of the North End (Italian [Food] District), Boston Commons (think Central Park), the New England Aquarium, Freedom Trail (Paul Revere's route), and of course, the Ocean.Tips:- Skip the Hotel Restaurant: too many nice less expensive options within a couple blocks. - The Times Irish Pub - good food, very reasonable ($7-$20) - Panera Bread - breakfast egg soufles $4. - Subway (Good for on the run) - Umbria Italian (PIZZA ) Steakhouse (Didn't eat there, but looked pretty fancy.)- Skip the Valet Parking ($38/night): One block North of the Hotel is Valet parking (same place that the Hilton uses!) for cheaper ($18-$34/night).- Don't use the $4.50 Bottled Water (from Italy) in the room, go down to the Hotel Fitness Center for free bottles of Poland Springs (Maine) water.- Don't pay for internet in room! Take your laptop down to the Hotel Library, where Hilton offers complementary wireless through WayPort (or something like that) ISP (for free). Sign up (by going to Google.com, and it will redirect you, follow the prompt), then go up to your room, and the same ISP will let you use it for free until 3PM the following day. (Then just do the same thing again!)- Ask the extremely knowledgeable Concierge questions, and for a local map (The Hilton Map was not touristy, but did give you everything you needed to know about the downtown area.)Enjoy your trip!"

The Hilton really is in a great location, only a short walk to Fanuel Hall, the water front, the North End, the Freedom Trail and the subway.Decent sized room that was quiet and comfortable. The only problem (with a small p) was a missing privacy card however this arrived within 5 minutes of contacting housekeeping.The adjoining restaurant served a suberb (but slightly pricy) breakfast, with staff particularly friendly and attentive.Bottom line - doubt you'll find anywhere better as an all round package."
"Review_14131","hotel_189","hotel_6004","Oct 7, 2008","Great Location, Mediocre Service The Hilton is in a great location. Easy walk to Fanuel Hall, the water front, the North End, the Freedom Trail and the subway. Check-in was convenient. Even though the front desk staff was proficient, it felt insincere. If I spoke Spanish they may have been more personable. They were efficient and polite just enough so you really couldn't complain but you didn't walk away feeling you were a welcome guest either. I am a Hilton Honors Silver member. I asked if that meant anything and it didn't because she didn't offer anything. I asked at the HIlton Boston Airport and got a free upgrade even though I didn't qualify.The hotel room was spacious, the beds very comfortable and the linens nice. If you left the hot water running too long in the shower, the mold on the grout would flake off. Hardly any of the ice machines worked, I had to travel several floors before finding one. The maid staff new there was no ice but obviously didn't report it to management.The A/C was practically non-existent. We called the front desk at 9:00PM to ask for an engineer but one never showed up. The front desk did call and inquire but that was the last of any front desk assistance. We saw the engineer on the elevator in the morning and asked him to check it. The only way we knew he had been there was the thermostat was lower than we left it.In order to use the elevators above floor 4, you need to slide your card. This was not explained at the desk. This hotel was popular with tour buses. Every night, I would find older couples trying to figure out how to get off on their floor. Luckily they were British and Irish and we could communicate. A good example of the lack of customer service.We left a flyer on the door for breakfast the next morning. My traveling companion didn't put the room number on it. The person collecting the cards obviously didn't check for that information. It was that lack of attention that makes this hotel just okay. Luckily we got a corporate rate of $209 a night. If I had paid more, I would have been very disappointed.Even though the hotel was in a great location, I won't return. The service was just mediocre and left me feeling like just another paying customer. If you didn't ask for a service it wasn't offered and if you didn't report a problem, it wasn't addressed. Nothing special."

When I read them, I had expected the hotel to be of the level you might expect of a Ritz or a Four Seasons. It isn't, it is just a very good Hilton, showing all the good things of a high end Hilton and no criticisms but just not a five star hotel.The beds are comfy, the bathrooms great, the service fine. The public areas are limited though, which is partly why I don't belive it is a 5 star hotel.The bar next door, Mr Dooleys, was FANTASTIC!!!

"Review_14144","hotel_189","hotel_8258","Jul 29, 2008","Good location, clean, but spendy! Hotel's lcoation is convenient and close to a lot of things to do. Hotel is in an old buidling with nicely done rooms. The lobby area was small and 'felt' crowded. Though the room was small, the room did contain a King size bed, sitting chair w/Ottoman and business desk. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Even with the expected higher rates of a downtown location, I found the price per night to be expensive for the room I had. With the hotels close proximity to restaurants and its' downtown location, garbage trucks were out in force beginning around 4:30AM emptying the dumpsters in the area. It was quite loud. And beginning around 6AM the food and service delivery trucks for the restaurants began making their deliveries. From the hotel it is a short walk to a variety of restaurants and bars. Also, it is close to Qunicy Market, Faneuil Hall, Old State House and shopping. For something a little different. we took a water taxi to Logan airport instead of regular taxi. The water taxi can be picked up behind the Harbor Place Hotel (about two blocks from the Hilton), rate is $10, and it drops you off on airport property where you can pick up a bus shuttle to the terminal. It provided great views of Boston."

Hotel was very clean and beds were adorned with a down comforter and 6 down pillows! The heavy drapes were very good at keeping out the sunlight which allowed us to sleep in a little longer. There are tons of bars and shops within walking distance including Quincy Market and the waterfront attractions. Subway (T) is a few blocks away and easily accessible.The Concierge was helpful and the Bell hops were on the ball and abundant . The front desk was OK but I never got the warm and fuzzies from them. Room service was quick with a breakfast of fresh berries, muffins and hot coffee. The North End was a fairly short T ride to North Station and a quick walk from there. A must if you like homemeade italian cooking. The whole area feels like a street carnival on a weekend night. Lots of fun.Overall I would definitely stay here again. The only problem we experienced was the constant whirling of the AC unit outside below the window. If you remember, ask for a room away from the hotels AC unit. It's not a huge problem or deal breaker, just more of a nuisance."

The financial district seemed safer than other parts of the city, light traffic. Subway and harbor less than 5 minute walk away, shops and restaurants, bars all around. We skipped the hotel valet parking @ $38 a day and found all-day weekend parking for $9.00 per day, 2 blocks away at the Postal Square garage. We never took the car out for the whole weekend. Never eat at the hotel but breakfast was cheap at the nice Panera Bread 1 block away. Hotel bar nice for an upscale place for a drink.

The unit hummed all night and I regretted not packing a sleep aid! I asked about using a business center to print out my boarding passes. The business center (2 computers and 1 printer) charged a minimum of $10 to get online. If a patron is paying $349 per night, being able to use a business center to print out a boarding pass and check flight status should be free and not at an additional charge.

However, front desk staff was a problem.When I checked in a very rude woman was working the desk. We ended up having an argument over earning HiltonHHonors points. I was tired after a long and frustrating plane ride so I let the matter drop for the moment.Upon my check in the hotel placed a $300 hold on my credit card. I was not told of the hold by the rude font desk clerk so it came as an embarrassing surprise later that night when I tried to use my card to pay for dinner at a local restaurant.I ate dinner in the hotel restaurant the second night. The food and service were just fine, until it came time to pay the bill. I do not like to make charges to my room, so I put my credit card in the bill folder and waited for the server to make the charge. The server never came back; I assume he thought I was going to charge the meal to my room. I ended up having to charge the dinner to my room.Finally, on my last day I decided to make a complaint to the hotel management. The same rude woman from my check in was working the desk with another clerk. The rude woman and the other clerk actually tried to tell me that no manager was available to take my complaint. I held my ground and insisted that I speak with a manager, even if they had to call one from home. No surprise, they were suddenly able to find a manager, who turned out to be the Director of Revenue. I assume that is a fancy title for Sales Manager. The manager was actually very sympathetic and was able to resolve my complaints to my satisfaction.Overall, the hotel was a nice place to stay and I would recommend it to others."

I stayed at this one only to try a new hotel in Boston after the Langham and the Westin Waterfront. This hotel was bland and unexciting. Although the staff do treat you nicely and try to remember your name (appreciated), the room (two doubles) was small and there was no view and did not have a nice hotel feel to it. I suppose it may be too much to ask a downtown hotel. There seemed to be many priceline guests, and so though it is in a business district, the clientele seemed less businesslike.The Langham around the corner had more of an upscale feel to it. Adequate, but I probably would either go back to the Langham or try something else."

The staff was very friendly and efficient. Upgraded one night's stay to a suite for an extra $75 - my husband's birthday. The suite was nice, very spacious, but considering the inconvenience of changing rooms I wouldn't do it again. The non-suite room we moved to for the last two nights of our stay was a very large room so it would have sufficed perfectly. Extremely clean. We spent very little time in the room. I loved the proximity of everything in the Financial District. We bought Trolley tickets but got off at stop 4 and just walked everywhere - and I am not a walker. With our suite upgrade were free tickets to the buffet that they charge $19.95. Do not waste your money on the buffet. The food is unbelievable expensive in the restaurant. There is a Panera Bread just down the road and plenty of little shops to get a bite to eat. Quincy Market, North End all within walking distance.

As it was our engagement celebration, I had asked for a card to be placed in the room for my partner and the staff went out of their way to make our stay special. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were spacious and impecably clean. The breakfast buffet was great, as there were a lot of healthy items as well as the usual pancakes  muffins etc.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues. You are guaranteed to have a stress free stay here."

My room was upgraded to a two-room suite and when I arrived in my room I got a phone call from the front desk asking me if everything was to my liking. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the hotel was close to everything (and easy to find from the highway.) There were quite a few drunks after last call, who weren't very respectful of the other patrons and the hotel itself, but this did not detract from my stay. Valet parking was pricey.The breakfast buffet, which was complimentary because of my Hilton points, was delicious.Service overall was great -- a rarity today.I would definitely stay here again."

We were given a free room upgrade upon arrival so we had a very large 2 room suite. The location was very convienent for exploring downtown Boston. The hotel restaurant had a good breakfast.

They do have valet for $38 a night however we chose to park one block down in a garage thinking it would be cheaper and it ended upbeing $44...should have gone with the valet. When we first arrived we checked in and realized we didn't have a smoking room...we knew we would definitely want to smoke the more champagne we drank so we called the front desk and they already had a key made for us by the time we took the elevator down to the lobby. The beds I would have to say put the trip over the top!!! They are specially made from Serta for the Hilton and we have already gone to the hilton website to buy the bed and down mattress covering...you'll see what I mean when you get there,,,incredible. The hotel is conveniently located to the aquarium, quincy market, tons of pubs and restaurants. I would definitely go there again and would recommend it to anyone I know that wants to spend a little extra for the little details and finer things....even the shampoo is terrific!! Everyone should try this place at least once. After this trip, we are considering a move to Boston!!"

We had some trouble finding the place with all the crazy streets that comprise Boston, but were very happy with the place once we settled in. The hotel is conveniently located reasonably near the State and Aquarium stops on the subway line (which is the best way to get around in Boston), Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Government Center, and the Boston Aquarium (excellent and well worth the trip). If the weather is reasonable, it is also within a nice walk of Boston Common, Boston Garden (Make Way for Ducklings), and upscale shopping on Newberry and Boylston Streets. Our room was very comfortable in the nicely refurbished 1920's Art Deco building. The hotel had an excellent small restaurant with a fine buffet breakfast - free to Hilton Gold members. The hotel staff were uniformly attentive and pleasant. We enjoyed several nearby restaurants: Sakurabana (Japanese, of course), Black Rose (Irish Pub), Legal Seafoods (nearest is at Long Wharf), in addition to many eating options at Faneuil Hall. I would happily return to this location."

Its in a quiet area so there is no noise at night - very important if you have to get energy for next day shopping! The beds were amazing - a feather mattress topper is on my shopping list! The room was large, with two double beds, it was modern and bright. The bathroom was also large with great freebies! The only downside to this hotel was breakfast - everything is indiviually priced and pricy! I think they would have more customers if there was a set price and then you help yourself as they do in Hilton  Raddisson in Europe.Staff were all friendly and always available for questions.Would not hesitate to reccommend or stay here again."

The location is perfect - within 3 blocks of quincy market and some fantastic bars/restaurants and lots of shops, yet the hotel is in a really quiet street which feels a million miles away from the tourist centre. It's also close to the freedom trail and boston common and very accessible from the airport (2 stops on the 'T' and a very short walk).Check in staff were very accommodating and welcoming...much needed after 2 hours at immigration! We were upgraded to an extremely spacious and well equipped suite, which had everything you could possibly want from a hotel, other than perhaps a good view - surrounded by tall buildings.The hotel staff were quick to meet any of our needs - more towels and milk for coffee, at any time of day. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the bathroom very clean.We didn't really use any other hotel facilities, although there is a lovely library off of the lobby and the restaurant looked lovely. Concierge was very helpful looking after our bags after check out until we were ready to leave for the airport.When we go back to Boston, this is the only hotel we will consider! We got a very cheap deal with trailfinders - 3 nights for 拢160 for the 2 of us."

This hotel is lovely and in a very conventient location, however, if you want to sleep at night before 3am, don't bother staying here. We got to our hotel at about 9:45 pm, crawled into bed as we had an early departure out of the city, and all we could hear was the music from the bar across the street and people out on the street. We called the front desk at about midnight to ask for a resolve and they said they wasn't anything they could do as we were the first to complain. We called the front desk again at 1:30am and asked if they had any earplugs and was just told no. If you stay at this hotel, make sure your room is not across from Mr. Dooley's Bar and higher up than the 5th floor."

"Review_14174","hotel_189","hotel_7934","Mar 20, 2008","Worst Experience If you are a Federal employee, I'd advise you to stay away from this property. I arrived on Monday night for a three night stay while attending training. I provided my official identification and travel orders. The desk clerk told me that this information wouldn't be sufficient since my travel orders were e-mailed to me, I didn't have a tax exempt number (?), and I didn't have printed travel orders on official stationary, sign by my department head describing the purpose and length of my stay. I told him that he was wrong. He said that he'd check with his accounting office and leave me a message the next day. Apparently there was no one after four who could deal with this dilema. When I went back the next day, the clerk told me that the accounting person had called during the day when he wasn't working and asked if I'd like to speak with this person.  The next day the person in charge of my training spoke with the accounting person. A resolution was reached. If I provided a Form 9828, they would not charge sales tax for my stay. That afternoon, upon returning to the hotel, I provided the desk with the completed form with the direction to bring it to the accounting person. Upon checking out, the charges were still there."
"Review_14175","hotel_189","hotel_10602","Mar 19, 2008","Claustrophobic room; rude staff, great location I am surprised to see all the reviews of this hotel describing their large rooms. Our experience was not pleasant. We came to Boston to celebrate St Patrick's Day with my sister who lives in Boston. My sister and her son came with us as we checked in. A rude young woman at the desk smirked to my husband in mock surprise oh, your family is very large, implying that we were trying to stuff extra people into the room. We should have left the hotel at that point! Our room was very small (even by Manhattan standards!) and very dark- overlooking an interior alleyway. Our ceiling light had a naked bulb -- I asked for a globe to cover it as soon as we entered the room - but when we returned 4 hours later it was still not done. After a second request they finally fixed it. The tub drain did not work properly either. We picked this hotel for the excellent location,but I will never stay there again. Our overall impression was that it was an old, dark, cramped and aging building with creaking elevators and rude staff. There are other hotels in the vicinity that are a better choice."
"Review_14176","hotel_189","hotel_3943","Mar 8, 2008","Superb staff and great rooms! Stayed here for a convention in early March. Great view of Boston Harbor from my room on the 15th floor. Huge room with super comfy bed. Very quiet! Hotel bar was posh and the drink prices reflected that, but it is downtown Boston. Hotel bar closed at 11:30pm, but the staff was very helpful in helping us find some cheaper, more relaxed places to hang out that were very close by. Even on weeknights some of the local dance/karaoke places were hoppin'. Had room service for breakfast and it arrived quickly and everything was still hot. Only complaint was the limited table space (small round table next to bed full of stuff and a cluttered desk). Not really convenient for eating in your room. Everything was very clean and the shower and bath fixtures looked brand new (Kohler). Elegant lobby and brass finishings everywhere. After checking out (and reaching home 5 hours later), I realized that I left something. The cleaning staff could not find it, but said they would check in the laundry area. Got a call the next day. Great service!"

It snowed on our first day but that did not stop us, staff at the hotel were so so helpful, with directions and maps. Restaurant was very nice with staff on hand to advise on all aspects of food choices. I stayed here with my daughter (who is 18) and even she enjoyed it and we know how teenagers are so hard to please. I would go back tomorrow if I could. Complmentary coffee and warm apple cider were available in the foyer during the course of the day.This hotel was in a great location and all attractions in easy reach, and walking distance..

We had booked a triple and double room. On arrival we were shown to 2 identical rooms each with 2 double beds (queen sized for the UK readers, huge for single sleepers but tiny for 2 adults sharing); we mentioned to the wonderful bell boy we'd booked a triple and a double and we (the 3 sharing) were easily upgraded to a king suite with sofa bed. The rooms were well kept, clean and with adequate space, with lovely crabtree and Evelyn toilettries The staff we fantastic in the hotel; I had problems using a $500 travellers cheque in one shop (not accepted in most of Boston due to a freud problem), yet the conceierge went totally out of his way to find a store who would cash it for me, he was amazing, thanks Charles. The reception was welcoming with wood panneling and seasonal Christmas decor, enhanced by complementary hot chocolate or mulled apple available from mid afternoon onwards. The restaurant provided lovely food, but it was was pricey: there is an excellent Irish pub for evening meals and deli's for breakfast on the door step though. The location was great, the city is so walkable, Quincys Markets is 3 minutes walk away, yet the hotel was quiet- some of us who had previously stayed in NewYork for shopping trips were amazed at how silent the rooms were at night, and how quiet the streets were. We were so happy, we're already booked again for Dec 2008 which says it all!"

"Review_14182","hotel_189","hotel_9200","Jan 6, 2008","Great stay at the Hilton Stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights up to 30 Dec. We were in Boston to attend a family wedding and had a total of 8 rooms between 14 people which were conveniently all located on the same floor. Really liked the hotel, the room and bathroom were spacious, clean and well kept. As others have noted room size is really pot luck, we had a pretty decent double room, however my brother who was staying on his own had a room about twice as large as ours! In any case our room size was perfectly adequate for our needs. Beds were large and comfortable and there was a lovely selection of toiletries in the bathroom. Our room was kept clean and well tided and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Some of my family who were flying back to Ireland on 31 Dec asked for and were given a late checkout free of charge. Location is pretty quiet but there are still a number of restaurants closeby and you can either walk or take a short taxi journey to all sights.There were a couple of irritations during our stay. The water in the rooms cost a hefty $4.50 per bottle. Arriving off a long flight from Germany we didn't have much opportunity to go out and buy cheaper water, so ending up paying $9 for approx. 1 litre of water! In saying that the next evening when we got back to our room, we'd been given a couple of bottles of complimentary water, which was a nice gesture. My fiance was keen to check his emails whilst we were there. The hotel was advertising a rate of $9.99 for 24 hours in-room internet access via the TV (there was a keyboard attached). On signing up for this however it didn't work and when we rang the concierge they informed us that it was unavailable and that we should use the internet in the Business Center at a rate of $10 for 10 mins (which we didn't)! Other than these couple of minor issues our stay was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend the hotel to other travellers to Boston. We would definitely stay here again."
"Review_14183","hotel_189","hotel_8158","Jan 1, 2008","Nice but some frustrations I wanted to love the Hilton, and in some ways, I did, but in others, we were disappointed. My husband and I just came back from enjoying two days there relaxing over New Year's, and there were positives. Our room was clean and large by city standards, but I agree with earlier posts that size of room is completely luck of the draw based on what I saw on the floor diagram. The bed was very comfortable, and the location of the hotel was great for being out and about in the city for First Night -- close enough to get there fast but far enough away to avoid the worst of the noise. The staff was great -- helpful and courteous, though we were disappointed that our request for an upper-floor room was not duly noted until we pointed it out, and then we were only put on floor 9 (of a 15 floor hotel). Our room maid was wonderful, however. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was fabulous -- a really good buffet though it was part of a package for us. Not cheap if you have to pay separately, but worth it.And that brings me to the negatives. The hotel nickels and dimes you with charges for things that in other hotels might be part of the high rate charged. Wireless internet is on a per-day charge, and if you instead decide that you'll just use the hotel's Business Center, be prepared to pay a minimum of a $10 charge then $1 per minute after 10 minutes. This seemed ludicrous to us who just wanted to check our e-mail. The bottles of water in the room were available for a mere $4.50 each (we bought some of our own nearby for a lot less), and a $80 charge for dinner in the hotel bar when we only had a few drinks and two light entrees seemed really high, even by hotel restaurant standards. In general, it seemed that the four-star rating was not really warranted given how many of the little extras one expects at four-star locales involved extra charges here. In addition, there were some aging issues -- the sheet that had a hole along the edge where it was folded over on our bed; the scratchy towels that were too old to still be soft and fluffy; the slightly worn wood on the furniture like the arm chair and entertainment center. The room was also quite noisy, in part due to the expected city sounds, but also due to how easily we could here our loud neighbors across the hall as they came and went.It was not a bad experience -- in fact, we were quite happy when all was said and done. But with a little more inclusiveness in their rates and some upgrading of slightly aging fixtures, this hotel could more fully embody a four-star experience."

The staff were the most courteous and helpful of any hotel at which we've stayed. The concierge gave great recommendations on dining and things to do in the area and check in and out was smooth and easy. The room (a standard room with two queen beds) was much larger than rooms at comparably priced hotels and we really enjoyed a relaxing time.Two reasons prohibit me from giving this hotel 5 stars. (I won't even mention the $21 a night parking. I realize that this is the case pretty much anywhere, but it's highway robbery. At least the valet service was excellent and efficient). First of all - why charge for high speed internet when you're already getting $120 for the room (not counting parking)? That seems a bit greedy and unnecesary. Secondly, they charged me for a local phone call! It only amounted to fifty cents, but still. In a hotel this nice and service oriented you would think that internet and local calls should be included.Overall though - this was a great stay, we fully intend to return, and heartily recommend the Fairmont to anyone."

"Review_14188","hotel_190","hotel_3244","Nov 27, 2008","Would absolutely stay again We booked an air/hotel package through Travelocity with the purpose of seeing the King Tut exhibit at the Dallas Museum. Booked a regular King room and were pleased and surprised at check-in to be upgraded to a suite. The desk agent told us that he didn't have any King bed rooms left so was upgrading us to a king suite. Strange as the bartender later told us they were only at 12% capacity and we never saw a single other guest on our south tower elevators in 3 days. Hey, no complaints! The suite is wonderful. Nice walk in closet, sofas (one pulls out) and eating table in the sitting room with flat screen tv, large desk and sitting table in the bedroom with another large flat screen. The only complaint is with the design of the bathroom where the door nearly hits the toilet. You'd think that in the design of a suite they could've found another couple of feet to steal from the bedroom to make the bath more comfortable. Still, this is NOT a big deal.Service was incredible throughout. Very nice concierges who were helpful as was the rest of the staff. The bar never had more than 4 other guests in it. They told us that this is the low season for their main business which is conventions. Maybe that's why it was so nice and quiet. We were a little grumpy about the nickel and dime-ing that happens with the internet service. $13.95 to connect (wireless or wired) in the room. Then because I don't have a printer, I had to use the hotel's business center to print our boarding passes -- another $7.99 for those 6 minutes. At the price per night, I'd expect this to be less.The restaurant is one block from the museums which was perfect for us, and one block from the free McKinney Ave Trolley which can take you uptown a bit to more restaurants and shopping. The downtown area where the hotel is has zero restaurants for breakfast that we could find. If you don't mind walking, there are several good restaurants within about 1/2 mile. The very pricey but excellent Stephan Pyles is one block away. The Dallas Fish Market is also great (about 1/2 mile). We also walked to the JFK museum, about 3/4 mi. I think, and on the way the Village Corner Bakery is a good breakfast spot. We did this trip without a rental car which is doable but ONLY if you like/don't mind walking...a lot...for everything. This area has little but office buildings. We would stay here again for the service and quality."
"Review_14189","hotel_190","hotel_2676","Nov 25, 2008","Even better the second time! This was our second stay at the Fairmont. The level of service here is excellent. This stay we booked a Gold level room and felt it was really worth it. We had a corner room that was very nicely decorated in a more contemporary style than the room on our first stay. The bathroom door wasn't typical, it was more like a pocket door. There was a HUGE shower that was very enjoyable. The bathroom also had a makeup mirror, which I missed in the regular room. Still had a big walk in closet. The evening appetizers and morning breakfast were nice. Drinks are available but not included in the price of the room. We enjoyed the in room Nespresso machine as well as the one in the lounge. Before our trip I emailed the hotel for restaurant ideas. The concierge staff responded quickly and very professionally to our requests. They made all our dinner reservations for us, so we had no worries about where to go for dinner. We had one dinner in the hotel's Pyramid restaurant. The service was outstanding. The wine steward was a great help and provided some great information. My husband thought the filet he had for dinner was one of the best ever. My lamb needed a bit of work, but was cooked as I ordered. We shared a charcuterie appetizer and it was a good choice. We didn't order a dessert as the hotel had delivered a pice of cake to our room to celebrate my birthday. Every staff person at this hotel greeted us warmly, and it didn't seem forced as I would have expected. The housekeeping staff left me a thank you note for leaving a dollar tip on the bed every morning and evening. It's hard to find any real problems at this hotel. It is an older property, but the service is more than enough to make up for that. I will certainly stay here again and I will book the Gold room for future stays as well. Thank you Fairmont Dallas!!"
"Review_14190","hotel_190","hotel_7172","Nov 14, 2008","First Class Service We purchased a $299 package which included dinner at the Pyramid for 2, free valet parking and 2 VIP tickets to Tutankhamun exhibit at Dallas Museum of Art. The room is supposed to be a suite but we realized after we'd unpacked that we were not booked into a suite. The front desk offered to move us but we had to get to dinner so we asked for free room service for breakfast and late check-out, both of which we received. The air conditioner was not working and it was an unseasonable 75 degrees outside; an engineer came up to fix it and we froze the rest of our overnight stay. The shower heads are for short folks, although the bed was comfortable and the 14th floor room was very quiet. The VIP tickets, as promised, got us ahead on line so that we had less than a 5-minute wait even though there were groups of school children at 9 AM! Although this is not a first-rate hotel in terms of accommodation, it has the finest staff we have encountered in a long time and we stay at many 4 and 5-star hotels in the U.S. and abroad. To a person, every staff member we spoke to was happy and gracious. We complained about our room service espresso--weak and cold--and in 5 minutes we received replacements that were both hot and excellent."

Great location within walking distance of many places. Right around the corner is the fantastic restaurant Stephan Pyles. JFK Museum just a 10-minute walk, as is the entire Historic District with many other restaurants. The staff here goes out of their way to welcome you and greet you every day, from Front Desk people to Housekeeping, etc. The rooms are spotless and well appointed. The beds are so comfortable you might not want to get up in the morning! The hotel bar and restaurant, Pyramid, has great food for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Or if you'd rather like something light there is a Starbucks off the lobby to get a coffee and pastry in the morning. I honestly cannot think of anything that was negative. I would not stay anywhere else in Dallas."

The hotel is older and if you look closely you'll notice a few nicks and scratches around, but generally nice facilities. Everyone was very nice - front desk, reception, concierge, valet, housekeeping, bar. I was very impressed with the consistently friendly service. Oh, one complaint was the low-flow showerhead. Yuck. But what do I know, maybe Dallas is having a drought.The aquarium was an easy walk (2 or 3 blocks) and was great.

I was very satisfied with my choice. The service at this hotel is top-notch. My room was very nice 鈥?my favorite part was the large walk-in closet. Inside this big closet was an oversized safe that fit both my camcorder in its bag and my camera. The TV was a large flat screen. The bathroom was a little small and the tub and toilet could be updated, but the vanity was very nice. There were two plush robes available to use. I had to call the front desk right after I arrived to report a problem with the toilet flushing properly and someone arrived in less than 10 minutes. Housekeeping did an outstanding job, room service was good, and the concierge was always very helpful. The buffet breakfast was very good, although it lacked a good selection of fresh fruit. I have only two minor complaints about the room. At night you can hear the elevator running. If you sleep lightly as I do, it may bother you at first. I did get used to it. The room only had one electrical outlet that I could access. When I needed to use the iron or recharge my cell phone, etc., I had to get down on my hands and knees and crawl under the desk to plug it in.This hotel is within walking distance to many things, including the Plaza of the Americas, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Dallas World Aquarium, the West End, and the Sixth Floor Museum. I got a special rate of $155 per night and it was definitely a good price. I do think I would be hesitant to pay the rack rate of $300-$400. I only say this because the room is nice but not especially luxurious."

Right across the street is a very high end restaurant called Charlie Palmer. Pricey but well worth it! Also within a 1/4 mile walk of the Dallas Arts District. Dallas Museum is worth it. Great exhibits...nice collection. Modern Art museum is quite quite cool.The rooms are fine, but not really large. Kind of reminds you of an old style hotel from pre-war. Rooms are in good shape, clean, and latest amenities.Stayed here for a conference."

Booked one of their new Fairmont Gold Suites via Expedia.com, and was a little worried if the pictures and descriptions were 'too good to be true', but we felt the rate was appropriate for a club level - type suite at a luxury hotel (around $400/night). What can I say... I was SOOO impressed with the entire experience! We were escorted to the Gold floor as soon as we got out of our car at valet, and introduced to our private concierge at the Lounge. We were checked in, had dinner reservations made, and got a snack, within minutes of arriving - WOW! The suite was worth every cent - completely brand new everything. Loved the bed - didn't want to get out ever! Having access to the private lounge was the best part - we made it our 'home-away-from-home' over the next few days. My husband used it to get away from me for a few hours to do some work (ha ha), but it worked out nice for me because I used that time to relax and watch some sappy girl movies. The restaurant was fantastic - food quality, service, wine list - we were happy with everything at Pyramid. The location is perfect - I read some other reviews saying how there is nothing to do in the area, but those people must have been blind! The Dallas Art Museum and Nasher Sculpture Museum are 1 block from hotel, and we even walked to the Victory Park for dinner and a show at House of Blues the last night. Everything was perfect - you MUST stay at this lovely hotel!"
"Review_14197","hotel_190","hotel_5071","Jun 9, 2008","THIS is a Fairmont hotel????? My niece got married at the Fairmont and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I suppose the wedding part went ok. The Bride was happy and that is what mattered. BUT if Fairmonts are supposed to be in the upper echelon of hotels, this one falls EXTREMELY SHORT.We arrived after check in time the day of the wedding (about 3:20) and had 2 rooms booked. I would guess there were about 25 - 30 rooms booked for this wedding. One room was ready and the other was not. Same thing happened to my brother, one room was ready and one was not. We had plans to go to dinner before the wedding at a restaurant nearby. We waited in our sons' room for our room to be ready......nothing.....nothing. I finally called down about 4:30 as I needed to change clothes for dinner and wanted my room. They said they would put it on a priority cleaning status and that it would be at least another 30 minutes and that they would call (shouldn't they just bring me my keys???). Had to scrap our plan for dinner and just go grab a bite at the hotel bar. ( Mediocre at best). Mother of hte bride walked by and asked how things were and if we were settled....we told her we were still waiting for our room....she went to desk and got a manager and came back with keys. The room had just been cleaned! So we got into the room about 5:30. A/C did not work well at all. Room was hot even though it was set on 72....there was no way the room was 72. We turned it down and turned up the fan speed. Bathroom temp was unbearable, had to bring my makeup/hair supplies out to the desk in order to have some decent ventilation and cool air. Sons' room was the same as temp goes...as was my brother's rooms. Was a sweaty mess by the time we left for the wedding downstairs.......lovely way to feel!Room was still warm when we came back up.....front desk staff was not helpful.Would NEVER stay here again!"

The hotel is very clean, and our room was spacious with floor to ceiling windows (room 1910). The pool was good, but not spectacular; it could use a little modernization. I was very impressed with the level of service. The staff, from the valet to the concierge, were all extremely friendly and helpful. I appreciated that they even remembered my name and greeted me on arrival and departure. We ordered room service for twice and were very impressed both times. I emailed Phillip, one of the concierges, prior to our arrival with some questions and his responses were helpful and efficient. Keep in mind that the area around the hotel is pretty dead on weekends. We struggled finding a place within walking distance to have breakfast. We don't travel to Dallas very often, but we would definitely stay at the Fairmont again."

The front desk personal friendly  helpful, Concierge desk extremely helpful and accommodating, rooms clean  quite spacious, and comfortable beds. The reservation department was informative and easy to work with. The media center had one printer down and it added a minor expense. There is fine dining and food available at the bar area, however there was no moderate restaurant. Definitely would recommend and stay there on my next Dallas trip."

From what I heard, Fairmont is supposed to be a superb hotel.That was not the case. It is run down and is in need of some updates. They had a few nice amenities, like a flat screen TV, and large rooms, but that was about it. The desk only had one electrical plug for my computer and the bathroom was nice, but needed some deep cleaning. The clock radio was from the 80's. I also noticed some spots on the sheets. They were clean, but had permanent spots. I wouldn't pay that much to stay there for a vacation. It's not worth paying that much for the name. Go down the street to the Westin.The hotel is also in a neighborhood without much to do. There were a few nice restaurants, but it is definitely an 'office' area of town."

I highly recommend it to anyone staying in Dallas.Facilities: The lobby is upscale and never too crowded. They have a nice pool  gym, as well as an upscale restaurant. A starbucks opened the day I checked out.Rooms: Very comfortable beds and nice bathroom with ample space. They even had a walk-in closet. My only complaint is that the rooms could be bigger. It was a tight squeeze with 2 beds in it.Food: I ate at a few catered events and it was very good compared to most other hotel food I have had in the past. Service: Was great!! Everyone there was super helpful, room service was a breeze. I even had a small problem with the bill and it was corrected quickly with no questions asked."

Their loyalty progam web interface sucks big time with the Canadian counterparts lagging far behind in updates and transparency of your credits/earnings.

"Review_14206","hotel_190","hotel_3656","Feb 24, 2008","High noise levels and tired rooms mar good service It sounded like an unmissable opportunity -- a combination of two Fairmont upgrade certificates and a last-minute cancellation at the hotel meant I obtained an enormous king bed suite for the equivalent of $150 a night instead of the $350 a night it should have cost. I should have known it was too good to be true.I often wonder whether the management at hotels actually spend the night there occasionally to see what guests go through. If the Fairmont by chance does this, it's been some time since the last try-out. They need to take a look at this property.First impressions are good. It's in an excellent location downtown and the lobby is as plush and impressive as you'd expect from a Fairmont. The service was good. Unfortunately, the room wasn't the same. It was the size of a small European country with a large sitting room and an enormous bedroom. The furnishings looked a tad tired and for some bizarre reason the insides of all the windows were soaking, so the first noise I head was a gentle drip-drip of water dripping on to the carpet. The bathroom was small and the tub was miniscule, no longer than about four and a half feet, so I had real trouble getting washed. And this in what was undoubtedly supposed to be one of the best rooms in the hotel.Worse was to come. I was on the 21st floor of the south tower in a room that looked out both over a highway and some sort of industrial facility (or a massive block of air conditioning units) which churned out an amazing amount of noise. I quickly fled the bedroom and took refuge on the sofa bed in the sitting room, which of course happened to be next to the elevator machinery. So I slept badly all three nights.Everywhere there are signs of people asleep on the job. The TV turned on with the greatest of difficulty (I had to press the button with both thumbs) and when I called downstairs to ask about the handy Internet on the TV screen function the person at the other end said Oh, I've got a note here, it doesn't work.According to the room guide you could either have a formal breakfast in the restaurant or something less formal in the lounge downstairs. Nothing was on offer in the lounge for the three days I was there. That said, the restaurant breakfast was very good (as tends to be the case with Fairmont) and I consider $18.50 for an unlimited hot buffet in the morning a great offer. Dinner in the restaurant was pretty good too.A hint -- don't bother paying the daily $20 valet parking charge. There are plenty of parking meters and lots very close to the hotel.If I came back I'd insist on a room well away from the noisy side of the hotel. That is, if I come back. I think I might try somewhere else in Dallas the next time I'm in town."
"Review_14207","hotel_190","hotel_6767","Jan 29, 2008","Fair Enough Fairmont We stayed here for 2 nights and had booked a smoking room yeah i know how bad it is but well we were on holidays and the option was there. I found the check in staff quiet abrupt, she growled that firstly she did'nt think they took travellers cheques and that she did'nt have a smoking room because they were busy, fair enough but i had gone to the trouble of phoning to enquire about both issuses and was told neither was a problem. The receptionist stomped around because i had a few traveller cheques to sign and then gave me a key and i had to ask her what floor, i found her attitude a bit crap and i was after an 11 hour flight with stopover and delays. The room was nice but small and the bed was small for a kingsize but squash in and it was comfy. We had a corner room so maybe avoid this type. The bathroom was small but spotless with nice selection of toilitries and towels. Concierge desk was a breath of fresh air very polite and helpful. The hotel itself is lovely a bit of old fashioned glamour in a handy location quiet close to Dealey Plaza and there is tourist office also near Dealey Plaza which was convient .Breakfast outside the hotel is mission impossible,however if you walk towards Dealey Plaza there is a carpark on open ground and on it in a corner is a strange almost invisible little blue and white hut which was fab...looks aren't everything as you stand outside,my husband has a serious food allergy so we can't just eat anywhere. For restaurants there are a few nice ones just 4/5 minutes stroll from the hotel and they are lovely.Not a lot to do downtown at the weekends its a bit deserted. Overall we had a good time ,hotel is nice and well kept"

Like all Fairmont hotels (as far as I can tell) the bathroom was surprisingly small; however, the bedroom was huge, especially for the miserly $279/nt that I paid for it. The rooms are as dully conservative as you would expect for a business hotel of this type, but they are at least tasteful and up-to-date, not to mention immaculately maintained. The hotel's restaurants and bars are very pleasant and the staff are efficient and charming. There is nothing extraordinary about this hotel, but it is a pleasant place to spend a night or two."

I was booked here for a convention we are on so although I could have stayed at other hotels, this place was more convenient so we decided to be here.After I booked I read reviews and I like that a place can have so many opinions from 1 to 5 stars but it makes me nervous when so many are negative.I have to say that this stay has been NOTHING but pleasant.The staff calls me Mr...... The room service last night was short of excellent only because we felt the ham  cheese croissant should have been served warm, but my stak sandwhich was EXCELLENT. It was delivered between 11 pm and 11:20 (fast for room service).The temperature was easily adjustable (contrary to other reviewers).The bed was yummily comfortable. The breakfast buffet is one of the best we have ever eaten with thought given to how they served what they served.Little things...We couldn't bring toothpaste/deodorant...Rather than buy at the gift shop we asked directions for a local drug store. The polite valet suggested we ask the front desk and they gave us his/hers...Then toothpaste, shave cream...When I needed my boarding pass printed I went to the front desk for access to the business center. She said she could do it there but I thought it would be too much of a hassle for them to so I declined.The fee for printing there was so high I went back and said okay heres how you log in...She did it in 2 minutes!Yes, the exterior is a little dated (but made up for in an oppulant lobby). The room wasn't huge but comfortable and clean.Bottom line is this: Would I stay again? YES!"

Helpful friendly staff at the reception desk. Our room was large, with a very comfortable bed and very clean.

I booked three single rooms with king sized beds, when I got to my room, there were two beds. But when I went downstairs to complain, the man at the front desk said since I booked through Expedia, they don't guarantee rooms.The room was okay, I was somewhat annoyed because there was what looked to be a food stain on the duster of the bed. A little gross.The breakfast was okay, the table dirty and the service was slow.When I checked out, I asked for a receipt, they couldn't give me one saying that since I booked through Expedia, they don't know how much I paid. This would have been fine but the woman at the front desk was outright RUDE.Lastly, when I got home, I noticed some weird things going on with my credit card. Turns out someone hacked my account and added themselves as an authorized user. The only way I can think this happened is someone either was watching or hacked my account when I was in the business center. There were some shady characters there, and I know not to look up financial information at hotels.Overall, no major issues but enough minor ones to make the stay unpleasant."

None of these things would matter alone, but all together show a lack of attention to detail and customer care.The worst was the driver who took us to the Galleria Mall in the hotel shuttle. He crammed more people in the van than there was seat belts for. He did not wear a seatbelt. He had the radio set to an offensive rap station full of explicit sexual language.

Flat screen TV (although with only a couple dozen channels), Starbucks coffee, Bliss soaps and shampoo with a yummy mandarin mint scent, comfortable bed with fluffy white comforter.

"Review_14221","hotel_191","hotel_1638","Mar 20, 2008","Not what I expected Booked two rooms for three nights. Could not get one room with two double beds for any of the nights or even a roll away bed. I booked this through Priceline so that was probably one of the problems. The hotel could not accomodate us on anything. Do not know if this was due to us being priceline customers or the fact that they had a hotel full of youth soccer players who had free reign of the hotel. The continual running up and down the halls yelling and screaming did not add to the atmosphere. Rooms were fairly decent but seemed hollow. The doors were paper thin and being close to the elevator was a pain due to the constant flow of people all night. Having to listen to their loud conversations while trying to sleep was not pleasant. Only two of three elevators worked and the two that worked were extremely slow. My son called for a channel guide because there was not one in the room, the lobby sent one up. The next night my daughter in another room called for a channel guide and they made her go down and get it. I guess this place is hit or miss on the service and we definitely had a stay that was far from pleasant. We are not fussy people as were are a family with four kids and know traveling is never going to be perfect but this was not what we were expecting from a hotel of this supposed caliber. I am glad I did not pay the going advertised rates because I would have really been upset. Happy travels."

"Review_14225","hotel_192","hotel_4453","Nov 25, 2008","Hotel OK -- you can do better elsewhere My family used to stay at this hotel decades ago when I was a kid, but I hadn't stayed here in 25+ years. My husband and I stayed here for several days over a weekend. We were in town to see family and also were working during the trip, so we used the internet access. Overall, I wasn't impressed, and I will not stay here again. On the positive side, the front desk staff were nice, the hotel had been renovated fairly recently, Doubletree still gives out their famous chocolate chip cookies, and the location is convenient (right by Northpark and the freeway). The biggest negative was that we got stuck in a smoking room, despite having talked to them on the phone in advance and gotten their commitment to reserve a non-smoking room. When we arrived to check in, they said they they didn't have a record of that and no non-smoking rooms were available. So we were stuck; if we had walked out and gone elsewhere, we would have been stuck with the first night charge as a cancellation fee. So we sucked it up and stayed there. What I suspect happened, is that because they had a very large conference in the hotel that weekend (some kind of personal success tony robbins type thing) -- my guess is that the conference ended up wanting more rooms / more non-smoking rooms, and the hotel accommodated the conference people at the expense of those few of us at the hotel that weren't part of the conference. Which makes sense from a financial perspective, but it screwed up our stay. The non-smoking room had been cleaned of course, but it did smell quite musty -- and the worst part, when I got home, was realizing that all my clothes absolutely STANK of smoke. I'm not particular sensitive to smells -- but once out of the room, it was obvious how bad the air had been. I ended up washing, dry-cleaning, and airing out all clothes, shoes and luggage I'd taken on the trip to get rid of the smell. A minor annoyance is the internet fee. It's standard for a lot of upscale hotels (the Ritz Carltons of the world) -- but, most of the business hotels now (and all the discount hotels) offer internet as complimentary. So that additional $10-per-day ding is unnecessary and I was a little surprised that Doubletree was still charging it. We weren't bothered by the conference crowds, but then we didn't use any of the public areas (they did look pretty crowded when we walked through). Parking was a bit of a hassle. The hotel shares its parking with the two big office towers next door, which means parking during the week is crowded, and then parking at the weekend was crowded due to the conference. The main front-door lot isn't large enough, and the underground parking is a little confusing/badly signed, and creepy and isolated at night ( so if you're a female guest alone, you might be uncomfortable parking in the underground garage esp at night ). Bottom line: there are a lot of hotels within a few miles of this place -- you can get a better deal than this."

I had extra towels all the time. When I needed something I just had to ask and it was there. The beds were changed daily.Their buffets are a little high priced for me, the food is ok. I did not mind the short walk to the food courts so I paid half of the price that buffet was.There are several places to go in walking are accross the street to the right. Also in the back toward the right. It is a very convient spot to stay.The only thng wrong was the cofee maker, I could not get it to work. The workers were really polite.

I鈥檓 Hilton Gold, so was given a very nice corner room on an upper floor; floor-to-ceiling glass on two of the four walls- nice, even though the view was highway and office buildings. Room was certainly clean. Yes, yes, the bathroom had big stars on the wallpaper, and the hardware was in black metal鈥?this is Texas, and it was done in good taste. Bathroom also clean. The whole hotel had very solid wifi, and I was super happy about this.I must commend this property for the conference room we were in. Excellent food, frequent beverage refills, brand name stuff, and they responded to side requests very quickly. The restaurant was good, and that鈥檚 important鈥?because there is nothing (as previously reported) in walking distance. One day, they even had a separate table out in the lobby for quick sandwiches. Very smart, nice touch.There is a Starbucks about a football field distance from the hotel, and they opened at 5:30am while I was there.Good visit. I wouldn鈥檛 stay here as a base to tourist Dallas, but if you need to be in one of the adjacent office buildings, or have meetings here, it鈥檚 absolutely fine. (and chocolate chip cookies at check-in rock!)"

The hotel boasts a framed collection of native American arrow heads and the lobby is decorated in a vibrant and tasteful way. There's a comedy club next door. I had a corner room with good views and high speed internet, while breakfast was hearty with a good range of choices. The staff seemed attentive and friendly and there was plenty of parking out front."
"Review_14230","hotel_192","hotel_6665","Apr 7, 2008","Watch your wallet! We stayed at this hotel while at a high school class reunion. It advertised free wireless internet access, but we found out that it's only free in the lobby, which can be noisy and crowded.If you want to use your laptop in your room, it will cost you $10 a day.And don't even think of using the phone to call anyone. Local calls are more than $6 each, though nothing in the hotel information gives the price. Heaven knows what long distance would be. We complained when we checked out and the manager said he would take $13 off our bill, paid by credit card. We'll be waiting to see if that actually happens! If not we'll protest the charge with the credit card company.Two Midwesterners"
"Review_14231","hotel_192","hotel_1761","Mar 7, 2008","Good Hotel My stay at the Doubletree Hotel was for a conference. The hotel is located in what a friend of mine described as an 鈥渋sland d in a sea of freeways.鈥?Nestled between two office towers called the Campbell Centre I and II, the hotel is near the Northpark shopping mall. This upscale shopping mall is within walking distance of the hotel and there are several good restaurants located near the mall. However, there is no way to walk to any place close by due to the lack of sidewalks or pedestrian paths. The only way to get anywhere safely is by car, the hotel shuttle or a taxi. Be prepared to rely on your own wheels, a taxi, a shuttle or a friend鈥檚 car for getting around or risk being hit by a car trying to walk anywhere. If you do drive yourself, there is free outdoor parking in front of the hotel entrance. You can also use the free underground parking directly under the hotel. Ask at the front desk when you check in about it and they will give you the access code for gaining entry and exit. There is an elevator you that will take directly from the underground parking garage directly to your hotel room floor. At check-in the staff at the front desk was very friendly and they give out free fresh baked cookies in the afternoons. The front desk was very good about answering questions and making suggestions for dinner and lining up transportation via the hotel shuttle. The rooms appear to be recently remodeled and were clean. The beds were comfortable and they were fitted with down comforters and down pillows. My bathroom was papered with large stars, for the Lone Star State, somewhat overwhelming. The bathroom amenities consisted of face and bath soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and a small tube of face cream, all Neutrogena products. Be aware that the water from the tap is not pleasant to drink. However, the hotel doesn鈥檛 miss a beat and provides a large bottle of water on the dresser for $4.00. You might want to consider going to the convenience store next to the hotel or the Bay Street Deli next-door for cheaper bottled water. See my notes below for locations of these places. All the rooms have floor to ceiling windows with good views. I was located on the 4th floor. During the time I stayed here a winter storm arrived with rain and cold. Upon arrival my windows were covered with condensation and there were puddles of water on the floor window ledge. A leak in the window created a constant drip. When the rain stopped the condensation went away as well as the drip. The heating and cooling system worked well, but the room had a slight musty odor that must have been due to the high humidity in the room. The windows could not be opened, so there was no way to get any outside fresh air into the room. During my stay housekeeping was prompted, but they didn鈥檛 seem to do a good job of vacuuming the room each day. They also didn鈥檛 leave an extra roll of toilet paper, so if you arrive and it is low, ask for more.The hotel has a workout room and an outside running/walking area on the 2nd floor. The equipment was a good variety, high tech, some with individual TVs and included treadmills, bikes, weight machine, free weights and best of all a really clean exercise room! I didn't check out the pool. The hotel also has an agreement with local nearby gym that you can use for $15 a day. You can try to walk the short distance to the gym, but I would suggest that you use the hotel shuttle to get there or risk being run over by the local traffic. Room service was prompt, but the prices, were a bit high. They also charge an additional 21% for a room services tip and a $2.00 service fee in addition to the regular sales tax. A bowl of soup, $4 on the menu ran to almost $7 with the add-ons. The restaurant food, which is also the room service vendor, was good and the selection was adequate. However, if you don鈥檛 want to spend a lot there is place called the Bay Street Deli that is located just off the hotel lobby near the restaurant in one of the Campbell Center buildings which are connected to the hotel. The Deli served a quick hot breakfast, hot lunch and sandwiches. To get there go past the hotel restaurant and gift shop, up the stairs, through the double glass doors and into the Campbell Center building. You will see it on the right as you walk down that hallway. The prices there are very reasonable; I paid $5 for a large two enchilada meal with pinto beans and coleslaw. This was not a simple quick dish, it really tasted like something you would get a good Mexican restaurant. The Deli is not associated with the hotel. There is also a bar lounge that is open to the lobby, just across from the hotel restaurant. The lounge opens into an area that is also a library of books that you can take to read. There are hundreds of hardback books available with a variety of titles. It is on the honor system to return them.The conference rooms were well lighted. The room we were in was somewhat cool, but when requested the hotel staff was able to elevate the temperature to a decent level. The noise level from another conference, across the wall divider from our conference, at times was annoying. There is light rail train that you can take to downtown Dallas and areas north of the hotel. This light rail train runs right by the hotel. Unfortunately, you have to take the hotel shuttle to the train station down the road a ways as the train does not stop at the hotel.If you do need to visit a convenience store there is one located just next to the hotel on the east side. To get there safely you will need to go through the underground parking garage and walk out the east entrance drive, across the light rail tracks and into the convenience store parking lot. Again, there are no sidewalks, so be careful. Not the greatest place to be stranded for a week, but it was pleasant and I would come back."
"Review_14232","hotel_192","hotel_1484","Feb 7, 2008","Is this a hotel or a disco? I posted a review a couple of months ago about how much we enjoyed this hotel. I wish I could say the same about our most recent stay but that is just not the case. This was probably our worst hotel stay ever and I don't know if I can go back to see if they 'break the tie' and redeem themselves by staying another time. When we arrived at the Doubletree we were pleased to get a great room on the 20th floor. We left for dinner and when we returned there was a band playing on the 21st floor that was incredibly loud - it sounded like we were in a disco. The bass was so loud it sent ripples through the bottled water on the nightstand. We called down to the front desk and were assured that the party would end at 10. So we figured we'd watch a little tv and wait until it ended. 10:30 came and the band was still going strong. We called downstairs again and the assured us that by 11 they would wrap it up and be done but if we wanted to change rooms they would move us. Since I was already unpacked and in bed I didn't want to move so we decided to tough it out another half hour. At 11:15 I called again - band still going strong and we were told the manager was on the way upstairs because they'd had complaints to the 16th floor. At 10 past midnight we called downstairs AGAIN and were told that it is a birthday party and they paid for the room until 1 am so the band might play that long. I threw on some clothes and went down to the front desk where two morons who were not at all apologetic and told me they could do nothing about the noise but would move us (reluctantly) to another room. We went back to the room, packed all of our stuff and MOVED in the middle of the night to the 5th floor. We called the Hilton Diamond line 4 times in the midst of all of this and they told us they called the manager of the property but there was nothing they could do. When we finally got to our new room we could still hear the bass pounding away all the way down to the 5th floor but finally got some sleep. The next morning we went down and asked to speak with the manager who was too busy to see us. We have 260 Hilton nights in the last 12 months and this is the WORST Hilton property we've had in all of that time. We have loved this hotel in the past and are terribly disappointed in the lack of interest on the part of the staff and management at this hotel. They could care less that the ridiculous planning that would allow a party with a loud band to hold the hotel hostage until 1 am would make the rest of their guests very unhappy.Bottom line is if a facility wants to book parties that go on to the wee hours be a nightclub - if you want to be a HOTEL where people SLEEP shut the music down at 10. But you can not do both. We have contacted Hilton corporate about this complaint and would encourage others to do so also if they have a similar issue."

They are claiming that the room they gave me is newly-renovated. Renovated??Hello???! The room was horrible! The furniture are tacky. They are uncomfortable, disgusting and cheap-looking. Also, the room was not properly cleaned - there are hairs in the bathroom. The breakfast area was filthy! The parking area (basement) was sickening- it's flooded with water!  What a waste of money!!

I agree with another reviewer that this hotel does not meet Hilton standards and I cannot understand how it can have an 鈥淓mbassy Suites鈥?sign on the front. I arrived very late and entered my room which was reeked of stale cigarette smoke, moisture problems, and disinfectant. It was a non-smoking room. The room d茅cor and fixtures were in serious need of updating, adding to the dingy feel already created by the dim lighting and yellowed ceiling from years of tobacco smoke.The sheets on the bed were old and thin, and the pillows were in bad need of replacement.The good news: There appear to be renovations taking place, so if you end up going to this hotel is may be worth asking for an updated room at check in. I was so turned off I found another hotel."

The room smelled of disinfectant, the heating/air conditioning system was loud, the control impossible to manipulate, resulting in swings of temperature from hot to cold. The fan in the bathroom was so noisy it was better to bathe in the dark. The wireless internet would not work. When reported to the front desk, I was treated more rudely than I have been in many years. We originally booked a two night stay and left after one horrible night. Hilton should be ashamed."

The hotel is generally clean except the underground garage, which is a little too smelly and dirty for me. It is located at the intersection of major freeways so the noise is a given. But I slept OK.Some of things inside need major improvement. Like their gym, pool, furniture. They are just TOO old.We had to venture out to get a good meal. They are quite a few good restaurants around. The one inside the hotel is just mediocre.In general it is all right. But don't expect it to Wow you."

The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. I was assigned to a room with 2 double beds in the Reunion Tower. The lobby level is large and beautiful, but it was somewhat confusing to navigate. There is a very expensive coffee/snack shop and gift shop with very limited seating. The elevators were essentially efficient. I never waited longer than 2-3 minutes, even during busy times.My room was clean and comfortable. The bedding was luxurious! There was a small closet with an ironing board and iron. The TV was a decent size but I didn't much of a chance to watch it. The bathroom was also very nice. They provided plenty of towels and toiletries. My only complaint about the room was the lack of electrical outlets. I needed to plug in my laptop and cell phone chargers, and I found only 2 outlets and they were very difficult to reach.We did not eat in any of the hotel's restaraunts, but they looked nice. We did enjoy cocktails at the second floor bar, and we found the prices reasonable and the service adequate.Overall, I enjoyed this hotel and had a good experience."

"Review_14242","hotel_194","hotel_3379","Oct 7, 2008","Nice Hotel if on business at the convention Stayed here while exhibiting at a convention. It is about the closest hotel to the convention center (3 blocks) and reunion arena (next door) that you will find.Overall the rooms were very well kept and the service from the staff right up with any top notch hotel. Had a couple meals at the Centennial Diner and they were very good. Prices are a little higher than probably warranted, but still a good meal.Be aware that this hotel is not the easiest to get to in Dallas. In fact, downtown dallas is somewhat hard to drive within. It took me 30 minutes to get back to the hotel at night. I was only 1.5 miles from it, but very confusing to drive.I would stay here again on business, but would not for recreation."

This is your Graceland. The staff is very tolerant of this business model. I assume since there are so many rooms they always have vacancy so they just fill it up with large groups and anyone walking down the street.I would not pay the rates they advertise, if you use priceline they are always the buyer of a cheap fair, and it shows."

The room was medium sized and because we were here for a huge conference, there were no discounts, so the room was $145 per night for a king. There was no microwave, refrigerator or any other common convenience, but the coffee could be purchased downstairs and the cost rivaled Starbucks but the flavor didn't. The lamps were equivalent to a mid 80s motel except with fluorescent bulbs. Valet parking is $20 per night, and the internet is a whopping $10 for 24 hours. Oh and our key cards for the room were decoded twice in 3 days. This place was a massive expenditure and ruined an otherwise wonderful weekend."

Would recommend the Corner Bakery several blocks away for breakfast. Bar is also very expensive, $8.50 for a simple whiskey and 7-up. Extremely small pool for the size of the hotel, not many deck chairs. Requested frig 3 weeks in advance, none available on check-in, told it was first come, first served even if it was reserved. Finally got a frig. Very polite staff, although housekeeping knocked on the door at 830 AM. Great location, walking distance to at least 3 museums, the JFK 6th floor museum in the Dallas School Book Depository Building is a must-see. Lobby seating very limited, we were there for volleyball, not many places for team members to hang out together. One last tip, don't drink the $4.50 bottle of water in the room!"
"Review_14246","hotel_194","hotel_5616","Jul 2, 2008","Overrun by screaming 13 year olds Wow - DO NOT STAY HERE if you want to sleep. If you are interested in roaming bands of hundreds of unsupervised screaming children, apparently this is the place for you. There's really not much for kids at the hotel or in the area, so they were just chasing each other all over the hotel and joyriding in the elevators with the hotel staff doing nothing about it. Multiple times I waited over 20 minutes to get on an elevator along with a lot of annoyed adults. A group of kids would show up and literally push people out of the way to get on an elevator. I pointed out the  100 or so people waiting on an elevator to the front desk staff and they suggested I go up to the 2nd floor and try to get on there. Another 100 people were waiting for the elevators on the 2nd floor. I went back down and asked where the stairs are - to my room on the 12th floor.The atrium area echoes sound so badly that the sound of the bar, restaurant, and lobby (oh and don't forget all the screaming kids) is amplified and very loud inside the rooms, even with towels shoved under the door and the tv on. I'm not saying the hotel should be supervising other peoples kids, but if they book kids dance competitions and volleyball tournaments and allow children to stay in rooms together without an adult, then they created this situation and should take the responsibility to deal with the result. Clearly Hyatt was not prepared for the situation they created, or is not interested in maintaining their reputation with business customers - or adults in general, for that matter.Other than that, the rooms were ok, although becoming a bit worn (peeling paint, torn wallpaper, scuffed furniture, stains) and it doesn't look like they are properly maintaining this hotel. Most likely their business has fallen off due to Reunion arena and renovating reunion tower and this is the result.On the positive side, the valet staff was great and very friendly. The (Parrinos?) restaurant was surprisingly very good.I got this room for $60 on priceline - so beware on priceline - if you bid on a 4 star hotel downtown, you are most likely to get the hyatt. Check expedia - I stayed at the Adolphus and Stoneleigh previous weeks for ~130/night booking through expedia. The extra money is definitely worth being able to sleep and not having to take the stairs 12 flights to your room.Unless you are a screaming 13 year old and want to spend the night joyriding in hotel elevators, I suggest you not stay here."

There is a sports bar in the atrium which is incredibly noisy, even at 1 AM, and the noise carries straight through the door. If you cannot get a non-atrium room-- especially if you'll be here on a weekend night-- you should find some other hotel. We are talking about serious noise here. I am not super sensitive-- I live directly next to the Bay Bridge in San Francisco-- but this is loud and disturbing, clanking of glasses, shouting, etc., and it's still going at 1 AM. The front desk people were nice about it, and managed to find me earplugs once I insisted and talked to the manager, and they took off most of my internet charges, but it doesn't make up for an intolerable room."

My kids were totally bummed and had to check it out 2 different times throughout the day b4 there was enough room for them to even get in.

"Review_14253","hotel_194","hotel_1423","May 23, 2008","Wouldn't be my first chocie for a family vacation I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights in May. Check-in was a breeze and overall I didn鈥檛 have any problems with the room. The room was a good size and was clean. The Hyatt had a note in my room that said if you use your 鈥淧rivacy Please鈥?sign then the maids won鈥檛 change you room at all. I used this sign so I could leave my laptop setup when I was out of my room and to their credit the maids didn鈥檛 enter my room at all over the 4 days I was there (I left the sign out the whole time). I鈥檝e been to other hotels where they pretty much just ignore the sign and the maids enter at 8:00am anyway. I have different observations if you鈥檙e a business traveler versus a family traveling on vacation. I鈥檒l start with a quick tip for business travelers. I was traveling on business and high-speed internet is always key for me. I ended up on the 6th floor in a room pretty far away from the lobby area. When I connected to the hotels high-speed internet service via wi-fi (the only option possible in my room) the signal I got was very low. A number of times my connection would just drop when I was connected for even a short time. I asked at the front desk regarding what could be done and they gave me a device (they called it a booster) which plugged into my laptop and that did the trick. I didn鈥檛 have any problems with dropped connections after that and I didn鈥檛 have to pay anything for the booster, so good save on the Hyatt鈥檚 part since otherwise they would have had to move me to a room with better reception. As for my other business (and families) advice, the Hyatt isn鈥檛 near much in terms of restaurants that you can easily walk to so either rent a car if you tire easily of room service, expect to take some cab rides, or go across the street to the light-rail system if you want to venture away from the Hyatt (room service was actually pretty good and pretty fast 鈥?but not cheap). For families traveling who are looking for a resort experience just one word or warning, the pool and hot-tub at the Hyatt are fairly small and are on the roof on the 3rd floor. When I was there it was very, very hot on the roof with virtually no shade (no umbrellas or covered chairs). If your looking to spend some serious time by the pool I think that would make the Hyatt a bad choice -- I was out on the pool deck on a 90+ degree, sunny day and it was unbearable. Also, the Hyatt has a coffee shop on the lobby level, it鈥檚 a great place to get soft drinks, pizza or snacks for the kids. I almost walked past without noticing all the goodies they had for sale. Cab fare from DFW to the hotel was $45 and took about 30 minutes. My room faced the train tracks and I never was bothered by the noise, but you might want to ask for a room away from the tracks if your easily disturbed by outside noise."

The bedding ended up off the bed in the middle of the night and was just too much to make it acceptable. The location is scary....we were warned not to walk around after dark in this section of town. In our opinion, it just stays in business because of its location close to the convention center. If you are not at the convention center, don't waste your money and time here."

I checked in a day early and should have had been able to get a great room. Upon checking in the person asked if I wanted a higher or lower floor...I said I just wanted a good room. (But stay on a higher floor because the elevator is worth it!) The room was nice...until nighttime when the trains run all night long - they run all day too, but at that point I had not noticed. After a very long flight filled with delays, I wanted to sleep. So, ask for a room on the other side of the tracks!Good thing they serve Starbucks because you certainly can not go anywhere to get your early morning or midafternoon fix. This hotel is tucked away on the other side of a dark and very yucky underpass.The restaurants in the hotel are wonderful - great food and great service - but a short 8 block walk ($10 cab ride) passed the book depository has you on blocks of very good restaurants."
"Review_14258","hotel_194","hotel_10293","Apr 24, 2008","Standard Convention Hotel There is nothing wrong with this hotel, but it is a fairly standard convention hotel. A bit older (as is demonstrated by its cameo in the opening montage of the TV series, Dallas) but very well maintained. Rooms are standard Hyatt rooms. Location is odd, because although you're close to downtown, it is separated by a winding road beneath a railroad viaduct, making it a bit more inconvenient to walk anywhere than its location would suggest. My room had a beautiful view of downtown, including a direct line of sight to the iconic Reunion Tower (which is attached to the property). The hotel restaurant (Centennial Cafe) was not very good. By far the worst chicken fried steak I have ever had in Texas."

The location was good, with easy access to the trains and walking distance to the West End and convention center.However, our room was on a balcony overlooking the bar/restaurant area. Although the view was beautiful, the noise is horrific. The acoustics in the atrium make every noise sound like it's right outside your door and we were kept awake every night by noisy bar patrons until about 2 in the morning (I'm guessing that's closing time). It would have been nice if the hotel management had asked the bar patrons to be more considerate of those who use a hotel to sleep as I can't imagine they aren't aware of the noise issue."

Each time I was well pleased with the value for the money, but each time, the price was well under 50% of the lowest published rate. These Hyatts are 30-40 year-old convention hotels. They are 3-3.5 stars, not 4-star hotels. Nice rooms, nice amenities, but old and lacking the dreamy beds of nicer Starwood and Marriott hotels.The Dallas Hyatt sits at the edge of downtown, behind the railroad station. While some reviewers have complained of freight train noise, it should be no problem if you are used to even a little bit of big city traffic noise. It is set off from the rest of the downtown by some underpasses that are not particularly hospitable at night. Thus, while much of downtown is within walking distance, you may not wish to chance the walk after dark.The Hyatt has the obligatory huge atrium and multiple dining/drinking options. The next-door revolving restaurant tower, however, is under construction. The food/drinks were serviceable, if overpriced. The staff was most friendly and well-intentioned.Bottom line -- I wouldn't book this hotel at published rates. If I had a choice and a car, I would stay at a suburban hotel near dining/entertainment. This is one of those downtowns that shuts down at night. It is not a residential city center."

"Review_14264","hotel_194","hotel_7755","Jan 29, 2008","Service letdown The Hyatt Regency Dallas was chosen as the host hotel for a regional gymnastics competition we attended this past weekend.Fourteen families from Washington (state) stayed at the hotel for one night.My family had a one-bedroom suite and it was considerably nicer than the average suite through the lack of a minibar/fridge was a minor inconvenience.The rooms are modern and clean, the beds are comfortable, and the hotel staff is friendly and helpful.However, the issues we (and other families in our group) had with room service were terrible.After tallying up the damage our group ended up with 4 dinners delivered more than one hour after promised time (out of 5 dinners ordered).In our case, we ordered breakfast for 6:30-6:45am. Because of past issues at Hyatt's we not only filled out the door-hanger-menu but we gave it to one of the staff who delivered it to room service the night before.We needed to leave the hotel at 7:15am sharp for the gymnastics meet.At 7:05, no breakfast. I called room service, they acknowledged my order, but said they were busier than usual and it would be at least 15 more minutes before breakfast would be delivered.We cancelled breakfast (and were not charged for it) and were able to run to a nearby store and get a bagel and some fruit juice.On the bus over to the gymnastics meet we talked to other parents who were very upset that they travelled 2000 miles, stayed in a fairly high-end hotel, and now their kids would be competing in a 4-hour gymnastics meet without having had breakfast.This is something that would be forgivable for a 2-star hotel but not for a 3-star or higher hotel.It's possible the room service experience might be better if the hotel were half full or less. I won't be returning to this Hyatt. If you plan to stay there I recommend:1) Find out how full they expect the hotel to be when you are staying there. 2) Don't depend on room service. Have a back-up plan or be OK waiting."
"Review_14265","hotel_194","hotel_5465","Jan 2, 2008","It's big and somewhat pricey - good location Stayed over new years 31st -2nd. This place will always have lots of football fans attending the Cotton Bowl over new years, so it gets slammed . They were the host hotel for one of the football teams - so mostly all fans from one school - just make sure that is your team. They do a decent job of managing the crowds, especially at the valet. The rooms were just okay - not as clean as I hoped - somewhat dirty pillow cases, but they do have 1100 rooms, so I cut them some slack. The location is great as they are connected to the DART public transit system, real close to the West end and only a $10 or so cab ride up to the uptown area (I suggest two restaurants in uptown - Cuba Libre and Zizikis). The main bar in the atrium is pretty nice, lots of TVs, places to lounge and shuffelboard. One disappointing note was that due to being completely sold out with so many late check outs, as of 3 PM new year's day, they did not get around to cleaning our room and said that the staff was going home at 5:30, so it couldn't be done. Valet parking at $18 (free entry/leave) seemed worth it over trying to figure out and haul to a further parking lot for $10 (which was not free entry/leave). Did find out the attached Reunion Tower is closed for remodling till sometime late in 2008. It's a bit tricky to get to the hotel itself off the Interstate, make sure you have some detailed directions or a GPS."

Usually, this makes a staff cranky and unpleasant, in my experience. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I like to stay in hotels that have upgraded to softer mattresses with sheets/down comforters instead of gross bedspreads, and the Hyatt fit the bill. My only complaint - and it could be a big one for some people - is that one side of the hotel overlooks three train tracks. Two of the tracks carry commuter traffic and the third seems to be a regular freight train track. During the night, trains ran OFTEN with increasing frequency as the morning arrived. Twice during the night freight trains came through and my floor literally vibrated from the noise (by the way, I was all the way on the 6th floor). It was a little creepy and I thought I might have imagined it, but it occured the second night we were there also.If you plan a visit to the Hyatt, ask to be put on the far side of the hotel away from the trains and you will probably be okay."

The conference facilities were outstanding, the restaurant excellent, and the rooms very comfortable and clean. Not one of my participants had anything to say that was negative about their experience. The staff that I dealt with always were attentive to our needs and helpful to the max. It is one thing to get a review from one person staying one night, but I think the proof of the pudding is to be responsible for a 100 plus people and still not get one negative comment. I liked the location as it was easy to get to both sightseeing areas and trendy restaurants in the area. Shopping was easily accessible as well.

"Review_14270","hotel_195","hotel_10519","Jul 22, 2008","Horrible Service!! I booked my room and a room for my mother in law through hotwire back in Feb. I also blocked rooms for my wedding guests on the weekend of July 19th. From the moment I signed the contract to block rooms, the service became unbearable. I had an incredibly difficult time reaching anyone. It took me three days and a call to the corporate office before I was able to reach someone to schedule shuttle service for my wedding.When the time came for my mother in law to check in on Friday (she booked Friday night in addition to the night we booked her on hotwire) they couldn't find her reservation. I had to call a manager before they would find her a room. When she tried to use the free shuttle service they offer, they argued with her and tried to get out of providing the service. When we checked in on Saturday, the service was not great either. We had our entire wedding party as well as many of our guests staying and getting ready in the hotel. I had to go to the front desk to ask for a luggage cart and they couldn't even get one for me. She directed me to a staff only area and tole me I could get one from there. Not one of my guests was able to get and help with their luggage.The rooms were clean enough, but not great. Room service trays that were in the hallway when we checked in were still there when we checked out. Many stains on carpet and walls. I didn't shower there so I don't know about the bathrooms.Come time for check out on Sunday we found that they had double charge my mother in law and lost her hotwire reservation (that was already paid in full). It took over 30 minutes and a manager's assisatance to get it straightened out. When I requested a copy of my bill for the shuttle (We had to pay for the 'free' shuttle since we had a small group.) they were unable to give it to me. They charge by the person and the driver didn't record anything. They told me that they would email it to me later. The did email it to me, but they also double charged me on that.In short, had we not had non-refundable reservations through hotiwre, no one would have stayed at this hotel. The service was awful, the staff incompetent and the hotel dirty. For $9/night more than their reduced group rate (that was strangely enough, also available to the public online) we could have stayed at the Park Cities Hilton across the street from my wedding venue. Never again will I stay at a Radisson hotel."
"Review_14271","hotel_195","hotel_5616","Jun 24, 2008","great location, but ICK! I'm working for 4 weeks in downtown Dallas and I chose the Radisson for the location - an easy walk to the Mockbird light rail station which dropped me off right outside the building where I'm working. Plus there are shops, restaurants, and a movie theater with several independent films. Also around the Mockbird station, there's a Jason's Deli and a Kroger grocery.So beyond that, well.. the parking was free and every other place I stayed charged $20/night, and I got this place for $111/night, which was the cheapest. The bed was comfortable and the room had updated furniture. The staff was friendly. The wireless was free.Beyond that, the problem is someone did the worst job I have ever seen at remodeling this hotel. Its like their idea to make it look nice was to throw cheap paint on a dirty wall and call it done. The wallpaper is peeling off the walls and every corner you look in is rusty, dirty, falling apart. The power outlets are all filthy, the paint has been patched in places with different colors, the tub faucet is falling apart and rusted out, the shower head is mounted out nearly 2 inches from the chipped tile that's been painted over and is now peeling. They dripped and smudged paint all over the wallpaper, tile, and countertops and didn't bother to clean it up. It makes the whole room seem dirty. Its gross. This is the only hotel I've stayed at this month without a refrigerator (or minibar frig.) It looks like they added on the lobby section of the hotel and didn't bother to do a full structural remodel - there are boarded up rooms downstairs. My room on the 4th floor only has a window from halfway up and a lovely view of the roof of the lobby.I decided not to come back due to the condition of the room, regardless of the price and convenience."

When the front desk was asked about cleaning the rooms where 30 girls had been throwing up we were informed that the rooms would not be cleaned until the group left 2 days later and the girls were told that they needed to be responsible and clean up their own vomit and the vomit of their friends. When confronted about the possibility of food poisoning, the front desk waved us off and told us it was not their problem and that they would like to see us prove it! Interestingly enough, a group of cheerleaders the week before, stayed on the same floor and 2/3 of their group went home with food poisoning. If you stay in this hotel DO NOT eat the food and make sure that your room is clean because they told us themselves that they will not clean a room until you have checked out even if you have been throwing up for 3 days..."

I would have never booked if I had read the reviews that are now posted. The only review I read was a good one. Don't know when it was given...must have been in another life. Walking up on the hotel - we immediately started to question our stay. Not kept up and smelled a little stale. Desk clerks very unprofessional. Got to our room - and decided we needed to wear flip-flops at all times in the room. We could not relocate - it was OU/Tex game. Our friends in the room next to ours found dirty magazines in the bedside table - these were discusting - photos of old people in compromising positions. There we no ice machines to be found in the hotel. We went to 3 different floors - all the machines were pulled out of the wall. We had coffee in the room, no coffee pot. We found hair in the bathroom (small curley ones - yes, you guessed it). The blanket on the bed was old and had holes. The sheet on our bed was paper thin and during the night it popped up from the mattress. If I had only known what I was about to sleep on.....the mattress was ripped all over and filthy. Not a little ripped - but big time ripped and filthy, not a little stained - major and there was no mattress pad. I was totally discusted and furious. It made me sick to my stomach that I had paid $140.00 to slept on that mattress. I can't believe a hotel is allowed to have these types of mattresses in their hotel. I could go on and on as to what we found but I'm sure you get the picture. I let the desk clerk know of my discust when I left. She had no comment. BAD CHOICE! I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR MY WORST ENEMY!

However, when I first arrived, and throughout my stay at the plaza, I could not believe how wrong and misleading every one of these reviews was.. My stay, as you will read further, was certainly an enjoyable one as I spent three nights of my 4th of July weekend at the hotel.Check-in took about 2 min total. I booked my reservations online with the discounted $45.99 rate and reserved three nights in total for three people. My stay was actually split into two different reservations since I decided to add an additional night later during my vacation preparations. The front desk had not trouble at all with this and was able to continue my three night stay without having any problems. I did however have a little trouble with the first set of keys but the second set worked out just fine for the rest of the stay. Housekeeping was very nice and I got additional towels at the front desk upon request.Now, for the room: clean, organized, well furnished and free of foul scent of any kind. The room was like any other La Quintal or holiday inn room with an added bit of room to boot. The bathroom was clean, spacious and had all the amenities that I could ever want including shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, face soap, toothpaste, etc. etc.. The balcony looked safe and was very nice to walk out onto. The only thing I saw wrong with the room was a little coke stain near the door, that鈥檚 it! I was very pleased with the room, room service, guest service desk, etc.I went swimming in the pool after a light jog in downtown Dallas and it was amazing! The water was very warm and the area around the pool was nice and clean. Yes, there are a few holes in the wall area and the hot tub area is closed off but everything is still very nice. I鈥檓 not sure what people were expecting when they stayed at the Plaza but lets just say that I was very pleased once I saw for myself after reading the reviews. I continued to swim every morning and my buddies did the same as I reported how nice the facility really was..The wireless internet, although somewhat annoying to have to use the service in the lobby area only, works just fine and I enjoyed being able to use the internet during my stay.The 鈥渇itness center鈥?facility was a bit bare with only a couple of treadmills and workout stations. This is probably the worst part of the hotel: dark, stained, dirty, broken windows and cracked walls, etc. There were some pieces of equipment available that could prove useful if you were just determined to get some kind of a workout in. Actually, the center had about the same number of machines as any other hotel, just not as inviting and clean, big deal, I didn鈥檛 come to the Plaza to work out and neither should you. The hotel is somewhat of a 鈥渄eserted palace鈥?as I call it because there is nobody apparently taking advantage of the nice facility that the hotel really does encompass in some areas. The fitness center and outside appearance of the hotel is about the worst but areas such as the pool, rooms, lobby and hallway areas are just as good as any other basic hotel if not nicer. Sure, the hotel needs some work and the facility does show some wear in some areas, but you simply can not beat the online price that the hotel offers. You may not want to stay at the hotel for your honeymoon or anniversary, but the hotel is excellent for single men or college guys just looking for a decent place to stay downtown while they are enjoying the Dallas area. Not only was I able to enjoy the area but I also enjoyed the hotel鈥檚 accommodations as well.Except for the one night (Thursday), I did not see any homeless people, drug dealers, or *cough* women.. down in the parking lot like everyone on here is warning about. I did notice some 鈥渜uestionable鈥?guests checking in and out of the hotel, but these people would not harm a fly as they are probably from smaller towns and communities wishing to visit a larger metro area and experience the 鈥渃ity life鈥? Like everyone鈥檚 鈥渨arnings鈥?on this posting, I too am posting my warning too you: do not let these posting scare you, they are posted by mid-aged women and married couple who believe they have found a good deal at a five star hotel located in downtown Dallas, which simply isn鈥檛 going to happen. For the money, this hotel is fabulous. I am actually writing the rough draft to this review while sitting by the indoor pool on my second day of my stay. I am so confident in my initial impression that I decided to write this review to give those out there a sense of hope who want a cheap hotel for a good stay. I got nightmares at the thought that I had already prepaid for my stay at the Plaza and just now finding out how 鈥渉orrible鈥?it really is. Please, do not be worried, this hotel is not bad at all. If you read all of these other reviews and actually visit the hotel, you will be as surprised as I was when you arrive.. all is well."

I booked this hotel for two reasons; It was extremely cheap, and it was the closest hotel to the convention center.I got what I paid for. The area wasn't the best. The rooms seem to be booked out by the hour moreso than by the night. I was warned not to walk anywhere after dark, because it wasn't safe.On my second day there, the maid left my door open, and when I showed back up, I found my camera was missing. I contacted the front desk and sat in the lobby until they got a hold of the manager. The front desk clerk, Sandra Aldarado, never called the manager like she had said she did. It wasn't until 2 hours later, and I was totally irate, that she finally called the manager on her cell phone, and finally let me speak to her. The manager said that she would handle the situation in the morning. When the morning came, all that was done, was to fill out an incident report. I had to repeatedly insist on calling the police, and having them file a police report.It's amazing that Sandra, the front desk clerk, could reach the housekeeper Janice Curry, to find out that she never saw a camera in my room. I guess she has a habbit of going through peoples luggage or, just flat out lying when she knows she screwed up. The really amazing thing, was that Sandra couldn't reach the manager, but her lies kept telling me that the manager was on her way, and would be back soon.I would advise staying away from this hotel, at the very least until Tiffany Macguire, the manager, Sandra Aldarado, the front desk clerk, and Janice Curry, the housekeeper, are all fired.Maybe once the owners do some housecleaning, the place will improve.P.S. The hot tub has been broken for quite some time, with no intentions of repairing it.P.P.S. There is no bar, lounge, restaurant, or room service.P.P.P.S.

I called her out on it, and she said whoever booked must not have pushed the promo button, so the rate would be at least $119/night. Uh... where did the other 30 bucks come from? She finally relented and provided a receipt for me to sign with the total of $53.xx. Odd how it came to exactly $100 less than the original total.I got to my room, walked down the shabby halls with dingy carpet and peeling wallpaper, to find the room immediately to my left had no lock or handle...just holes through which anyone could peer. My own room was secure (especially once I propped a chair and ironing board up under the handle). It was too late for me to attempt finding another hotel, so I knew I was in for the night. I bring my own dream sack so I wasn't terribly concerned about unclean sheets. While looking for a note pad, I stumbled upon a crack pipe. Yes, a real one. I work with cops and have attended various conferences...enough to identify drug paraphanelia easily enough. I was surprised to find I had internet in my room despite the notice that it's available in their business center. (2 couches in the lobby.... if you can kick off one of the hobos)In the morning, when I was checking out, I informed the desk clerk of my pipe find. Her response, Oh. Someone must not have cleaned the room very well. !?!?!?While visiting the Dallas Police Dept., and relaying my encounter, they all rolled their eyes and confirmed they often see prostitutes entering and leaving. They insinuated the extra $100 charge was their pimp fee..... uh..... I looked like a prostitute... nice....This used to be owned by Ramada and when it was first sold to this private investor, they've promised it's under construction and will soon be renovated. That was 4 years ago. I can laugh about it now because I survived the night. I will never return!"
"Review_14284","hotel_196","hotel_8691","Feb 29, 2008","Good deal for the price. I booked through the hotel website and received a great price of $40 per night. I reserved a month early found no problems registering online or calling and confirming the hotel reservation.For all the bad reviews, I was talking to an employee for the hotel and the hotel will be renovated in a few months. Another hotel chain will take over and the name along with the old building and interior will all change. Therefore, if you need an inexpensive place to stay, then you only have a limited time.Anyhow, the check in process was easy. No problems. The lobby shows it's age and 1 of the 3 elevators is out of order. The room was clean. The bathroom was clean, floor seemed vacuumed and the beds were made. The room furnishings, carpet, walls all show their age and the balcony is off limits. The A/C and heat worked fine. No problems with hot or cold water and there was daily room service. The pool doesn't seem clean, and the pool area is dark and not very inviting. I don't swim anyways so it didn't matter. From the outside, the hotel looks old and dated.I was hesitant to stay here because of the prior reviews, but I think the prior reviewers had higher expectations. However, for $40 a night, the price can not be beat. I was attending an event at the convention center and was easily within walking distance. Basically, the rooms are clean, the water was hot/cold, the heating and cooling worked. Sure, there are no warm cookies when you check-in, and the room isn't furnished with the newest and greatest. But then again, the rooms are $40, instead of $150+ average of other hotels in the Dallas downtown area."

(Let the buyer beware) My father is a 79 year old dentist from Oklahoma City who needed to attend the recent Southwestern Dental Conference in Dallas. All of the rooms at the host hotels where he usually stays were booked (Adolphus, Magnolia, Fairmont) so we new we would have to look around the Dallas Market or up Central Expressway. The Dallas Plaza is 1/2 mile from the Dallas Convention Center. The convenience to the exhibits was what drew us to this hotel. I had just been in Dallas on business myself and we have been going to downtown Dallas since I was a child 40 years ago so, we knew the area was potentially rough and possibly dangerous, but the price was amazing. I told him he might have to bop his way into the hotel each night. He informed me that he did not receive the King bed as requested but the room was large with two double beds and a good TV. He did complain that two out of three lamps in the room did not work. I called to see if he had arrived his first night by 6:00 p.m., it took several attempts to get anyone to pick up the phone, but once they did answer they were courteous. However, that courtesy was not a standard of the Dallas Plaza. I called the hotel two days later to find out when he would be returning to OKC and to give him weather updates. Again it took at least 150 rings before anyone answered the phone. Then the front desk person said they couln't connect me unless I knew which Room # he was staying in and that they couldn't (or rather wouldn't) connect me. I had to tell them he was a 79 year old man traveling by himself before they eventually connected me. BOTTOM LINE: WE GOT WHAT WE EXPECTED! YOU CANT FIND A HOTEL IN DALLAS FOR LESS THAN $100 PER NIGHT AVG. UNLESS IT IS A FLOP HOUSE (and then it's still liable to be a flop house unless it is costing $149 or better). I sill would have expected better customer service. Just because a place is older and has had some wear and tear on it, doesn't mean that the customer service should also be lacking. I can't wait to go back to Dallas next month and check the place out in person, however, I won't be staying there! But I can always use some comic relief when I'm traveling. The other reviews were awesome. Everyone should watch the movie Four Rooms. I'll bet it is a similar kind of place. Dad isn't one to complain having grown up during the Depression, so I'll have to see it with my own eyes to experience the real feel."

I looked at many hotels but wanting to spend my money partying instead of on a room I wasn't going to be at all that much, this hotel was priced right. OMG! I'm glad I was half drunk when I got there. I had read the reviews, but I was a dumb ---. I thought how bad could it really be? After all there were 2 good reviews most recently.OK no. I should have heeded the previous reviews. The place was absolutely the most horrid thing I have ever seen. Even through my so-called rose colored glasses. Mold was growing on the inside of the windows and up the walls! How does that happen? Razor wire in the parking lot, the lanterns in the entrance were hanging askew. How hard is it to take a screwdriver and fix that? Broken marble in the lobby, filthy walls, bathroom had some kind of hair all in the tub and on the sink counter. Who stayed there the night before, Bigfoot? Ok ladies I know you would not like this place. Guys??? Well 99% of you wouldn't either but I was raised with 5 boys so I know about that other 1% of you. You'd shrug and think whatever, but I also know that you would not even think of taking your lady there. I consider myself to be a pretty tough girl, with a famine twist ;0) But I'm sorry. Even impaired where I was like that 1% of you guys out there, I just couldn't stay in this place. I couldn't even lock my door. Now what kind of craziness would that have been if I ended up next to some strange homeless man? The lady at the desk told me that on cold nights they allow the homeless who are sitting in the parking lot come in the lobby to get out of the cold. With a room that had no real way to secure my door, and having been advised when I asked to change rooms that all the rooms were like that. I just couldn鈥檛 hang with it. I had to beat feet out of that place. I'm glad they are looking out for the homeless, but maybe they should apply for some aide and make that a homeless shelter. As far as being a hotel, they aren't. There was another review I read that said if over half the reviews are bad don't stay. Listen to it. That person was right. People don't just write these reviews for their health. It's New Years Day and I could be doing allot of other things right now, but I am on this laptop warning others. Get the picture? Happy New Year everyone. Be Safe and let's all have hope for the new year ahead."

This is my first time returning to this hotel since it was updated and remodeled. Was very impressed. New flat panel TVs, and decor are very hip and trendy.

All of the staff was super friendly and professional, a refreshing change to see so many smiling faces! Check in was perfect and room was exactly as requested...high floor, end of hall facing downtown. Room was spotless (yes, even behind the headboard!) and newly renovated. Two room suite with mini fridge micro, sink. Nice bathroom with doors from both the living room and from the bedroom. Bedroom was a touch small but not a problem. Lovely balcony off of bedroom with great Dallas skyline view. Indoor/outdoor Pool area was really nice and pool was warm. We will be back for sure!"
"Review_14292","hotel_197","hotel_8914","Jul 23, 2008","Nice hotel - great renovations The hotel is still in the process of being remodeled. When I checked in, all the rooms are done however there is some furniture missing (a few end tables), artwork, etc. from the room but nothing you would need to stay there. A letter on the desk states that these items are on the way from overseas. The rooms are beautiful. New carpets, drapes, fixtures, granite top countertops in bar area and bathroom. Good neutral colors - contemporary earth tones. The cooling system is great. NO wall unit and that counts a lot for me. The air comes through vents near the ceiling. As the other reviews have suggested, there are 2 flat screen TV's that are literally across the wall from each other. one in the bedroom and one in the main part of the suite. There is a small refrig. in my room. The beds are nice - very comfortable. The bedroom is small, but not impossible to get around in. I'm a big guy, 6'4 and 300 lbs, and I didn't have a problem so that puts most others under me in being able to get around in a small space. Bathroom is very modern and fairly spacious.For the negatives - you pay $7.95 a night for parking. WHY? I don't get it... there is a sign at the front desk that states don't leave valuables in the car, which is something you should never do. It also says there have been break-ins in the immediate area. If you pay for parking, and this is not a garage with a monitored gate...then what is the parking fee for if there is no security? What does the customer get for their money here? Also, you must pay $10 a night for Internet service. Come on...most places offer it for free. Its Wayport so you know you don't have trouble connecting which is a good thing since some places (many in fact) offer free Internet that a lot of the times is DOWN.I don't like the nickel and diming...but if its for a good reason such as security to park your car, I really don't mind paying for parking. Enjoy your stay here, its going to be a nice place in 3 months or so. I got a rate here for $50 a night on Priceline but that may not last for too much longer when the hotel is completely done."
"Review_14293","hotel_197","hotel_7185","Jul 15, 2008","Very Nice Renovations I read many negative reviews about this hotel after having booked it for our vacation, so I was anxious about what I might find. I had also known it was under renovation and was scheduled to be completed by July 2008. We arrived late in the evening July 3 and the lobby was being painted, obviously to avoid inconvenience of customers, but this made me a bit more anxious. The man at the front desk very friendly and speedy. When I got to the door of our room, I was still anxious not knowing what to expect, but was very surprised to see a room that looked brand new. It was modern, stylish and clean. It was equipped with two flat screen televisions a new sofa-bed and of course the famous Sweet Sleeper bed. I was very impressed and would definately stay here again.If you have seen the negative reviews, the hotel must have been in sad shape before they renovated it. It must be an entirely different hotel, now, and I would recommend it to anyone.Took some pictures to post, I will try to get them uploaded soon."
"Review_14294","hotel_197","hotel_1818","Jul 10, 2008","Much better than reviews suggest I also stayed at this hotel during the Girls JO's. I would assume, based on the previous reviews that this hotel had been mismanaged and not taken care of. I can say with all sincerity, that if you were to stay at the hotel again, you would see night and day differences. I was extremely apprehensive about staying at this hotel after reading previous reviews. As you will see in my other reviews, I am brutally honest with my comments. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying close to downtown Dallas. Please keep in mind, they are still remodeling, so there are some issues with that, but nothing that interrupted my stay.Pros-Location, location, location! Very close to downtown and an easy drive also. Easy back roads to get downtown when the interstate is backed up.-Clean rooms, hallways, laundry facility, workout facility and dining facility-Food from restaurant was very good (breakfast buffet in the mornings and a club croissant sandwich a couple of times)-Stayed in a King Suite. Rooms were large. 2 LG LCD flat screen monitors. Bedroom was tight, but living room area was large and allowed for a lot of space. Easy to spread out with a laptop. Wet bar was a nice touch also.-Pool looked clean but I didn't jump in.-Staff was negotiable on check out time and seemed courteous with other folks in our groupCons-Pay $9.95 for 24hrs of wireless. I have stayed in 2 star hotels with free wireless. (Business center was one computer in a cubby hole in the lobby. Signs posted makes it look like they are still revamping the business center)-Was told $2 flat rate for calls out on toll free numbers (had a conference call). Ended up getting charged for $17 or so.-Each room has a little ledge to walk out on, railing in our room looked like it was ready to fall off. I jiggled it and it almost did! I don't have little ones, but something to keep in mind-The main bedroom was tight. But nothing you can't handle-Walls were quite thin. I could hear our neighbors discussions at 1 AM"

I must say that from some of the previous reviews that have been posted, I too would not be pleased with my stay. But with that said, my stay was wonderful. Our family of 3 was at this hotel for 6 nights, while attending the Girls Junior Olympics Volleyball Championships. The hotel arranged a customized website for our group to book our hotel rooms. We were offered several benefits that eliminated some of the complaints of other reviewers. The hotel was easy to find, travelling from DFW. The hotels exterior was pleasant and the parking lot was large, clean and appeared as safe as possible. Plenty of lighting at night. It is conveniently located, just a short drive to downtown Dallas. Using either the freeway or Market Center Blvd to make your way to the city center. The front desk clerks were very pleasant and very helpful. I believe that the hotel should be done with the construction very soon. They were finishing construction on the area at the front of the restaurant and the workout room by the pool. I did not notice any construction on any of the floors that I visited. The hotels front desk area, elevators and hallways to our room were clean. Our room was fantastic. Probably one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. A large comfortable bed and the couches pull out bed was even comfortable. There was a large flat screen tv in each room. Both tvs worked great and were the best tvs I have ever had in any hotel room. The rest of the room was very nice and pleasant. The 6 nights we stayed there were great and our time spent in the room was comfortable. The main bedroom was a bit cramped with the door opening in towards the bedroom, but it is nothing you cant deal with. It was just a very nice, comfortable room for the 3 of us. We did have a room on the noisy side of the hotel, facing the freeway. But while travelling we all sleep using earplugs, so the freeway noise was not a problem. But I could see how that may affect many guests. The hotel supplied our group with a buffet breakfast each morning. The breakfast was delicous and very satisfying. We did not have the need to visit the hotels restaurant or bar. The workout room equiptment was very nice. The room itself was in the final stages or construction. The indoor/outdoor pool was nice, along with the indoor whirlpool. The hotels computer and printer was very helpful. I did not bring a laptop, as I certainly did not want to pay for internet service from my room. They really need to provide free wireless internet hookup. Our arranged group rate per night was very reasonable. I certainly can not complain about that. The hotel has a shuttle van available to its guests. I believe the van is available for locations within a couple of miles from the hotel. (3 miles perhaps?) Overall it was a great place to stay and I would stay here again if I had the chance."
"Review_14296","hotel_197","hotel_4668","Jun 2, 2008","Ridiculous Hidden Charges for an OK place I recently stayed at this hotel while attending an event at the World Trade Center. This hotel is overpriced and over rated for the services and facilities rendered and should not be considered if you are traveling to attend any of the Dallas markets. If you want to overpay for a cramped bedroom chopped into a suite of 2 mini-rooms, pay $10/day for Internet access, pay $8/day to park in an open parking lot, (a charge not disclosed in the reservation process) pay for LOCAL telephone calls, and eat mediocre over-priced food, go for it. There are 10-15 other brand name hotels within a 3-mile radius that are better value for your hard-earned money. See my review of the nearby Holiday Inn Dallas Market Center.When I drove up to the hotel, I thought it was closed as it is under renovation. There was no front door staff or bellman on duty at the door, so I dragged my bag across the open parking lot myself. I stepped to the counter to check in, handed over my credit card and Starwood Preferred Guest card to one of the two employees. One was helping another guest try to locate a Federal Express package, and after beginning my registration, the person helping me stopped to assist her co-worker look for the Fed-x package, keeping me standing, watching, waiting while they fumbled around and didn鈥檛 find the package. My room was on the 11th floor, the SPG floor, but the lounge where I was looking forward to relaxing with complimentary evening appetizers and a glass of wine was closed for renovation. If it were my hotel, I would comp similar services somewhere in the hotel or provide an SPG coupon of some sort, but no such offer was made. My newly renovated room had a large sitting area with a granite topped bar, table desk, sofa and flat screen TV that was a total invasion of necessary space in the bedroom which was way too small for comfort. The bedroom was consumed by its king size bed that was so large that when the door between the bedroom and sitting room was open, you could not walk by the bed to the open closet area. A second flat screen TV was tucked in the corner, but it was somehow positioned requiring that you sit up and carefully point the remote at the exact perfect spot to change channels. The 2 TV鈥檚 were literally 1 foot apart, each on one side of the wall between the 2 rooms鈥omething so silly that could have been remedied by making the opening between the 2 rooms a niche where the TV could swivel and be viewed from either side. The division of the room into 2 rooms just made the whole thing seem cramped. Since there was no space in the bedroom to open your suitcase, so you actually had to use the sitting room as part of the 鈥減rivate鈥?space normally reserved for the bedroom of a suite. What was the idea of this design? Dinner in the hotel was another story. The menu is from the 80鈥檚, and so was the food preparation. I ordered what I thought was the healthiest meal, fettuccini with grilled shrimp, but it arrived swimming in oil. The servers were really friendly, but not trained to simply look at the table and determine what was needed, so I sat with an empty water glass and finished my meal without a coffee at the end as the server never offered either. I mentioned this on the comment card on my departure and was surprised that the Food Operations Manager immediately acknowledged my comments in an email. For my money...I'm not returning."

I was in a renovated room, and they needed to start over. The bed was terrible, and probably 30 years old (Taco Bed). They charge $9 for parking, $10 for the internet, and $4.00 for bottled water. The Best thing in the Hotel was the hot Bar Tender. The exercise room was in an old guest room. You had to walk through the parking lot to get to the pool. The most exciting part of my stay was the women stuck in one of the elevators screaming for someone to let her out. After smiling a little bit and celebrating that it was not me in there I went back to my room. I was shocked to find the women still crying historically from the elevator nearly 45 minutes later when I went back down. If you need a cheap place to stay on a weekend in Dallas when everything else is over priced this is it, but remember you are risking your life staying in this falling apart death trap of a hotel."
"Review_14298","hotel_197","hotel_9321","Apr 19, 2008","Skip Until July 2008 After the Renovation Got a good deal on Priceline, but Priceline doesn't advise you the hotel is under renovation (a badly needed renovation, as pointed out numerous times in these reviews.) I've stayed here many times, and prefer this hotel due to it's convenient location with access to IH-35E, Market Center Blvd, Harry Hines, etc. The TV sets are OLD - the color is really bad on them. Even though I'm a Starwood Gold member, I got a hotel next to an elevator lobby, and had to listen to crowds come and go through the night. The hotel often hosts wedding parties and such on weekends. Renovation work generally kicks off at 9am, til 6 or 7pm and they were nice enough to book me on the 4th floor, while the 5th floor is being renovated. If you don't spend a lot of time in your room during the day, you won't be inconvenienced. For me, I had to spend a good amount of time trying to recover from a stomach ailment, and was able to get NO rest because of the hammering and drilling all day. Had I known this place was under renovation, I'd have gladly paid more to get any other hotel in the Market Center area, even the ghetto Raddisson. By the time you add $18 daily for internet and for parking, you're better off at someplace like Courtyard that has FREE internet. There's no desk - there's this round table from the 1970's (which was encrusted with some kind of food items until I cleaned it off) with two rickety chairs. I'd think a hotel like this would cater to business travellers and have a desk with a REAL office chair."

Having read the negative reviews, I was apprehensive about what I would find. At check-in I mentioned that I had read on the internet some unflattering things about the hotel and I asked for a good room. There are somethings I didn't like, but basically it is an average 3 star hotel. It does need refurbishing; and this has already started. (I recently stayed at a brand new hotel and there are differences between brand new and needing refurbishing.) However, there wasn't anything unacceptable about my room. Housekeeping appears to be doing a good job. My room was clean. I didn't see any mold or mildew on the walls and the wall covering was intact.  Registration was professional and courteous. The public spaces are pleasant and inviting.To me, the biggest distraction was the carpet in the corridor. It was loose and wrinkled. The Televisions (one in the Living Room and one in the Bed Room) are old tube type sets. The color was terrible; the orange color glowed."

I would rather stay at a serial killer motel! In the first room I was given, the lights didn't work, and I could see mold growing on the walls. The wallpaper was peeling and moldy from water damage. I asked to be moved, and I was moved to a room just as bad. The room smelled of mold, and you could see the mold growing near the windows. The curtains conveniently hid the mold. The vents all had mold growing out of them. There were stains all over the floor, and water damage everywhere. The couch and chairs were all stained as well. I bought Lysol and an air freshener at the store, but that did nothing to get rid of the smell. I was physically sick while staying here. 15 people left and went to another hotel, and it was the best move I've ever made. Towards the end of the training, the horror stories from the Sheraton Suites continued. People came in to training and their clothing smelled like mold. One person had mold growing on their clothes that they had put in their closet. A few people talked about ants in their room, and one person said they woke up with ants all over their body. I wouldn't wish this hotel on my worst enemy. Avoid this hotel at all costs!!!!!"
"Review_14302","hotel_197","hotel_8775","Feb 8, 2008","Needs a big renovation.. now! Good location since it's right off of I-35 and Market Ctr Blvd. Everything other than that seems to be below par for the Sheraton brand name.Rooms are all suites and very small. With the king size bed in the room, you can literally extend your arm and touch all 4 walls. The televisions don't seem to have been updated since 1980s. They are in working condition and that's just about it. The furniture in the room seems to be at least a decade old, if not more and it really shows with chips in the paint etc.The bathroom is equally old and the bath tubs have chips all over. The amenities weren't any known brand.The only saving grace is that the room and bathroom is kept relatively clean. There is Starbucks coffee in the room and a refrigerator with a mini bar. However, don't dare look around the fridge or under the sink.The fitness center on the ground level will remind you of Norman Bates Motel and has an extremely eerie feeling. The lighting is dim. The little equipment and weights there is - seem to be from the 1960s and very rusty/squeaky. The false ceiling is falling apart and with the pool right next to this fitness center, the dampness was very uncomfortable.The top two or three levels I think are club floors and if you are a an elite SPG member, do try to push the staff for an upgrade to that level. The small dining room on the top level has a small limited complimentary breakfast, but enough to get you full.The restaurant on the ground level is decent and has the regular buffet, lunch and dinner offerings.The staff at the hotel is courteous.Parking... this is another quirk. Why are they charging 7 bucks? This is not a downtown hotel and none of the adjoining hotels including Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Doubletree have parking fee. This hotel shares its parking lot with Courtyard. There is no additional security or restricted access to the parking, so I don't know why they should be charging a fee.A very disappointing hotel in the Starwood chain. If this were my first experience with Sheraton, I would never stay at another Sheraton again in my life. But I know that this hotel is an anomaly in the Starwood chain."

Dallas, as a city, is very spread out so there is really no hotel with a central location. Watch out for hotels that claim that!We arrived to found our room already assigned and were on our way very quickly. All rooms here are suites. We had a living room, bedroom and a large bathroom. There is also a kitchenette of sorts by the door with coffee maker and microwave. The living room also featured a large desk.Curiously, there are small balconies which can be reached by a sliding door by the bedroom. Two people can stand out there by why it was even included is a mystery. There is no room to sit and the only thing it appears handy for is smoking.Anyway, the room was well maintained and the bed very comfortable as always at a Sheraton. There was a small t.v. in the bedroom and a larger one in the living room. Curiously, they are positioned back to back to if you use the remote to change the channel, it will also change the channel of the other one! We got a good laugh out of that and whoever planned the rooms should be reassigned.There is a restaurant in the lobby but we never ate there. The exception being the bar which serves burgers, sandwiches and snacks. We had planned to eat at the lobby restaurant but, curiously, found it closed and it was a Saturday night. We didn鈥檛 feel like driving so we tried the bar. The food was actually very good and the prices not bad. For breakfast, there is a Denny鈥檚 a quick walk away. You鈥檒l find that much cheaper than at the hotel.The hotel is right on the highway making various points in Dallas easily reachable. The airport is about a 20 minute drive. Traffic can be very bad in Dallas so if you need to be somehwere, give yourself some exra time. However, other than the Denny鈥檚 and the lobby restaurant, there are no places to eat within walking distance. You鈥檒l need a car but a short drive will give you plenty of places to choose from. The lobby staff also made some great recommendations and are very helpful. You are also close to several malls as well.The hotel is in an office complex. It appears designed for business travelers as during our weekend stay, the place was quiet and seemed pretty empty.The housekeeping crew did a great job and the staff we encountered were very friendly and willing to assist. Overall, a nice stay and I would recommend this place."

The hotel looks good from the outside but show big signs of wear and tear on the inside. The first thing when arriving you are told it is $7.00 per night to park in the open parking lot. That is an extreme way to squeeze every dime out of someone. I was in room 215 and on arrival the smell of stale smoke in the room was extensive. There were beer cans in the trash can from the previous guest and the vacuum must have been broken that day because the floor was not clean. The plumber got the hot/cold water backwards on the bathroom sink so after waiting for some time for the hot water I realized it was backwards. The room was nice and big with two TV's. Unfortunately every picture on both televisions made the subjects look sunburned they were so red. And there was no remote for either set. Waking up early was not an option because of the rattling pipes that sounded like they ran between the box springs and matress. The wallpaper was coming off the wall but the heater darn sure worked! In the defense of the hotel, there was a letter on the elevator explaining renovations were about to begin. Would I stay there again? For 50 bucks a night I would, but for 150 a night they better throw in dancing girls and open bar! When staying at a hotel make certain the clock by the bed is set correctly and the alarm is not on to hurry you out the door in the morning. I have noticed this practice by hotel maids more and more in the last could of years."

Its attached to a shopping mall (no problems with that) but there is no intimacy. Like I say, excellent hotel with great facilities, but glad it was a business stay rather than a romantic getaway. Other than that well above average.I would say breakfast is a little pricey though."

The staff was very friendly and had a house divided theme going for the TX OU weekend. The gym is very nice. It is an updated Westin Workout Gym. I was comfortable in the room. The AC worked... there were no problems at all. The hotel is located in the Galleria and that made it nice for quick trips for shopping and for breakfast. Its not easy to walk to other places around the area. But Dallas in general is not very pedestrian friendly."

Truth is, Downtown Dallas is * ahem * a tad gritty. The Westin Galleria is in a commercial, but upscale area. I felt 100% safe. Downtown has a criminal court, probation center and other cheery municipal buildings. The Galleria is about 15-20 minutes North. My only gripes with the room are that the Heavenly Bed is too . . . poofy. Lots of sheets and pillows. The A/C was a little hard to regulate (Room 921) but not a too-doo. Free coffee in the lobby. Con: gone well before 7 a.m. Nice gym. Fast elevators. Desk service: eh, but not insulting or mean. Just a bit daffy."

We have stayed here dozens of times from the late 90's. Have not been here in a couple of years now(since their renovation in '07). In years past, the property was always clean, comfortable, and a reasonable value for its class. I now consider this hotel one of my least desirable choices if I were to need to stay in Dallas. Upon check-in, I casually mentioned about my spouse looking forward to a soak in the tub...the agent informed me that there are no longer bath tubs in ANY King bedded rooms in the Hotel...I am serious!!! We were on one of the frequent guest floors; the new carpet is in terrible shape; the heavenly bed sheets felt like sandpaper. I can't help but think Starwood has let this property go because of cost cutting measures. For $ 299 a night, I will have to take my business to a newer, comfortable property. Goodbye to an old friend with lots of good memories, but you will never see me again."
"Review_14310","hotel_198","hotel_9429","Aug 29, 2008","Horrible experience here; avoid at all costs I have stayed at many Westin hotels and never had a problem before the Westin Dallas (Galleria). Westin claims there is a refrigerator in EVERY room. They are only half right. All conventional refrigerators were replaced with REFRESHMENT VENDING REFRIGERATORS. These are like refrigerators, but if you even touch any item inside then you will be charged (since it calculates by weight and automatically bills the room). There is a sign that informs you of this and says conventional refrigerators are available by calling room service. I called room service only to find out they were all being used (I doubt they even have any). The GUEST SERVICES attendant said you can just use the vending refrigerator in your room, but be sure to call the front desk each time you move something so you won't get billed for it, since it's done by weight. In short, THEY WANTED ME TO CALL THE FRONT DESK EACH TIME I TOOK A SIP OF MILK AND PUT IT BACK IN THE REFRIGERATOR. Also, they charge $10 per day for internet and it didn't work half the time. I spoke to the front desk lady who said, here is the 800 number for tech support, you will need to call them to report it being down. APPARENTLY, IT WAS MY JOB TO BE THE IN-HOUSE TECH SUPPORT GUY.The hotel itself was under construction the whole time and had rude staff members.Summary:-RUDE STAFF-EXPECT YOU TO REPORT EACH WEIGHT CHANGE IN THE FRIDGE-CHARGE $10 PER DAY FOR INTERNET THAT DOESN'T WORK-EXPECT YOU TO HELP THEM FIX THE BROKEN INTERNET-OVERPRICEDDo not stay at this hotel."

"Review_14312","hotel_198","hotel_1884","Aug 10, 2008","Beautiful Renovation! We travel to the Dallas area frequently but had never stayed at this particular hotel mainly because it was listed so far down on the list of favorites on this site. I'm so glad we tried it. I arrived after a 300 mile drive a bit after noon and the valet told me he was sure I would be able to go ahead and check in, but when questioned he admitted to me I would probably receive a better room if I could wait till a bit later to check in. He then directed me to where I could park and my daughter and I followed his advice and left to explore the American Girl store and Bistro for a couple of hours.When we pulled back around to the valet the same extremely helpful employee greeted us and asked my daughter if she had enjoyed her experience at American Girl and cheerfully unloaded my car onto a bellman cart for me.We were able to check in quickly and were given a room on the 17th floor. We opened the door to a very spacious two queen bedded room. The room also included a very nice window seat with a view that looked over the busy traffic of the tollway below. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated in a modern decor with a plasma TV and ample electrical outlets for cellphone chargers etc. The Heavenly bed Westin offers was indeed heavenly as always. The bathroom had a very unique door as it was a large sliding frosted glass door with a green tint to it in keeping with the modern furnishings. We were back to school shopping and this hotel couldn't have been more perfect for our purpose since the Galleria Mall is literally a few steps from the elevator. We were able to make frequent trips back and forth to deposit heavy bags to our room with some stores even offering us assistance to deliver our bags to our room for us. Although I did notice there was still construction taking place when I was in front of the hotel, I was never bothered with any kind of noise. I did not explore the pool area as I had read on their website that it was still undergoing work.All of the staff at this hotel were all extremely pleasant and helpful to my 9 year old daughter and myself. We will more than likely reserve a room here next time we come to the city to shop."
"Review_14313","hotel_198","hotel_5207","Jul 24, 2008","Caution-Under Construction Stayed here for one night on business January 23rd. I had no idea (nor was informed) the hotel was under construction. After checking in around 10 PM, I sat down to rest in the 2nd floor lounge area. Shortly after sitting down, a crew of no less then 75 construction workers are filing up the escalator lugging all sorts of equipment and pieces of scaffolding which they proceed to set up in an area adjacent the second floor elevators. Are you kidding me? I am paying $269 for about 8 hours in my room, and I need to see this?The pool is apparently under renovation, as are many spots in the interior, as well the front entrance. This should have been disclosed. Needless to say, I was not happy. To top it all off, the next morning, well before 7AM, I was awoken to the extremely loud noise of power equipment and concrete saws from the lower floors. How is this possibly acceptable?Either you shut down the hotel until the repairs are completed, or you let the rooms go at $100 a night with the caveat that you will be on an active construction site. The rooms are beautiful, and this will have the potential to be a fine hotel. However, as a longtime Starwood member, I was not pleased with this stay."

"Review_14315","hotel_198","hotel_10452","May 22, 2008","Excellent service and wonderful stay! I recently stayed at the Westin Galleria Dallas three nights for a conference and had a wonderful, stress-free stay. The hotel has undergone a major renovation, though many of its common rooms are still in the process of being renovated. Overall, the look is sleek and modern, and the hotel seamlessly fits into its location as part of the Galleria. The front staff was excellent, and I had no problems checking in. In fact, after checking into my original room (10th floor), I requested the front desk to move me to a higher room (15th floor) facing away from the highway, and my needs were promptly met. The concierge was also fantastic and spent a lot of time helping me plan my free time away from the conference (Northpark Mall, Grapevine Mills, Dallas Arboretum, etc.)The room itself was nothing less than what I expected from a Westin hotel: spacious, immaculate and comfortable with a modern finish (flat-screen TV, mini bar and safe all included). The bed was very comfortable, and I loved the double headed shower in the bathroom. The room was quiet, and I did not have any noise problems during my stay. I also enjoyed the small touches throughout the hotel. On each floor by the elevator, a bowl of fresh fruit and copies of the daily newspaper are available to take. The Galleria mall is accessible from the 1st and 2nd floors of the hotel, and I loved the option of dropping my shopping bags off to my room when they got too heavy and then coming back down to continue shopping. While the Dallas Galleria is smaller than the one in Houston, it's still a nice place to go shopping and people watching, with a large ice rink in the center.For dining options, the Oceanaire seafood restaurant is located on the first floor of the hotel, whereas other options such as Grand Lux Cafe are located within the Galleria mall proper. The location of the hotel is also fairly central - it took me 15-20 minutes to drive downtown and the same amount of time to drive to the DFW airport. On the down side, the hotel charges a steep, daily fee for internet usage, and currently, there is no hotel restaurant where you can charge directly to your room. Overall, the Westin Galleria Dallas is a great business/conference hotel and a good bet for those visitors wanting to do some serious shopping."

Our first room was on the 14th floor . The first 2 days can麓t sleep until the childrens staying exactly in the upper floor stay in calm (stop runing until 11pm ) , you can hear when the people are walking in the upper floor. The 4th day we have to ask for a change of room because our room have a door conecting to the next room and we can here all what the other people talk. our new room was on the 16th floor with no conecting door but the noise of the construction on the upper floors begins at 8am. I麓m not a very picky person at all, and usually i can handle very well this situations (noise), but this is the worst hotel in acoustic and noise reduction that i ever stayed in his class.The door at the bathroom is only a foged crystal without lock, if you like privacy at bathroom this is not for you. The galleria is far better in houston, the galleria at dallas is half of the size of the galleria at houston and the prices are expensive.The food at the Oceanaire was very good also the Grill at galleria and The grand lux cafe, if you like a good mall with better selection than galleria try the Northpark , and if you want the best prices at one of the best outlets in dallas try Grapevine."

The doormen and front desk staff were very nice and helpful. No problems getting taxis from the hotel. It does have an outdoor pool, but I didn't have time to use it. For being in a mall though I was surprised by the hotel's dinky gift shop...the only place to pick up a snack after the mall closes.

The bathroom door is a frosted glass door that does not lock so when you go in and turn the light on, your shadow can be seen by anyone that walks by - very uncomfortable feeling for my wife and sister.

I was initially a little skeptical about staying in Brooklyn as I've been to New York before and have always stayed in hotels in Manhattan. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how close it really is. I'm a Londoner and am accustomed to getting on the underground to travel to places, so it really wasn't a big deal for me to get on a train to get to Manhattan. The location was amazing - it was just a few minutes away from over 6 different train lines which meant that you could get to anywhere in Manhattan with ease. The hotel itself was pleasant enough - good sized rooms, clean, helpful staff. The restaurant didn't look very good so I never ate there, but with Manhattan just a few minutes away, I don't really see the need to eat at a hotel restaurant. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. If you're looking for a decent mid price hotel that's accessible, then this one fits the bill."

We stayed at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott for one night before boarding a cruise out of Brooklyn. We booked directly through the Marriott's website many months before and secured a favorable rate using the Senior discount.Arrived around 3 PM and had no problem checking in early. The front desk staff were both professional and friendly. After check-in we moved to the bar for a couple of drinks and found this to be a fun place. The bartender, Michael, makes a great Manhattan!Talked with the doorman, Nick, who recommended a great dinner spot - the Queen Italian Restuarant. There was 6 of us and he had no problem arranging transportation for our ride there.After dinner we returned to the Marriott for coffee and dessert. They serve Starbucks and a wicked cheesecake sampler platter ($13) which easily fed us all - we may not have finished it all! Great attentive service as well.The rooms were clean and comfortable and good sized. The bed was very comfy. Very large bathroom and lots of hot water and pressure in the morning.The hotel itself is very lovely. There are escalators from the main entrance up to the lobby and they are surrounded by lots of greenery and flowers. Security is also very evident and appreciated.We enjoyed a great breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant. A buffet is offered in addition to the regular menu. Portions were huge and I'm not sure any of us were able to finish. Service was extremely friendly but a little slow.As this was a quick trip we were not able to enjoy the pool - hopefully we will on our next trip, as we are staying here again next May.To sum it up we had a great stay and look forward to the next one!Transportation notes: there were 4 of us traveling from JFK with at least 8 bags. We arranged to have Arecibo pick us up - the fee to the hotel was $50 plus tip. Our doorman, Nick, arranged our transportation to the port and that was $25 plus tip."

We have stayed at this hotel several times this year and always received the same terrific service. The rooms are very comfortable and most often we have been given rooms with a great view of the city and concierge level access. All of the staff with whom we interacted- the doormen, the check-in staff, the concierge, the parking attendants, the fitness room attendant are friendly, courteous and helpful. On a recent stay when we checked in early we were put in a room we didn't care for. When we asked for a room change for the next day, we were immediately moved. This was all done quickly and pleasantly, with no hesitation.A full breakfast is available in the concierge room on weekdays. It offers more than just the usual continental breakfast fare, along with outdoor balconies offering tremendous views of Manhattan. The staff are welcoming and friendly to all. The late afternoon snacks and evening desserts are especially tasty.Finally another bonus when staying at this hotel is the charming Brooklyn neighborhood of brownstones and the Promenade which is a short walk from the hotel. It has a breathtaking view of the city at night and lovely shops and restaurants nearby.After a quick cab ride into Manhattan for an evening of dining , shopping or theater , you return to a quiet retreat away from the bustle and crowds of the city . We continue to enjoy our stays here."

The hotel itself is fantastic, the staff are friendly, the rooms are huge and clean with a nice bar\restaurant to relax in.

But while my room had a nice flat screen TV it wasn't worth much without a good signal. I called the desk and they said the problem was due to the weather conditions. I found out later after visiting a relative's room that their TV was working just fine.My issues with service started when I pulled up to the hotel driveway. I had two parties in my car and all of the luggage was taken to one room even though I explained to the bellman that we had two separate reservations. We gave him both of our names. I had to go to the north building to retrieve my luggage and bring it to my room in the south building.I asked the bellman what I needed to do to park my car. He said to pull into the garage and follow the sign for hotel guests. The attendant inside just pointed me down to the lower level. I've never seen a more confusing hotel garage. Everything was roped off and I couldn't find any anyone until I got to the bottom level. I was eventually able to park but when I checked in I told the desk person that I had a parking ticket. Either she didn't understand me or she was insulted that I didn't let her finish her spiel but I had to ask again at check out for them to put the parking on my bill so I would be able to leave the garage. When I tried to leave the garage the parking attendents weren't sure what to do to get me out of the garage. It took them three tries to get the gate opened for me. I really wanted to like this hotel because the rooms were nice. But the service was weak and I expected much more for the money I paid."

The hotel is very nice, and the rooms were great. The bedding was high quality and the toiletries and toilet paper were as well. The service was very friendly and responsive, and the Sunday brunch was delicious. The price was comparable to a Manhattan hotel, and the hotel on a rather busy downtown Brooklyn street. I lived in Brooklyn for four years, so I'm very much pro-Brooklyn, but if you had business in Manhattan this hotel would be rather inconvenient. Cabs were plentiful at the hotel, and there is a subway nearby, but you have to walk a bit to get to any of the quaint Brooklyn Heights shopping and restaurants.

The concierge lounge on the 23rd floor was a big plus. The view was spectacular! The subway was a short distance away which made getting to Manhattan very easy. There were also many good restaurants within walking distance and the area felt very safe. I would definitely recommend this hotel."

I spent one night at the marriot brooklyn Bridge and I loved it.The room we had was huge and nicely furnished with a nice red chaise.The hotel itself was clean and new.The location is great if you re a Brooklyn lover : you ll stay in Brooklyn heights.Really close to Fulton street mall where you can find the really cool pair of Nike Dunk you ve always been looking for:)Anyway, the hotel is also really convenient for tourists who want to visit Manhattan.the closest metro station is 5/10 minutes walk so you may want to consider that.But you ll be walking in NYC anyway..Compared to the outrageous price they charge in Manhattan the marriot bkn is a great deal. i m sure a room like this in manhattan would go for $600.The gym was nice and clean too.Bad thing you have to pay for inernet (like in Manhattan)"

Right over the Brooklyn Bridge from lower Manhattan (you can walk over the bridge to Little Italy and Chinatown or its cheap cab fare).Beautiful building, rooms and location. You can walk to Court Street where there are dozens of new restaurants.Service is superb and the prices are less than equivalent hotels across the river.Excellent pool and health club with a nice bar and Achieves resuranunt in the building.Summer there's a farmers market one half block away.We formally stayed in lower Manhattan when visiting our daughter but it's too easy to get to downtown from this place. This is a winner. Ask for a high floor in the new tower. Nice views.Any questions about Brooklyn? Ask for Janet in the lounge, she's wonderful and knows the city very well.General Manager is Sam Ibrahim, if you had a problem (which is hard to believe) he'd make it right."
"Review_14344","hotel_199","hotel_6413","Aug 20, 2008","Great Marriott Hotel for Business Travelers I ended up staying at the Marriott at Brooklyn Bridge this Past May. It was my third stay there in the past year. It is my favorite Marriott of the four in the area (others being Marquis in Time Square, Financial District near Wall St. and East Side). As a business traveler, I find the Marquis too crowded outside with tourist and the elevators take forever, East Side location is okay, rooms are small and a bit outdated (however that my have changed with recent renovations), and really don't care for Financial District Marriott for various reasons.Pros: Easy access to subway (2,3,4,5,M,R trains at Borough Hall a couple minutes walk; A,C,F at Jay Station across street in back of hotel. Great staff, friendly, never had any problems at all in my three stays. nice clean rooms, especially if you get a room in the expansion tower, Flat screen TV's with HD Channels. Huge Fitness area. My only gripe is the Health Club is not Marriott owned, and it closes at 10pm (I believe...maybe 11pm). Usually the Fitness Centers at most Marriotts are open 24/7. Side note: there also was construction going on one of the lower floors during the day (9am - 5pm only). It really have no affect on me since I was not there while it was going on. So if you are going to be staying in your room all day while you are in NYC, then yes, it may be an inconvienance. It may be over with by now.The concierge lounge, if you have access, is one of the nicer Marriott lounges. Free Wi-Fi access there, complimentary continental breakfast (fruit, cereal, eggs, pastries, yogurt, juices, bagels), complimentay soda (pepsi, diet pepsi, sierra mist, schwepps), water through out the day, complimentary Hors d'oeuvres in the evening and dessert (cookies, ice cream selection of cakes and pies). Honor Bar too for drinks in evening(think $5 for a drink, but may be wrong as I did not drink there).As far as internet goes, if $12.95 a night is too much you (it is for me), i signed up at boingo.com, which allows access at most Marriott hotels. It cost $21.95 a month (usually can signup at a reduced rate, like first two months for the price of one), works at a good amount of airports too...good deal compared to the alternative. It is worth while for me as I usually travel a week a month.I don't bother eating at Marriott's (unless I have a 2 for 1 dinner coupon). You are in NYC...besides of the convenience at eating there, you are only a quick subway to Chinatown/Little Italy and isn't too hard find a cheaper meal there. And i am sure the concierge at the front desk can direct you to a good restaurant too."

We went for Valentine's weekend, stayed two nights and loved it, took a run across the bridge and back, and relaxed in the whirlpool. the gym was pretty nice. Would highly recommend"
"Review_14346","hotel_199","hotel_8631","Aug 12, 2008","Mangment has a bad attitude For the outrageous price they charge per night, you'd expect some good customer service. I've never actually been yelled at by a manger before (or any staff member, for that matter), until I stayed here. I never once raised my voice, but she felt it was appropriate to tell me to be quiet so I could listen to what she was saying.I had billing issues, was awoken at 7:30-8:30 every morning by construction, didn't have my room cleaned every day, was lied to more than once by different staff members, and the list goes on and on.The location was good. Even though it was in Brooklyn it just took a few minutes on the subway to get to Manhattan. But that can't save it from the rudest staff as a whole I have ever encountered.They try to suck every penny out of you that they can, too. No packaged pasteries, even, for breakfast. Instead you can order their $19 (not kidding) bagel. Internet is $14 a day after tax. They charge for everything they can.I've had better customer service at Motel 6 and European youth hostels. I would never recommend this place to anyone unless they get a major staff overhaul."
"Review_14347","hotel_199","hotel_3511","Jul 16, 2008","Hey, Hyatt? Hilton? Come to Downtown Bklyn. Marriott Needs Competition I'll start by saying this is a nice, clean, comfortable hotel. You can't go wrong staying here. But I have a real problem with a hotel that gets stingy with its guests. Especially at $429 -- before taxes - a night. Remember, we're still in Brooklyn.That $429 will buy you a comfortable room and nothing more. You will pay for internet access.... why? Because they can charge it. In the Manhattan hotels I've stayed at, that access is free if you go to their business center. Not at the Bklyn Marriott. AND you will pay for breakfast. You will pay through the nose if you want that breakfast brought to your room. Consider this: After all the fees were added, including the 20% service charge ON TOP OF the $4.00 delivery charge, a $16 breakfast brought to the room (danish and coffeee) cost $26.60. Don't count on the service for that money, either. On two of the four nights we were there we needed to contact the front desk. There was no answer, and a trip downstairs revealed that the staff was overwhelmed with airline staff checking in (or out). A lot of flight attendants and pilots seem to stay there, but the staff appears to have trouble handling them all. We came home one night to find the down escalator operating, while the up escalator was out of service. With a maintenance key and simple press of a button, the down escalator could have been switched to carry guests up. But the staff didn't seem to care.I know NYC hotel prices are outrageous, especially in the summer, but if the Brooklyn Marriott had a little competition from other hotels, instead of being the only show in lower Brooklyn, I think they'd have to be kinder to their guests for that money. Until they are, I will try to avoid it whenver I can."
"Review_14348","hotel_199","hotel_7647","Jul 11, 2008","Fabulous Service-Brooklyn Marriott I am fortunate to stay in this hotel numerous times every month. The front desk staff, especially Beverly Brown, are welcoming the minute you approach them. The bellman Angelo and Terry are right there ready to assist with baggage, and this carries thru the entire visit. I want to share two recent experiences. Mathilde is the woman from houskeeping who brings the mints for your pillow. One evening as we chatted she was telling me about a medication that she was taking, but could not remember the name. the next evening along with the mint on my pillow, was a nice note in which she shared the information. Another time I lost a very expensive gold bracelet and Fadwa in the concirege lounge assisted me with recovering it thru lost and found. In short, in addition to being an excellent facility, the staff here goes way beyond what is necessary to make you feel welcome."

It is pricey, and that's its major drawback, but otherwise, the location is great. It is so close to Manhattan, yet it feels quieter. And it's right near a swanky street in Brooklyn Heights with inexpensive and great restaurants. I went to a wonderful thai place, and if I could remember the name, I'd totally recommend it. The beds were really comfy, and the room was a good size, especially for NYC! If you can afford it, I'd recommend staying here. I'd definitely stay again."

"Review_14352","hotel_199","hotel_9926","Jun 9, 2008","Okay, and debate if a Super 8 would have been just as good The main issue with this hotel is its overpriced even at a group discount rate, but that seems to be the norm with any hotel in a big city. For the price I would have liked a cleaner room. The main part was clean but the bathroom was a tad gross with makeup and I dont know what else wiped all over the door and the tile had dirt, grime and bacteria in several spots. Not to mention left over garbage from the prior guest still on the floor. The good things about this hotel is it has a large work out room and the staff was very friendly. Montague street is only a 5 min. walk and it has all kinds of restaurants on it. Select carefully where you eat though as there are several dirty dining places on this street. And unfortunately the Thai place I went to was shut down the next day by NYC health department. There is a great healthy market you can by all your meals at which I recommend. I also recommend taking the walk all the way down to the end of this street where you will see a view of the statue of liberty and the city. Do this at sunset as it is beautiful."

"Review_14354","hotel_199","hotel_3725","May 18, 2008","it was just fine. I stayed here for a girls' getaway weekend at the beginning of Sept. 2007. I'll be upfront and add that my friend used her Marriott points for our stay (and she still has about 90,000 left--THAT'S some business traveling).We arrived on a Thursday evening after a full work day and a 2 hour flight. But it's NYC, so when you get there, you have to take the bus to Manhattan, which drops you off around Times Square. But oh ha! We were staying in Brooklyn. We were told by someone--I think at this Marriott, but I'm not 100% sure on that--that we could get a taxi from Times Square to the Brooklyn Marriott for about $60. But oh ha again! As luck would have it, all the NYC taxi drivers were on strike, and so they were just charging whatever they felt like it that night. The first one we talked to wanted $70...per freaking person. This amused me to no end, because hello! It's New York, New York, where everything costs double, just like the name implies. My friend--a South African/British citizen just now getting accustomed to the ways and means of capitalist-no socialized healthcare-no free anything America--was aghast, but thankfully good at reading subway maps and somehow we got to where we were going via subway/bus. If she had written this review, the title would be That's Extortion! because she said this about every 10 minutes of our weekend stay.So. We got to the Marriott very, very tired. The front desk people were actually very nice--with a little nice, friendly chit chat (you angry reviewers who didn't get your rooms with the good views/good front desk service DO know that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, yes?) we were given a room on a floor way high up...maybe in the 20's? I don't remember. AND we had a spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge, which is beautiful at night when all lit up. Yet in a sadly, wistful, haunting kind of way, because of the spotlights that shine in memory of the World Trade Center.We used their gym once--she used the pool, I used a treadmill. No complaints here...to me, who is NOT a gym rat, a gym is a gym is a gym. And because of her chi chi high powered Marriott standing, she had access to their swanky business center that's on a floor which is off limits to the little people. But I did get to partake in their breakfast buffet backhandedly since she brought me down stuff--it looked like a good spread: eggs, bacon, fruit, yogurt, muffins. It does help to be nice to hotel employees AND have a frequent Marriott guest hook up. We were supposed to have a free welcome bucket of ice cream as part of the deal, but we got there so late the kitchen had closed. So they brought it the next day...while we were out getting blisters walking around Manhattan. Thus, it was melted by the time we got to it. But you know--they'd given us a room with a swank view and we didn't need the extra calories, so it was all good.Other than the great view, my favorite part of this room were the blackout curtains. Oh. My. God. Who invented these? Give that person a Nobel Peace Prize. After an exhausting afternoon/evening/night of travel, the next day I woke up and had no idea what time it was, but it didn't matter! I'd had the best sleep of my life. We had good, comfortable beds with good, comfortable pillows. The bathroom was decent, nice, and clean. I really don't know what some other reviewers' issues were with the toilet paper...is there a special standard for that stuff I don't know about? I don't know; I usually don't compare things like that, it seems a little, well, quite frankly, overly absorbed with certain bodily functions that make me start wanting to haul out my Freud reference materials.We never ate at the restaurant here--did they have one? We were too busy walking around the city. My friend is in love with rugby (or, conversely, just rugby players), so while I slept in the pitch black, heavenly room, she headed out early a lot to go figure out where we could catch some of those games and the front desk guy was always really sweet about waiting until at least 11 AM before calling the room to let me know she hadn't been kidnapped or mugged. They were also really helpful to us in printing out our boarding passes--somebody else here said they got charged for that, but we didn't.I've stayed in one other place in NYC--quite some time ago, so I forget the name of the place--and I have to say this is a very nice hotel. If you're a hotel snob, then maybe not for you...go check into the Four Seasons. But if you're an avid business traveller racking up the Marriott points (and/or a friend leeching off an avid business traveller), or you've got the extra money to spend on a really, really nice hotel in the NYC/Manhattan area, then I think you'll be just fine with this place.Tips (and this is for anywhere in the world you go, not just here):Bring your happy face and good attitude, and I bet you'll find that 9 out of 10 people in an establishment will be more than willing to try to accommodate your needs.Some things are worth getting snippy about, like a broken lock on a door...or a room teeming with cockroaches...or smelly souls loitering in the lobby and hallway areas. But toilet paper? Unless you have serious, bleeding hemorrhoids, I'd let that one go. Ditto for the pool temperature...it's a pool, not a bathtub. And there were some other nitpicky things I got a kick out of reading, but then I'm starting to nitpick on the nitpickers, and that's not cool I suppose.It's NYC. Bring good walking shoes. And dooooon't eat in Little Italy. They have really scary waiters that make single traveling women totally uncomfortable. Long story--but trust me on it."
"Review_14355","hotel_199","hotel_7301","May 14, 2008","Good service The Marriott was the chosen location for an international conference I was attending. It's an odd location, and feels very different to other parts of NYC. It's about a 20 min walk from the hotel to the start of the business/shopping district at the Manhattan side of the bridge, and around a $7 ride. We also travelled up-town to meet friends at the Plaza in the Park, which cost $20. Meanwhile a tube (subway) journey to Greenwich village took 20 mins and cost $4 rtn.Don't be fooled by the shopping in the area. The fact it has a Macy' around the corner, doesn't make this a smart part of town. That said, head up Montagu St (5 min walk) and you do find a few quieter streets, with older buildings with more character. There are some good restaurants up there too. At the end of the road are the Brooklyn Heights that overlook the river, bridge and the South/Eastern side of Manhattan island.As for the hotel itself, all staff were polite and very helpful. The rooms were large, smart, modern and clean.We only had conference food in the hotel, so I can't comment on overall food quality. They have an in-house Starbucks, but there are plenty of places within a 3 minute radius serving coffee/juices etc.There is a pool and gym - which looked enticing, but I didn't make it in there."

"Review_14357","hotel_199","hotel_1780","May 4, 2008","We enjoyed our stay immensely We tried something different for our latest Manhattan Trip. We stayed in Brooklyn and took the subway into Manhattan. We saved over 100 bucks a day on the room by staying at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott. The hotel is located near the subway (about 1 block). We were a little intimidated by the New York subway system at first, but soon felt comfortable taking it to the various sites we visited in Manhattan. Hopstop.com is a very useful website for navigating the subway. It gives very detailed directions for navigating between locations. WWW.MTA.INFO is another resource that can be used. The hotel is also a stop on the Grayline Tours loops. For around $40.00 you can get a 48 hr pass that will give you hop on/hop off access to the dozens of attractions on or near the tour bus/trolley stops that are on Grayline's routes. The hotel room was large and clean. I did scare myself a few times because of the placement of the mirrors in the room. I kept thinking a big ugly guy had made his way into the room until I got used to it. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. My daughter was especially impressed by the flat planel TV. The hotel restaurant was kind of pricy so we ate out. I purchased 48 hour New York Passes for each of us which gave us access to a pile of Manhattan attractions without having to wait in long lines. We were able to see many more things with the time we saved. All in all we loved the experience, but if you're going to be visiting spots mainly in Manhattan as we do, you might want to opt for the conveniece of staying at one of the Manhattan hotels."
"Review_14358","hotel_199","hotel_9574","Apr 29, 2008","Fantastic! Our son chose this hotel for the out of town guests traveling to his wedding in Brooklyn. The guests occupied a total of 12 rooms. He could not have made a better choice for us! Everyone was thoroughly pleased with their accommodations. The rooms are extremely spacious, well appointed, and very clean. The beds, bed linens and pillows were so comfortable. It was great having a small sitting area with couch (which also opened up to a full size bed), wide screen tv, safe, small refrigerator, and coffee maker in the room. We were too busy to use the pool or fitness room, but several family members did and really enjoyed themselves. Both check-in and out went extremely fast and everyone at the front desk was extremely gracious and accommodating. In fact, everyone working at the hotel went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Parking was simple and convenient, and we really appreciated not having to pay a fee every time we took the car in and out of the garage. Many of the guests took themselves on a walking tour of the neighborhood, over the Brooklyn Bridge, and to the wedding which was held at the nearby Brooklyn Historical Society. They all remarked at what a beautiful, safe area it was. The food at the hotel restaurant for lunch and breakfast was delicious and very reasonably priced. There were no complaints from any of the folks that traveled with us about anything! Now that we have found this beautiful gem of a place in Brooklyn, we will definitely stay here when visiting the city as it is an easy subway ride away from the bright lights and big city!"

"Review_14360","hotel_199","hotel_1051","Apr 8, 2008","Best in the Borough! Stayed three nights in Apr 08 in the North tower. This hotel is a great way to explore Brooklyn. Very convenient to subway stops and just around the corner from the Jay St (A line) stop. Room itself was great with lots of space and great amenities including a small refrigerator and coffee maker. I don't use internet while on vacation so can't comment on that. The room was newly renovated and very nice. The large HD TV was great! Bed was very comfortable and fresh, clean white linens made it even more inviting after a long day of sightseeing. Bathroom was spacious and plenty of counter space for toiletries. Hotel provided a hair dryer in the room. Room had a large closet, too. Pool and gym were welcome features. The pool was a bit chilly but not unbearable. Nice enough for a few laps to loosen up. Hot tub was kind of small but served its purpose. Sauna was good size. Lots of gym equipment and not many people using it over weekend. Only thing I would change is pool hours; they close at 7 p.m. on weekends. Did not eat a meal in the Archives restaurant but the bar area is a nice place for a quick snack - including Junior's cheescake if you are so inclined. Also be sure to check out the historic artifacts they have in the display cabinets - some FREE interesting Brooklyn history right there in the hotel and courtesy of the Brooklyn Historical Society! Slight downsides to the hotel: some of the rooms are quite a way from the elevator since there is only one bank of elevators. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and did a great job. One day they were literally on the floor cleaning for 12 hours; from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m. I did think that was a little bit late to be cleaning, including the accompanying noise. Otherwise, the hotel was quiet and peaceful at night. The front desk staff were proficient, although a bit rushed. Understandable due to the traffic at the desk at times. Concierge was helpful and friendly. Doormen tried to sell the services of a towncar versus a cab, but the cabs were available so used one of them to get to the Williamsburg area. About a $12 cost. It's a very easy walk (apx. 2 blocks) to the Brooklyn Bridge walkway entrance. Out the front door and turn right. There is a restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner right at the corner where you enter walkway, which is convenient if you want a meal on the way there or back. All in all, a great stay and I would definitely stay at the Marriott again! GO SEE BROOKLYN it's a wonderful alternative to Manhattan!"

"Review_14362","hotel_199","hotel_8718","Mar 17, 2008","The Marriott Is Good Alternative Booked a Last-Minute Deal through Travelocity for quick single person weekend trip before Spring/Summer prices go up and New York gets too crowded and hot. Options for relatively inexpensive hotels were limited, but chose the Marriott based on total price for air and hotel ($554 total including taxes/fees). Thought that was pretty good deal for 2 nights and flight from Greensboro, NC (we have lousy connections and EXPENSIVE flights from our airport). Just wanted an adventure out of town and to see some shows before work gets busy. Tried the cheap inbound trip on the M60 bus from La Guardia to Lexington Ave., then subway (4 or 5) directly to Burrough Hall stop (a five minute or less walk to hotel). This took about 1.5 hours from airport to hotel, but cost 2.00). Hotel in safe area, well lit, lots of traffic. Hotel is very pleasant and easy to find on Adams Street (main drag). Checked in at noon, no problem; got king-size bed, but no view on 4th floor of older building because none available at that hour; receptionist was very nice and I appreciated the early check-in; I suspect I could have checked in earlier or gotten a better view if had checked in later. The pool/exercise center is terrific; clean, new equipment, not crowded when I was there, and the hot tub was great after early morning travel. Towels provided at the pool. Nice clean locker room. Room was large by NY standards (15 X15 at least), floor to ceiling windows overlooking street (good curtains, shears, and light-blocking curtains), not noisy at all; large/clean bathroom with combo shower/tub; lots of towels; room seemed new and fresh; nothing fancy, but very attractive and comfortable!!! Could have just hung out in the room. Coffee maker but no robes or mini-bar; did have mini-fridge which was nice touch. Bed and linens/pillows all super comfortable. Flat screen TV nice. Hallway noise non-existent. Bar food at midnight on Friday night was a first-rate burger and fries for $14. Bar was pleasant, not crowded or loud. The bridge itself is about a 15 minute quick walk; takes about 30 minutes quick pace to cross to Manhattan at court house from the hotel entrance; pleasant safe walk. Manhattan Bridge walkway also close by if going directly to Chinatown, but not as pleasant a walk because of trains (my opinion); also, not many people, so a little spooky. Chinatown is a 45 minute quick walk from hotel across bridge; West Village about an hour or so. nice part of town to walk in. Subway stops are all convenient; travel time from Burrough Hall stop to 42nd Street on #4 train about 20-30 minutes or less; or take downtown train (#4,5,6) to Brooklyn Bridge stop and walk back over the Bridge; excellent sights. World Trade Center about a 30 minute walk from hotel. Let me check bags for Sunday afternoon stroll about town. Lincoln Towncar to La Guardia $30 flat rate; nice trip on Sunday afternoon, about 15 minutes from hotel, though it can be much longer depending on traffic. For the price, this was a good choice for me, nice place to hang out and return to late in the evening or early morning. Explored Brooklyn Heights which is just southwest of the hotel; ate at Pete's Downtown with view of East River and skyline; good reasonable Italian for about half of Manhattan prices (at foot of Fulton Landing right under the bridge and nextdoor to DUMBO; River Cafe is right across the street. Brooklyn Promenade is worth the walk. This area is pretty historic with some old houses and Washington headquarters in 1776; pretty charming. All in all, very much enjoyed this hotel and Brooklyn (and the price, which was something like $190/night). I would prefer this hotel to Times Square (for sure) or Midtown (maybe) if the price was right because it was quiet and convenient."

Staff was very friendly also. Overall, great property. But it's Brooklyn. If you want to do New York touristy stuff...don't stay here."
"Review_14364","hotel_199","hotel_9982","Mar 14, 2008","Service standards need urgent attention!! My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of February as part of our 50th wedding anniversary celebrations. How fortunate that we were due to cruise on Queen Mary 2 for the next 10 nights; and what a contrast in the standards of service!! Only one clerk on duty at reception in a 667 room hotel! A request for a possible upgrade was met with a brusque negative. The hotel had been informed in advance of the occasion but we were given a very basic room about as far from an elevator as you could get. No account was taken of my wife's mobility problemsand a promised room change never materialised. The room keys we were given didn't work so we stood in the corridor waiting for assistance. Reception would send someone up straightaway but 15 minutes later no-one had arrived. A bell boy eventually arrived with our luggage and used his master key to let us in; but we still did not have any keys for the room.The information folder said that breakfast was available in the restaurant until 11.30 am. Going down at 10.15 we were told that the buffet would close at 10.30 and we had better hurry. Sure enough the shutters on the buffet were brought down prematurely at 10.27 and the waiting staff couldn't get us out of the place quickly enough in order to set the tables for lunch. A very bad impression and very misleading information in the room.On the next two mornings we breakfasted at a nearby diner where the food and service were superior and at about 1/3rd of the price.The rooms are larger than average for New York and the location is good with easy access to the lovely Brooklyn waterfront and good subway connections to Manhattan. It is also a short taxi ride to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. But the management of the hotel needs to get its act together.We have stayed in at least a dozen other Marriotts in USA from San Diego to Las Vegas and this was our worst experience by far."

I hope to have many more stays here in the years to come.Positives:鈥?The hotel is well-located in Brooklyn, near the Brooklyn Bridge, the promenade, subway stations, and many excellent and not-too-expensive restaurants.鈥?Some of the rooms (not mine, alas, but a friend鈥檚 that I was traveling with) have excellent view of the Manhattan skyline, the East River, and the Brooklyn bridge. (He had a 20th-floor room in the south tower; I had a 10th-floor room with a limited view.)鈥?The room was kept very clean, and the maid service was friendly and prompt (sometimes even before I was ready, which is unusual for me!).鈥?The staff were friendly and helpful, and wished me luck at the competition I was here to attend. :-)鈥?I liked the airport checkin terminal at the front desk, where you can print out boarding passes for your flight. This worked great.鈥?I liked the bathroom amenities, too, a nice orange-ginger set of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion (I think it was Bath and Body Works).鈥?If you need your Starbucks fix, there are two within a block or so of the hotel.鈥?The hotel has a car service, which I used to get back to LaGuardia 鈥?it has a flat rate and is a little more expensive than a taxi would be, but I loved the ease and comfort of the quiet, clean car, and would happily use the service again. You can, of course, also get a regular taxi, of which there are plenty.鈥?Although Adams Street, on which the hotel faces, is a large street that鈥檚 very busy during the day, it quiets down considerably at night (almost spookily so), and I didn鈥檛 hear any street noise in my room.鈥?The water pressure and temperature in the shower were good, and the bed was comfortable.鈥?I was here for an event being held in the hotel, but I could see using this hotel as a base to explore Manhattan, too 鈥?you can walk across the bridge, or, there are subway stops for several different lines within a block of the hotel. I trundled my relatively large bag from my Midtown Manhattan hotel to this hotel using the subway, with no difficulty at all.Negatives/other factors鈥?I didn鈥檛 like the shower head 鈥?it was very adjustable, with all sorts of options for mist, pulsing jets, etc., but somehow I couldn鈥檛 get it to just spew out a bunch of water. :-)鈥?Next time I would ask for one of the rooms with a better view. (My friend checked in after me and joined the Marriott frequent stay program right before he booked his room, whereas I鈥檝e been a member much longer, yet he got the better room 鈥?grr!)鈥?The lobby could use a few more places to congregate. You go up an escalator to the 2nd floor, where registration is, and although there are a few chairs there, there weren鈥檛 quite enough.鈥?A lot of the hotel shut down at odd times, including the foyer outside the ballroom area. I can understand locking the ballroom itself, but the foyer held extra chairs, restrooms, etc., and I couldn鈥檛 see any reason why it couldn鈥檛 have been kept open around the clock.鈥?I could not get my alarm clock to change the hour. (The rest of it seemed to work fine.)鈥?I didn鈥檛 eat at the hotel restaurant so can鈥檛 comment on that.In summary, the event I attended is likely to be held at this hotel for years to come, and I look forward to returning to the hotel every year for it. It was an excellent choice by the event organizers that otherwise I would never have known about."

Even we were charged for an extension cord plus tax on the cord! If you want internet hook-up, they change a large amount for each day and each computer -- more than the room rate. We did get a discount for rooms but the hotel made up for this situation by taxing and charging us $80 dollars for coffee - 1 gal. They think that people will just accept the high prices because this is New York City. It is not! Brooklyn is locate across the river. Watch the contract! We could not bring in food! If you want to save some money, go somewhere else. This hotel is out to make money at the customer's expense. It is NOT worth it. We will not go again. Also the seminar rooms were not cleaned after use. Ugh. We learned the hard way. Watch out for the manager of the hotel. He will offer discounts for another stay. Another opportunity for them to get your money!"
"Review_14367","hotel_199","hotel_10605","Jan 28, 2008","All around great hotel for a great value Stayed for one night at this hotel and it was great! I have no complaints at all. There is underground parking at a very reasonable price (we paid only $18). Our room was spacious and had a view of the courthouse and the river. The bed was very comfortable and there was also a comfy chaise as extra seating near the window. The decor was modern and trendy. I really like the touch of the ipod docking station alarm clock too! The bathroom was roomy and nicely decorated. Good toiletries too (orange spice from bath and body works), gave it a spa feel. There was a coffeemaker and fridge in the room. The room and hallways were all very clean. Noise was not a problem even though it is a large hotel.The hotel is in a great, convenient location. It is close to a variety of subway stops. We had no problem grabbing a cab/car with the assistance of the hotel. We hardly waited at all on a Saturday night. Tons of shops and restaurants nearby...everything from drugstores to clothing stores. I checked out the pool/ftiness room. Very large fitness room with good selection of cardio and weights. Also a lap pool, which looked nice, but it was packed so i decided against trying to get in. Both are accessible via a bridge connecting the two towers of the building so you don't need to go through the lobby in your bathing suit or gym clothes, which is nice. Overall, really nice stay and I would definitely go back again! Nice alternative to being in manhattan with still very convenient."
"Review_14368","hotel_199","hotel_3882","Jan 24, 2008","Great stay between Christmas and New year Stayed with my wife and 12 year old son for five nights between Christmas and New Year's Eve 2007 and had a superb stay. Had a large, comfortable and well appointed room on the 14 th floor of the new wing with a nice view of Brooklyn Bridge. All staff were very pleasant, helpful and friendly - concierge and valet especially. Nice bar/restaurant area - had a great meal one night - try the fish and chips washed down with Brooklyn lager! Some people don't like the location as you have to travel to get to Manhattan but we thought it was excellent - close to the upmarket area of Brooklyn Heights with good restaurants (try Grand Canyon Diner for breakfast and Pete's Downtown for nice Italian), half hour walk over Brooklyn Bridge to South Street Seaport, few hundred yards to subway stations which get you to most places on Manhattan (used subway a couple of times - only 15 minutes and $2 to Maddison Square Garden or Central Park South - no problems) plus the hotel is the first stop on the open top bus tour loop of Brooklyn which finishes at South Street from where you can pick up the downtown Manhattan loop - book tickets with the concierge. Hotel was excellent value compared with similar standard Manhattan hotels. Will definitely stay here again."
"Review_14369","hotel_199","hotel_2061","Jan 17, 2008","great especially traveling with a w/c Needed to travel to Blkyn for a 50th wedding anniversary party for my mom's brother. Mom is very heavy and uses an extra wide w/c.We were offered the senior citizen rate of $169 per night for both rooms. The h/c room, reserved at the last minute only had a king...I could have gotten a roll away (which I actually saw and for a change it looked quite comfortable) but got an adjoining room for myself and Mom's aide. Each room had a small fridge but no microwave. The shower in Mom's room was great, a large fold down seat and sturdy bars...Rooms were spectacularly clean with luxury bedding and more pillows than I'd ever seen! The staff were not only professional but warm, helpful and friendly. All set up for business with plenty of plugs and internet access.I made it to Broadway in 20 minutes on an express train on Saturday morning! I's only two stops until you reach Manhattan! There were two different lines quite close to the hotel; the A C and the 1 2 3....about 35 minutes to the Museum of Natural History. The area around the hotel seemed quite safe, I went to a drug store at 2 am for some necessary items. My past experience in Manhattan was that there was a lot of hustle and bustle at the hotels and the rooms were tiny, lobbies almost non existent in some. I think it's a wonderful value to have so much space both in the room and nice places in the lobby to relax and be so close to everything. I went to college nearby at LIU about 20 years ago and the area has certainly changed for the better!When I stayed in NJ just walking distance to the bridge if I took a cab it was $18 just to get over the bridge! I took a cab from the Upper West Side back to the door of my hotel for $22...no fees for going over the bridge.The restaurant was pricey but nice fresh eggs and smoked salmon for breakfast ...Junior's Cheesecake was close by!The only problems were with the garage...the elevator near the h/c parking spaces sis not operate on the week ends but we didn't find that out till we were actually inside calling for assistance! The desk clerk was very sympathetic to our complaint, comped us all breakfast and promised to look into it. The next day we found after pulling up to a particular exit from the garage that the cashier did not have the equipment to process our parking ticket. Two other cars had to back out so that I could do a five point turn with the mini van and go to the Adams Street exit. The hotel manager promised to review the situation and I trust that he will. The garage is not owned/operated by the hotel but these kinks should be ironed out."

The staff were very professional and friendly especially the concierge 'Guiani; I think who gave us all the information but did not force us to buy tickets etc from him which was great.The room was very spacious and the bed was just fantastic -so comfy. We ate breakfast twice and it was good.$16.00 for continental buffet with a larger choice if you wanted hot items. They also servce Star Bucks Coffee in the bar in the mornings if you just want a to go coffee. We ate in the bar twice, they serve bar food until 12 midnight which was great after a days shopping if you did not want to go back out for food.Overall we really enjoyed it, the hotel is only 2 subway stops from Wall Street or a 30 minute walk over the Brooklyn Bridge!"

Subway access to Manhattan is a few blocks away and there are many nice neighborhoods within walking distance. Fulton St mall is just around the corner, but is best seen during the day. The hotel staff was both pleasant and helpful. The room was comfortable and well appointed. It still irks me to pay extra for internet access, but that's how it is in full service hotels."
"Review_14372","hotel_199","hotel_5649","Jan 12, 2008","Clean and friendly, but... I stayed at this hotel for two nights from Dec, 31st 2007 until Jan, 2nd 2008.The hall was really nice and there was a nice smell all the time- like some sort of candle or something.Check in was easy and quick. They gave me two queen size beds although a king size was guaranteed- but I didn't really care about that. (just an observation).One thing I found a bit strange is, that they wanted to look into my bag before they would let me check-in.. Probably that was because of New Year's Eve?!The room was clean and spacious, but: my room was on the ninth floor and facing a big street and hence pretty loud. I could also hear people talking in the room next to me. I went to the reception and they gave me a room on the 22nd floor which was quiet, but the fan in the bathroom was running and couldn't be switched off, so I decided to stay in my room on the 9th floor, although they told me that I could change rooms the next morning, because they were 'kind of' sold out. I decided not to change rooms, because actually I was too lazy and I was there for only two nights. After the second night I woke up at about 8.30 a.m. hearing doors slamming, people talking and AGAIN the noises from the street. Another thing I have to mention (someone mentioned it before as well): the pillows: they weren't very comportable... they were to high and at some point I just slept on the mattress without a pillow. The mattress was- unfortunately- not as comfortable as it should be... I am very thin, but when I got up in the morning you could see where exactly I was lying and I guess you can imagine that it wasn't very comfortable during the night either.I was surprised that they don't offer free internet. You obviously have to pay for the internet in the room, you also had to pay, I think, $3 or 5 to use the internet in the Business Lounge for 15 minutes. There are just 3 computers in there and it was occupied everytime I went by. I guess for $199 and more per night I can assume that there is free internet available. But the good points: the hotel was just one block away from some subway stations and with an express train it just takes about 5 minutes to Wall Street- Financial disctrict- and 15 minutes to midtown- Times Square.Everybody in the hotel was very nice and tried to help as much as possible. About 2 minutes awaw from the hotel you have a Burger King and a Wendy's and about 5 minutes there is a drug store.Unfortunately I had no chance to get that great look over Manhattan. They tell you on the homepage that you have a great view from the Concierge Lounge, but the Concierge Lounge is only for (as far as I remember) for platinum marriott members. Instead I walked to the Brooklyn Bridge and to Manhattan- which just takes about 25 Minutes- if you aren't taking pictures like crazy like I was ; )To sum it up: the location was good, the room clean, spacious and the staff was friendly and helpful. If you are more or less just sleeping there and sleeping not longer than 8.am or 8.30 am and have a deep slepp I can definately recommend it ; )"

From refurbished, spacious, comfortable rooms to a relaxing lounge where fine wine and foods are served, the Giraffe will make your visit beyond memorable.

"Review_14380","hotel_200","hotel_6008","Dec 27, 2008","Mostly lovely! We have just got back from a 3 night Xmas break at The Hotel Giraffe. I spent far too much time looking into the 'perfect' place to stay with our 18 month old little girl. Wanted it to be that extra bit special. It was important that we got a one bedroom suite (Separate lounge and bedroom) and they are not so easy to come by in New York, without paying a small fortune, especially if you want the quality too. Not that the Giraffe is at all cheap but you expect to pay a bit for a quality Hotel in NY. The lady who answered my initial reservation enquiries was very efficient and helpful, via email. Always responding quickly to my requests. So a good first impression was made. We were recc a good place to eat on Christmas day. Turned out to be great so thanks for that.When we arrived early our room was ready which was great. Allowing us to check in at 1pm was most appreciated. The room although very dark was comfortable and the extras such as robes,bottled water, toiletries and even an umbrella in the closet! Added a nice touch. Shame we forgot the ipod as there was a dock in the bedroom. Rooms very clean. Cold on a evening and found it difficult to get the right temp and noisy a/c. Not noisy from outside though, guess it depends where your room is located in the Hotel. Good spacious bathrooms, although not so keen on see through doors! Possibly done to help with light. Not so good if you are on the shy side....Breakfast was fresh and more than enough. Disappointed there were no highchairs in the Hotel. Spent a lot of time chasing our little sweetheart around the lobby with a croissant (Hopefully not irritating other Guests!)The complimentary wine on an evening was very welcomed.The lovely lady playing the piano was very sweet to our little girl, thank you, it really made us feel more relaxed.One of our gripes is that it didnt feel very Christmas like in the Hotel. We had really wanted it to be special with been away from home, and expected it to have more of an atmosphere. Felt it lacked something. Guess we would still have this opinion if it wasnt Christmas, too.A Christmas tree in the lobby would have been nice. Don't expect the staff to break out into 'Jingle bells' when we enter the lobby, but a little cheer would not have gone a miss.Don't get us wrong most of the staff were friendly (Jose and the other guys on the door were very courteous, nothing too much trouble) Unfortunately a couple of others on reception lacked the same enthusiasm, which let it down really. A few more smiles would have been nice.When we come back to NY we will most likely try somewhere else, but we'd definately say to give Hotel Giraffe a try. Some nice touches/extras, make it overall a good place to stay."

Can't beat the convenient location, as it is very near the subway with lots of taxis and busses. A light breakfast is included in your stay in the lobby, or for an extra $5 you can have it delivered to your room. The staff is very friendly.

The service was excellent: friendly and accommodating. Free access to the nearby (three blocks) New York Sports Club was most appreciated.

"Review_14383","hotel_200","hotel_8066","Dec 4, 2008","Do toilet rolls really need a ribbon? The Hotel Giraffe stands out from the sort of anonymous chain hotels so usually found in the middle of major cities. The service is efficient and courteous without being sycophantic. The rooms, although they're the typical box-shape, are comfortable and roomy enough. The facilities are to the standard you'd expect for a upper-range hotel. The location is superb, a few minutes' walk from the Empire State Building, but the stretch of Park Avenue is safe and comparitively quiet (but that's still noisy to anyone not used to the 24 hour roar of a city). We could have lived without some of the so-called luxury touches like the ribbon around the toilet roll, and the only way to access the Cable TV decoder was to keep the cupboard door open, which was so wrong. But overall we enjoyed our stay here. It wasn't the most exciting, glamorous or stylish hotel we've ever stayed in, but it was an ideal place to stay for a holiday in central Manhattan."

The hotel is in a fantastic location and within easy walking distance to key sights such as the Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue and Grand Central Station. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and are happy to research information on attractions, bars and restaurants.The roof terrace would be great in summer but the views aren't spectacular.The cheese and wine offered is average. There is only 1 white and 1 red to pick from so you can't be fussy. The cheese is bland and low quality, not up to scratch if you like your European cheeses.I would definitely stay here again, but would also research other hotels."

The French doors leading to the little balcony are a wonderful touch, and also they make the room nice and bright. (I also loved the switch-operated screens for the blinds at night). It is quiet at night (other than the occasional sirens from police etc which I imagine are unescapable anywhere in the city), and much more tranquil an area than Times Square, for example (read: you can go out but when you go home to bed, you actually get to sleep).The room was an oasis after walking all over the city. The location is amazing. Go uptown and shop or see museums. Walk right out the door and Madison Square Park is a block away and shops not much further. Go downtown and wander. The service was very good, although a few more smiles would be nice.The breakfast was simple but really just what you need to get your day started.We would definitely go again.Of note, I booked through the hotel website and got a deal.

The beds were really comfortable.The hotel is spotlessly clean in all areas. The hotel is lovely as it is quite small and personal but the service is never intrusive. The breakfast served in the lobby is lovely and the perfect start to a day sightseeing in NYC.I think my favourite thing about the hotel is how relaxed and calm it is - sometimes New York gets quite hectic and it really did feel nice to come back to the tranquil peace of the hotel giraffe to chill out.The location is also perfect as it is literally 1 minute walk from the 6 subway route and so really easy to get everywhere in the city. There are also some lovely restaurant on the block which are really handy if you dont feel like getting a cab anywhere.Try Dos Caminos for a great, and busy mexican right next door Blue Smoke for a truely american rib experience ( just round corner on 27th)Brilliant hotel and would never consider staying anywhere else in NYC."

"Review_14393","hotel_200","hotel_2595","Nov 4, 2008","Wonderful! We stayed for one week at the Giraffe and I cannot praise it enough. We had a deluxe room with 2 double beds for our family of 4 (including 2 teenage daughters). Room was very attractive and of a decent size. Particularly liked the electronic blinds - it was great first thing in the morning to lazily press a button by the bed and with a clunk clunk, the blinds lifted to reveal New York. It felt like being in a James Bond film. The room also had a balcony which must be quite rare in the city. Every evening we came back after a busy day to find music playing softly and the beds turned down with chocolates left on the pillows.Initially when we arrived I wasn't that keen on the look of the main lounge area, I think it needed some softer lighting with table lamps. Although in the morning it was bustling and jolly with guests at breakfast. We thought the breakfast was exceptionally good. Wonderfully fresh food, including bagels, croissants, rolls, fresh fruit salad, cereals and yogurts - daily papers to read too. The lounge had a lovely informal feel to it in the mornings.Most evenings we made use of the complimentary wine and cheese. We tried to make an effort for this as New York can be so exhausting that it was great to get back and relax with a glass or 2 of prosecco before heading out to dinner. A pianist playing on a grand piano too.Location wise, we thought it was perfect as it is just a couple of blocks away in either direction to the subways on 23rd or 28th street, and only 2 stops to Grand Central Station, with just one change from there to Times Square.Even though the reception desk is very small, we found the staff to be very courteous and helpful. They were only too happy to telephone various tours we wanted to be booked on.One of the highlights of our trip was to see the New York Knicks playing at Madison Square Garden. A real showbiz/sporty extravaganza! Only about 20 minutes to walk back to hotel afterwards.Grand Central Station also just has to be seen - it is spectacular. The food market inside is a rival for the food hall at Harrods.Empire State Building - go up in late evening. We went at 11pm (closes at 2am) and there were no queues. Wonderful night time vista.Take a 2 hour bike tour of Central Park to see all the best bits.Get half price tickets for most of the shows at TKTS in Times Square. Opens at 2 pm.Ellen Stardust Diner in Times Square for singing waiting staff. Loved it. Food is extremely ordinary, but you don't go for the food!Did about 4 main sights every day, so the relaxing drink back at the hotel was very welcome.Back to the Giraffe. Do not think we could have found a better hotel. Loved it (and I am quite hard to please!)"

There are some genuinely smart boutique hotles in NYC - this is not one of them."

The breakfast is just right, fresh fruit and bagels, and wine and cheese every evening is a nice after-shopping treat. I liked the decor of our room, which was pretty spacious for NYC. I give it a thumbs up."

It's a little pricey, but they do so much extra for the guests that you feel like they really appreciate your business. Check in was simple. When we arrived there was a complimentary wine and cheese assortment with live music. In the very busy NYC, this was such a relaxing break. The room was very beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. The breakfast, included in the rate, is another amenity that makes hectic NYC so much easier to manage. The location at 26th and Park can't be beat. I highly recommend this hotel and will gladly return again in the future."

We chose the hotel to celebrate my birthday and also to spend our first trip to New York. We were looking for something central, but also out of the main tourist areas, and with a certain uniqueness. The hotel was perfect on all counts. We found the staff to be excellent, nothing was too much trouble, and they helped make my birthday very special. The room was gorgeous and comfortable, we had a view all the way down Park Avenue South from our balcony, the cheese and wine was great and we found the location to be perfect - there are several great restaurants nearby - A Voce and Dos Caminos - and a subway stop a couple of minutes walk away.

The room itself was spacious and had a cute balcony to watch the world go by. The bed was comfy with a selection of pillows, the bathroom was clean and well stocked. It was the little touches that made it special though - robes and slippers, luxurious toiletries, complimentary bottles of water, and an iHome dock so we could play our own music. We were on the 11th floor which is definitely recommended as the street noise can get loud.The staff were always very efficient and polite, and so helpful with information and taxi-catching. The continental breakfast was fresh and a real treat, and the wine and cheese evenings were a lovely way of unwinding after a hard day's shopping. The Barna roof terrace was also a fine place to have a cocktail before heading out for the evening (and the tapas was delicious here too). Room service is from the Barna restaurant downstairs and was quick and plentiful.The hotel is located in a great neighbourhood - great restaurants and bars to suit all tastes and styles, close to the subway and it was very easy to grab a cab on Park Ave. Madison Square Park is only a short block away and we had a lovely few hours with a picnic there - just pick up some take out on 23rd street and enjoy the greenery and calm for a while.In all, a fab hotel and a great location - highly recommended!"

Usually my business trips leave me in boring and uninspiring hotels, though this time around I splurged and went for something different. Different is what I got! The Giraffe was incredible! After a long day of dealing with unrelenting clients, Wine and Cheese available in the lounge was outstanding. The staff was helpful in helping my navigate my way around the city, even providing me a map and highlighting some must see spots for me. The room was beautifully appointed and very cushy, which I like. The only downside of my stay was that the room next to mine had a small child that was screaming two of my four nights. Babies cry, but by all means, stick a nipple in the poor kids mouth or something!All and all the stay was great. Im from LA, so dealing with Taxis was a bit off for me, but I got into the swing of things quickly.I will definatly be returning."

There is no business center, but there is a single computer in the lobby available first come first served.Rates were competitive. We would stay at the Giraffe again and recommend it to friends."

The location was just what we needed, away from the Time Square crowd, yet close enough to things when walking, taking the subway, etc. The room was large by NY standards (I had been in town on business), the decor was fun, the staff attentive. The lobby was great with breakfast in the morning, all-hours espresso machine, wine/cheese/piano in the late afternoon. We had an issue with a too-soft bed that was resolved quickly. The only negatives were the spotty internet availability and that the staff could have been a bit more knowledgable about simple issues like the subway, tourist attractions, etc. Since it was too small to have a concierge, the people at the desk should have known a bit more. We would definitely stay there the next time."

I was thrown by the name initially but after I checked out their site, I knew that this was the place I wanted to stay and, I wasn't disappointed. I had the deluxe queen room which was nice and spacious. A nice and clean bathroom (which I'm always a bit weary of) and attentive staff. The breakfast selection was enough to get you started on your day and the wine and cheese evenings were a perfect way to relax after a day on the streets before heading out to dinner.

Our double bedded room was BIG by New York standards, the furnishings were modern by warm, beds comfy and the bathroom very nice-sized with nice toiletries. Loved the bath robes.

"Review_14411","hotel_200","hotel_5545","Aug 19, 2008","A wonderful stay at the Giraffe Last weekend my family went for a quick trip to New York City. We were looking for somewhere nice but not too expensive to stay and the Giraffe exceeded all of our expectations. The service from everyone, particularly Jose, was outstanding; always present and eager to help but never intrusive. The rooms were gorgeous with nice amenities and plenty of room for 3 of us with two double beds. I really appreciated the amount of natural light during the day and then the shade that lowered at night to block out all of the lights of the city. It is not a huge room, but it served our purposes very well. The decor was simple and elegant. The beds are a little hard and the pillows were a little soft, but they do provide harder pillows in the closet. Once I used those the bed became very comfortable. The bathroom was also quite spacious for such a small room and I particularly appreciated the cloth they provided to wipe the steam off the mirrors after exiting the shower. I personally enjoyed the lobby area just to sit and read a book or enjoy a cup of coffee. It has plenty of natural light and high ceilings with classic decor and beautiful flower arrangements. It was a great setting for breakfast, afternoon tea and wine and cheese in the evening. The breakfast was your standard breakfast, but the coffee was good and everything was always fresh. Wine and cheese in the evening was a great way to unwind after the day and before going out to dinner. If you are looking for a boutique hotel in New York with a wonderful location and exceptional service, the Giraffe is the place for you!"

We were celebrating a birthday and I had indicated this when I booked the room (on the hotel's site). A bottle of champagne was waiting on ice when we entered our room, compliments of the hotel. And chocolates! The wine in the evenings, breakfast in the morning, and warmth and helpfulness of the staff make up for any price difference above other Manhattan hotels- you just won't find this level of quality any cheaper. We loved the robes and slippers they have hanging in the closet. The staff was super helpful with directions on the subway system, restaurant picks (try Ray's pizza or Porchao just across the intersection), and recommendations for a night out. We will stay here again, without a doubt."

"Review_14414","hotel_200","hotel_9563","Aug 11, 2008","Nice My husband and I stayed at Hotel Giraffe this past weekend, it was a combination Birthday/Anniversary celebration. I noted that when I made the reservation, but unlike many of the other guests, we were not greeted with wine or chocolate in our room. I know that is a courtesy, but if you do it for one guest, you should really do it for all guests. The hotel is charming and as another reviewer added not a cookie cutter, chain hotel. We especially liked the complimentary wine and cheese evening reception. On Saturday we went to a 2:00 show and then checked into the hotel, it was so nice to have a few glasses of wine and a snack before heading off to a late dinner. The only thing disappointing was there wasn't a piano player when we were there. Unless he/she came after we had left.Anyway, the rooms are spacious and clean. I was pleasantly surprised that our room had a balcony overlooking the city. It was very romantic and beautiful. Of course the traffic was loud at night, but I have learned from experience to always travel with a fan for some white noise. So, it wasn't too bothersome. The beds weren't very comfortable, but I don't think that's uncommon in hotels, at least from my perspective. I think the decor could be kicked up a notch, but it was above average nonetheless. The continental breakfast was nice, but nothing fancy. The coffee was weak and the cappuccino/espresso machine was like something out of a convenience store and it either wasn't working well or just wasn't tasty. It was also very crowded and difficult to find a seat to eat in the morning, this was a little annoying, but we got over it.The staff was friendly and helpful. They held our bags and our car until after checkout so we could stay in the city longer, so that was nice.The one thing that was really great about the hotel was the rooftop bar. My husband and I headed up there after dinner to have a drink and it was a quaint/romantic place to relax before going back to our room.Overall I would recommend this hotel to a friend and would stay again in the future."

"Review_14417","hotel_200","hotel_10496","Jul 26, 2008","A mixed bag and a nice try Hotel Giraffe really was like two different places. At night, the elevators were full of drunk, yelling hipsters and 20-something tourists (maybe they were guests) going to and from the rooftop bar. In the morning, at breakfast, it was mostly older folks--and I mean *older* older; I wondered if these people heard all the noise the night previous or whether it worked out fine because they couldn't hear that well. The place overall seemed to have a veneer of modernity and sophistication about it, but just under the surface was a lack of quality that broke the illusion. The rooms were nicely decorated, and efforts were made to lend upper-end feel, but look closely at the details--a plain institutional box of tissue, an unwrapped roll of toilet paper, creaky old air con units--and it tells the story. This kind of playing at being a hip hotel theme persisted elsewhere too: desk staff whose suits didn't fit quite right making strained efforts at cordiality, but clearly not paying attention to guests or very practiced in their jobs; breakfast staff standing by to pour each guest a cup of coffee at the bar, but then disappearing for minutes at a time requiring me to serve myself (I didn't mind, it was just awkward since they had this stand-by-to-serve thing going on before). Overall, I guess the impression is nice try. At this kind of rate, though, I'd prefer to stay someplace that knows its business and has hospitality down pat-- thoroughly nice instead of just trying."

"Review_14427","hotel_200","hotel_4520","Jun 29, 2008","Very NIce Boutique Hotel in NYC's Midtown Area This hotel is an excellent alternative to staying at a major chain. Having been recently remodeled, the rooms are nicely appointed and well kept. Do not think however, that the rates are going to be much less than other major chains or other nicer boutique hotels. To their credit however, the rates in all of NYC have gone up substantially in the last couple of years. But, you could at times just as easily get a room at any of the 5-star hotels for almost the same if not less, than a room here at the Giraffe.The location on Park Avenue South is very central to most of the attractions of the mid-town area. The suites are nicer than the regular units, and quite spacious.Because I travel to NYC often for business, I have stayed here several times. The consistency is great, and several of the business amenities are key. They have free wireless in the rooms and lobby area (as well as hard-wire if you need it). There is also a printer in the lobby, with a stand-alone laptop, in case you need to print a boarding pass, or to just browse the web. There is a free continental breakfast in the morning. Nothing fancy, just some fruits, juices, bagels, etc.I would say that the biggest thing lacking at this hotel is a scene and good restaurant. Because this is a small boutique hotel, there is really no gathering of people there (but there are plenty of places close by). The other down side is that the restaurant is not open too late, and the food is mediocre at best (but again, there are plenty of other places close by)."

It was our first visit to New York and we chose the hotel after reading the reviews in Trip Advisor.Location:The hotel is centrally located in Midtown near a subway station, close to the Flatiron building and not too far from the Empire State Building. It is not in the main hotel district but we didn't find that a problem.We bought Metrocards on our first day and found it easy to get about by subway or bus. There is no direct subway line from the hotel to Times Square or Herald Sq (for Macys') but the connections were not difficult and there are always lots of taxis if necessary. There were plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby both on Park and Lexington Avenues.Accomodation:We booked a Superior King room this did not have a balcony but was comfortable and of good size for a City Centre hotel. The decor was stylish and the room was well equiped with a useful free WiFi. The only thing that could have been added would have been a kettle to make tea or coffee but this was available in the hotel lounge at all times if needed.We were on the 9th floor facing 26th street and found the room quiet. It was well insulated and with good air conditioning, Staff:The staff were pleasant and helpful without being intrusive. Reception was always well staffed.Generally:One feature of the hotel is the inclusive continental style buffet breakfast. It is not a hot breakfast but there is plenty of choice with cereals, fruit and fruit juices, hard boiled eggs, rolls, tea, coffee etc.I had mentioned when booking that my wife had a birthday during our stay. We were pleasantly surprised with the wine and belgian chocolates left in our room on our return that day.Another feature is the piano music and cheese and wine in the lounge each evening. This made for a pleasant break after sightseeing and shopping.Overall we were pleased with the Hotel Giraffe and would definitely stay again."
"Review_14430","hotel_200","hotel_3040","May 30, 2008","Nice Hotel but beware if you are a light sleeper... I really wanted to love this hotel. It is across the street from the office that I came here to visit on my business trip and in a great part of town. The reviews from past travelers sounded wonderful. And the hotel itself is very nice...extremely clean, very decent sized rooms that are tastefully decorated. Good sized bathrooms with marble counters. Plus the complimentary internet and breakfast is a great perk. Unfortunately, my problem with the hotel has very little to do with the hotel itself but with the level of noise from the busy streets it is located on. The first night I stayed here I got in very late after a grueling day of dealing with flight delays, etc. All I wanted to do was to rest in my room. Within a very short time of getting to my room, I heard a very loud slamming/cranking sound from the street. I called the front desk and asked what the sound was and was told it was the trash pickup and it would stop in a few minutes. About 30 minutes later (after midnite) I called down again because the noise was still going. I asked to be moved to a higher floor (I was on the 7th), but the hotel was sold out that night. The noise finally did stop, but the street noise from below was still pretty loud. The next day, the hotel staff agreed to move me to a room on the 5th floor facing Park Ave instead of 26th, since the trash pickup is on 26th. They were very nice about this and accomodating, which I really appreciated. Unfortuately, the move did not help much with the street noise. I am not sure if being on a higher floor would have helped (the hotel only goes up to the 12th floor). By the third night I finally found a way to drown out the street noise - I turned on the A/C in the room which makes a pretty loud humming noise and turned my iPod on to some soothing music (all rooms have iHome docks for your iPod). This definitely helped and I finally got a good nights sleep. So, bottom line - great hotel if you don't mind either hearing street noise or are OK with a cold room and humming sound from your A/C!!"

This hotel isn't imposing like some of the big ones in the city, but it has all you need for an enjoyable adult stay. Check in is easy, and the staff will take care of your needs.The hotel includes the basics - a nice, small lobby with nice views out the window as you eat your complimentary breakfast, and a cool rooftop garden to enjoy a drink or cigar.Of course, the location is nice - a great mix of residential, office and retail, and you can get anywhere in the city quickly via subway or cab. For a couple enjoying the city, it's perfect."

The rooms are a good size and well equipped, the breakfast was perfect, and the wine and cheese a great way to start the evening. Roof Bar was also a cozy place to grab after dinner drinks. There is good food near by with Blue Smoke right around the corner for BBQ or Haru for sushi, the park bar a short walk away for reasonably priced drinks."
"Review_14433","hotel_200","hotel_4825","May 20, 2008","Dependable Giraffe Again! This was our 3rd visit to the Giraffe. You can count on good service, clean moderately sized rooms with some upgrades, a daily continental breakfast and a daily wine and cheese reception in the large main lobby area (except Sunday). You are a two minute walk to a subway station on the green line so you can be in upper midtown/Central Park or south to the tip of Manhattan with a 10-15 minute subway ride max. It is a nice area for walking - Gramercy Park, Madison Square Park are very close (3-5 minutes) and Union Square is a 10-15 minute walk and lots of modestly priced restaurants within walking distance. There is a nightclub next door Barna (which also has a restaurant) - more for the younger crowd 20's and 30's which can be noisy in the evenings from the music, best to request a room higher up in the building if possible to escape the nightclub noise and to a lesser extent street level noise from traffic if either would be of concern. You won't be disappointed if you book this hotel - bear in mind it is a smaller boutique hotel so won't have the trappings of a big hotel like a Hilton etc. if that is what you are looking for.James Ottawa, Canada"

The rooms are very comfortable and nicely appointed with great amenities - flat screens, ipod docking stations, cable, etc. The staff is always courteous and very helpful. We absolutely love the breakfast that is included with the room - fabulous bagels, pastries, cereal, fresh fruit, juices, capuccinos, yogurt and much more. They also have a lovely cocktail hour with wine, cheese and crackers. The lobby is lovely, spacious and very comfortable. The hotel is also in a great location with easy access to either uptown or downtown. We will definitely be back and can't wait."

In fact, I had booked family as well, and everyone loved their experience. I am well traveled, and find the Giraffe very accommodating in every way. Yes, our room wasn't ready prior to 3, but keep in mind on the other end, checkout is at 1 pm. One great advantage is the comfortable lobby where you can have complimentary breakfast in the morning, cappuccino  cookies throughout the day, and at 5 pm, cheese, crackers and wine. The lobby in very condusive to talking and meeting friends in the city. The rooms are very comfortable and have many ammenities. The only drawback, is there is noise from the street, which you find in most NYC hotels. The doorman and lobby staff were wonderful, and when it was pouring rain, they were sure to flag a cab for us. Try the Giraffe, you won't be disappointed."

"Review_14438","hotel_200","hotel_4720","May 2, 2008","Giraffe is a Gem ! This hotel deserves all the rave reviews it's received to date! We booked on the strength of the Trip Advisor reviews and they were spot on. Almost afraid to rave about it myself as I want to go back and not have it booked up. An amazing gem in a fairly central location - quiet but only a few blocks from Empire State Building/Madison Square Garden / Macy's. 5 min walk to lovely Madison Park.Our room had a balcony it was spacious, spotless and cleaned twice a day! Cosy king size bed, fabulous bath and power shower. Towels stocked and chocolates on pillows - brilliant. The staff were courteous and attentive. The complimentary breakfast was ideal for morning fuel - lovely bagels / juices / croissants / tea / coffee / fruit along with morning papers. Evening wine and cheese and coffee/tea all throughout the day.There's an amazing Irish pub / steakhouse McCormacks just around the corner - beautiful steak, good beer and local new york atmosphereExcellent hotel - an absolute gem. Will definately be back!"
"Review_14439","hotel_200","hotel_4803","May 1, 2008","Average Boutique Hotel My husband and I looked forward to a weekend at Hotel Giraffe. From all prior reviews, I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. Upon arrival, I was a bit disappointed that we were not about to check into our room at 2PM. We were instructed that check in was at 3. We cannot say that the friendliness of the check in staff was extraordinary.We also looked forward to the wine hour, but this, again, was disappointing....generic American cheeses and ok wine. As for breakfast, the website lists a European-style breakfast, but I did not find what was European about fruit salad, bagels, and cerael. I would suggest that they get more whole grain items as well since I was a bit disapponted about no whole grain items.Overall, it was a OK visit. The hotel was clean and the hotel staff did the necessary actions, but I cannot say I was overly impressed by the hotel to the point where this would be the only hotel I would every stay at."
"Review_14440","hotel_200","hotel_1805","Apr 30, 2008","Memorable Stay I have stayed in many hotels in NYC and this one is by far my favorite. The room sizes are surprisingly large, with double sinks in the bathroom. The amenities in the lobby--breakfast, 24/7 coffee, wine/cheese in the evening with live piano music are nice. There are lots of good restaurants close by and the neighborhood is terrific. If you want to do the NYC tourist thing, stay farther uptown, but if you've done that and want to experience more of what the city has to offer, stay at the Giraffe. We actually moved up to the Waldorf Astoria for a few nights, and, honestly, I wish we would have stayed the entire time at the Giraffe--it really is that good!!"
"Review_14441","hotel_200","hotel_3087","Apr 28, 2008","Doesn't live up to the hype We knew when we arrived at the hotel that our room would most likely not be ready, rather than politely explaining that the room was not ready, they curtly informed us that check in time is 3 pm. That pretty much sums up the rest of the staffs attitude. Our room was on the 3rd floor facing Park Avenue, at night the sounds from the bar/restaurant in the hotel and bar next door were very loud. There was a wait to get in somewhere and the doorstaff did nothing to quiet the loud patrons coming and going. We could hear conversations clearly. When we told the hotel staff they curtly informed us that next time book a room on another side of the hotel.The room size was nice for NY as was the bathroom. Breakfast was a yawn as was the happy hour which offers only wine to guests. We've stayed at boutique hotels around the world and part of the charm is the people that work there - they tend to be more accomodating than the big named hotels. Not so much at the Giraffe. My husband has stayed at other nearby boutique hotels and has been much happier with the service."

Hotel Giraffe proved to be an oasis in the NYC desert of overpriced, over-rated, cookie-cutter hotels and cut-rate fleabags. We spent three nights and couldn't find a thing to complain about. Doormen, desk staff, housekeeping staff were on the ball, courteous, attentive and actually seemed to enjoy what they were doing. King-bed room was spacious, well-appointed, clean and comfortable. Location is a short 10- to 15-minute walk to Union Square, a shorter walk to Madison Square Park (and the Shake Shack's delicious burgers, fries and milkshakes) and convenient to uptown and downtown subways. Inexpensive? No. Worth the price? Definitely."

"Review_14445","hotel_200","hotel_5940","Mar 31, 2008","Doesn't deserve such a high review I purposely chose this hotel because it received such a high rating among NYC hotels on this website but was sorely disappointed. I expected more, especially for the price ($300+ for a single room). The hotel is certainly nice, clean, but fairly small. The room was also very small. I was offered a larger room for $70 or so more but declined. This hotel was average overall among the hotels I have stayed in the past and my suspicion is that some of the very high reviews came from the property management and their contacts. I could be wrong, but some of the reviews seemed very overrated. This hotel doesn't deserve to be in the very top among NYC hotels.The stay does include a continental breakfast of pastries, fruit, and cereal but I still don't feel the stay was worth the price. Also, the front desk was not very welcoming and one woman at the front desk seemed a bit condescending. I usually don't pay much attention to these kind of things but I felt unusually bad after checking in. The hotel is conveniently located near a subway stop and Madison Square Park, but no other major attractions within walking distance. I preferred staying in Times Square."
"Review_14446","hotel_200","hotel_9875","Mar 30, 2008","Nice Hotel, Good Location Stayed at the Hotel Giraffe for three nights during Spring Break with our two teenaged boys in a Junior Suite. Nice room, quiet but very small. We soon adapted to the size of the room but ended up with our youngest son (14) on the floor on the sofa cushions. Hotel staff assured us when we reserved the room that the fold out sofa bed would easily accomodate two teenaged boys. Doorman and maids couldn't have been nicer. Young front desk staff was a little stiff and unfriendly. Breakfast (included in room price) was disappointing; bagels, muffins, boiled eggs, cold cereals, juice, and yogurt. The next day, same stale bagels and muffins! We arrived for a late breakfast at 10:50 and hotel staff whisked it away at 10:58 instead of 11:00. Just rude! Evening wine and cheese was nice. Hotel is quiet and clean but could use some maintenance. Overall enjoyed our stay with a few small bumps in the road."
"Review_14447","hotel_200","hotel_1784","Mar 30, 2008","Great stay at Hotel Giraffe We stay in NYC at least twice a year but this was our first stay at Hotel Giraffe. As other reviews have said it has very large rooms by NYC standards. We were in NYC to get married, and the hotel had arranged for a bottle of prosecco in our room, which was a nice touch. The breakfast and evening wine and cheese in the bar is a great touch for a hotel that is in a really good location for adventures either up or downtown. Our only comment is slightly lackluster staff at the front desk, but this seemed to be due to age/inexperience rather than rudeness. However, this could be more of a concern for first time visitors who needed more information about things to do and how to get there. Overall, a great stay and we will most definitely return."

We stayed three adults in a room and had lots of room. Bathrooms were a great size and everything was very clean.

"Review_14455","hotel_200","hotel_9732","Feb 3, 2008","The Giraffe Was a Pleasant Treat for Us We spent one night at the Hotel Giraffe on Feb. 1. It was our first overnight visit to New York in 10 years, so after hearing the heart-stopping prices at previous places where we have stayed, I found this hotel at Kayak.com. The price ($331, including all taxes, for a room with a queen bed) seemed competitive, and the reviews were encouraging. We were not disappointed. While the lobby is not especially grand and the hallways/elevator seemed a little well-worn, the room itself was quite stylish and comfortable. We had plenty of space, and the bathroom was also nice. We were on the 9th floor and heard no street noise at night except the inevitable garbage truck. I liked the electronic window shade! The staff was always pleasant, and the breakfast (included), while not extravagant, was all we needed (juice, good coffee, fruit, cereal, yogurt, rolls). Nice piano music in the lobby in the evening. A friend who lives nearby came up to see the room and said it was much nicer than others he has seen for more money. He was happy to find a place he could recommend to out-of-towners seeking a less costly alternative. We didn't try the restaurant, so can't vouch about that. But all in all, we were happy with our stay and would return--in 10 years, probably!"
"Review_14456","hotel_200","hotel_10251","Jan 16, 2008","really liked the Giraffe WE stayed here over Christmas. We had a suite for our family of 4 , with 2 teenage daughters- plenty of room , nicely furnished, quiet , 2 tvs so no arguments, nice bathroom. The only difficulty was that the sofabeds are not very comfortable , so our girls felt they had to put up with this all week. We requested another matress to put on top but this did not arrive. Apart from that, we all loved this hotel - very relaxed, the buffet breakfast was just right for our needs , enough variety and very flexible, with eggs, cereals , lovely breads etc. Tea and coffee, biscuits and wine/cheese in the evening available free, made for a casual welcoming atmosphere, with no sense that 'it cost money to breathe' as you get in many large formal hotels. The computer in the lobby is very useful. This hotel was not cheap but is good value, especially considering breakfast is included. The staff were friendly and helpful. There are many good restaurants nearby and from this location it is easy to get anywhere in Manhatten. I would recommend the mexican restaurant next door - the margueritasare very good."
"Review_14457","hotel_200","hotel_5291","Jan 7, 2008","A great little hotel We stayed here for a week over Christmas, and chose the Giraffe based on the Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed. The staff were all friendly and helpful, the rooms clean, large enough and the bathroom well thought out. Plenty of storage space and a flat screen TV with DVD and CD. There is apparently a library of DVDs and CDs if you want them.We were on the 7th floor overlooking 26th Street and didn't hear a thing at night (maybe because we were so exhausted after such busy days).The simple complimentary breakfast (fruit, yoghurt, bagels, croissants, pastries, juice) is served in the lobby, where there is a laptop and printer - a blessing for email and internet access. A coffee machine serves excellent cappuccino.The wine (red, white, sparkling) and assorted cheeses that are freely available in the early evening are a nice touch, and there is a turn-down service with free water and chocs.It's a good location - close to a subway and within walking distance of much of what you want to see. We enjoyed the Union Square area to the south - great bars and restaurants and an interesting farmers' market there on Friday mornings. Check out the designer bargains in Filene's basement (on the third floor!) on the square.If I have to find a fault (and it's hard) the shower was struggling a bit at times in terms of temperature and pressure, but not to an unacceptable degree.In my experience (unless you have an unlimited budget) it can be hard to find a hotel in NYC that isn't well-used, and I wouldn't look beyond the Giraffe in future."

My wife and I stayed one night at the Hotel Giraffe on a last minute little romantic getaway and we were very pleased and impressed.We had made reservations, but arrived 6 hours before check-in at 9AM and the staff was very accomodating in arranging a room for us right away. Upon departure, we need a couple of extra hours given our late flight and again they were very accomodating.The rooms themselves are very comfortable, beautifully decorated with a clear impression that all guest amenities and room details were throughly planned out - from the quality of hotel towels to the various lighting options with the well placed switches for total convenience to the real plant in our room giving it a nice little touch of home. Our room also had a really lovely balcony and although we did not use it, it gave the room a very delightful touch.In the mornings the hotel offers a complinentary breakfast of pastries, fruit, hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea, and juice - definetly nothing elaborated, but perfect for starting your day in New York, all enjoyed in the very comfortable hotel lobby. In the evenings there is a complimentary wine and cheese that served as the perfect break for us after a day on the town before we went up to our rooms to rest for our night on the town.As for location, it was perfect for us as we explored both uptown and downtown and being right in the middle had great access to everything - especially with a subway station right across the street (which would recommend any visitor to embrace and use - it defintely is the best and most efficient way to get around, especially with the all you can ride $7 a day 'fun pass'.Would definetly go back to the Hotel Giraffe - staff was very nice, room was very comfortable, and the location gave us access to all of Manhatten in a convenient manner. And as for New York hotels are concerned, felt the total experience we got was good value relative to what we would pay at a compriable hotel."

We arrived very early and they had noted our request for an early check in but could not accomodate us as the hotel was full the night before, fair enough so we went out to get some breakfast at a local diner even though they offered us the breakfast at the hotel.after a very long day shopping and with Jet Lag lingering we finally checked in and i thought the room was wonderful. We were on a high floor, the room was spacious and spotless. I also thought it was very well decorated.To be honest i could not fault our stay there, the service was superb in every regard, the breakfast was great for a quick bite before heading out and the cheese and wine a nice touch although we never were there to enjoy it.We had decided to try the Sofitel for the second part of the vacation over new years eve and i thought i was splurging out on a special treat, i wish i had saved the $$'s and stayed at the Giraffe.I would not hesitate to reccomend this hotel to anyone who doesn't feel they need to be in times square."
